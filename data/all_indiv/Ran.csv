10.0,"My third favorite Kurosawa film- deliberately paced (not painfully so), heavy on tragedy, and glorious in overall artistry","I would agree with Ebert's review on a point, that Akira Kurosawa, legendary director of such samurai classics as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, and Kagemusha, as well as human dramas like Rashomon, The Lower Depths, and Red Beard, could really best direct this film in his old age. There's something about his version of the doomed King Lear of Shakespeare, his Lord Hidetora Ichimonji that could be truly captured by someone in old age. Not to say that directors can't make great films when they're young, or in middle age, about a man in the dark days of the golden years (About Schmidt, Tokyo Story, Bob Le Flambeur, and Kurosawa's own Ikiru come to mind). But it's clear that Kurosawa must've seen or felt or understood at least an element of Hidetora's character, something that goes beyond tragedy that is stuck with all who are mortal. At one point when Hidetora is in a wandering, dazed state he says ""I am lost"", to which his companion/caretaker Kyoami responds ""Such is the human condition."" Was Kurosawa lost as an artist and filmmaker as he tried to get his epic (which at the time of it's filming was the most expensive Japan had seen, and got some extra backing from outside European backers) off the page and onto celluloid? Hard to say, but the end result displays that even in his later days he could create a work so wonderful, so sad, so brutal, and so human that it will remain timeless. If Kurosawa deserves praise for look of the film, the pacing, the editing, every single painstakingly storyboarded (painted) shot, and his direction with the two battle sequences as well as with the quieter, more compelling scenes with the actors, the man who plays Hidetora deserves some as well (like any production of King Lear, including Godard's wild treatise with Burgess Meredith in the lead role, the actor is as important as the writer). Tatsuya Nakadai, who had roles in past Kurosawa films as a young man in Yojimbo (the gunslinger) and Sanjuro (the opponent), is awe-inspiring. Early in the film, after a mind-shattering dream, his character decides to split up his kingdom unto his three sons (Jiro, Saburo, and getting the first castle and all control, Taro), he still feels in control, and has the look of a Lord with just the right level of stubbornness and, unfortunately, naivety. Then, as everything he owns crumbles before him, there is one scene that struck me as remarkable, and then for the rest of the film I couldn't take my eyes off of Nakadai whenever he was on screen. It involves the first battle sequence, in which one of his son's comes to take over a castle, and killing all of Hidetora's men. Look at Nakadai in the scene where he's sitting down stone-faced amid the chaos going on outside, and then as he somehow manages to walk out, the fellow soldiers making way for him. He then sees one of his sons, the betrayer, and he doesn't say a word- he's already decided that his son Taro has gone too far with his position, as he rules over his domain and scares the peasants right out of the picture- and he simply walks away, as his family continues to crumble under corruption of the mind and heart.It's a sequence like that though, where the great Lord makes such a radical change, where Kurosawa and Nakadai have some of their greatest time ever on a screen. As the filmmaker treats the battle, up to a point, like a feudal-Japanese version of a Eisenstein battle (no talk, no sound effects, just the eerie, sorrowful score here applied by Toru Takemitsu) with devastation and visceral nature taken to a poetic, thoughtful level, the actor's eyes and body language are, well, indescribable almost. And if Nakadai gives the finest male performance of the film, credit is equally due to the pivotal female character, Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), who is like a Lady Macbeth taken to the next level. This is a character that's seen Lord Ichimonji destroy his castle when she was young, and now that she has her son(s) right in the palm of her hand, she'll have her revenge in guise of ego-feeding. I may not be able to recommend Ran on one level, despite it being on the painter's equivalent of a splendorous, seething portrait of royalty. Kurosawa takes his time telling the story, and to some it might even feel longer than his epic Seven Samurai. This is a work heavy on emotional nuance, on how the characters (in particular Hidetora) look unto their surroundings, how the presence of destruction and war and slayings are traumatic as opposed to being 'cool' in a stylistic way. If you're looking for a slam-bang action thriller look, elsewhere. But if you're looking for a mature film about life, death, loss, and the bonds that are kept within families, the mind, and how we accept and give forgiveness (a blind character named Lord Tsurumaru is stunning from a certain point of view), this is it. As well for the Shakespeare fan it's an absolute must-see, and it may even turn some onto Shakespeare's classic due to the fact that this film, much like Throne of Blood, contains none of the language style used in the source.",my third favorite kurosawa film deliberately paced not painfully so heavy tragedy glorious overall artistry,i would agree with eberts review point that akira kurosawa legendary director such samurai classics as seven samurai yojimbo hidden fortress kagemusha as well as human dramas like rashomon lower depths red beard could really best direct this film his old age theres something about his version doomed king lear shakespeare his lord hidetora ichimonji that could be truly captured by someone old age not say that directors cant make great films when theyre young or middle age about man dark days golden years about schmidt tokyo story bob le flambeur kurosawas own ikiru come mind but its clear that kurosawa mustve seen or felt or understood at least element hidetoras character something that goes beyond tragedy that is stuck with all who are mortal at one point when hidetora is wandering dazed state he says i am lost which his companion caretaker kyoami responds such is human condition was kurosawa lost as artist filmmaker as he tried get his epic which at time its filming was most expensive japan had seen got some extra backing outside european backers off page onto celluloid hard say but end result displays that even his later days he could create work so wonderful so sad so brutal so human that it will remain timeless if kurosawa deserves praise look film pacing editing every single painstakingly storyboarded painted shot his direction with two battle sequences as well as with quieter more compelling scenes with actors man who plays hidetora deserves some as well like any production king lear including godards wild treatise with burgess meredith lead role actor is as important as writer tatsuya nakadai who had roles past kurosawa films as young man yojimbo gunslinger sanjuro opponent is awe inspiring early film after mind shattering dream his character decides split up his kingdom unto his three sons jiro saburo getting first castle all control taro he still feels control has look lord with just right level stubbornness unfortunately naivety then as everything he owns crumbles before him there is one scene that struck me as remarkable then rest film i couldnt take my eyes off nakadai whenever he was screen it involves first battle sequence which one his sons comes take over castle killing all hidetoras men look at nakadai scene where hes sitting down stone faced amid chaos going outside then as he somehow manages walk out fellow soldiers making way him he then sees one his sons betrayer he doesnt say word hes already decided that his son taro has gone too far with his position as he rules over his domain scares peasants right out picture he simply walks away as his family continues crumble under corruption mind heart its sequence like that though where great lord makes such radical change where kurosawa nakadai have some their greatest time ever screen as filmmaker treats battle up point like feudal japanese version eisenstein battle no talk no sound effects just eerie sorrowful score here applied by toru takemitsu with devastation visceral nature taken poetic thoughtful level actors eyes body language are well indescribable almost if nakadai gives finest male performance film credit is equally due pivotal female character lady kaede mieko harada who is like lady macbeth taken next level this is character thats seen lord ichimonji destroy his castle when she was young now that she has her son s right palm her hand shell have her revenge guise ego feeding i may not be able recommend ran one level despite it being painters equivalent splendorous seething portrait royalty kurosawa takes his time telling story some it might even feel longer than his epic seven samurai this is work heavy emotional nuance how characters particular hidetora look unto their surroundings how presence destruction war slayings are traumatic as opposed being cool stylistic way if youre looking slam bang action thriller look elsewhere but if youre looking mature film about life death loss bonds that are kept within families mind how we accept give forgiveness blind character named lord tsurumaru is stunning certain point view this is it as well shakespeare fan its absolute must see it may even turn some onto shakespeares classic due fact that this film much like throne blood contains none language style used source,0.4595607235142118,0.11941214470284232,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,The Best Film based on one of Shakespeare Best Works. This Masterpiece is recommended for anyone that loves movies . Truly one of the Greatest Films of all time!,"Akira Kurosawa's 1985, Ran, is based one of Shakespeare's greatest works, King's Lear. The Film proudly stands along with his other classic such as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Roshomon, Sanjuro and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.This movie is about an aging lord, head of the Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro, the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is, with astonishing story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius",best film based one shakespeare best works this masterpiece is recommended anyone that loves movies truly one greatest films all time,akira kurosawas 1985 ran is based one shakespeares greatest works kings lear film proudly stands along with his other classic such as seven samurai yojimbo roshomon sanjuro hidden fortress he is master art filmmaking no one can film epic battle scene quite like kurosawa this is recognized as most expensive film ever made by akira kurosawa it was at that time japans most expensive film ever being at age 75 he still showed us hes one best business this movie is about aging lord head ichimonji family decides retire pass power taro eldest his three sons he will however have banish saburo youngest one who dared speak truth him soon former lord is chased away castles his sons becomes mad when he understands that one his sons is trying kill him three brothers are fighting control kingdom as their lust power grows every day four armies are facing each other prairie lord ichimonjis former peaceful kingdom is nothing but distant memory akira kurosawa redefines what epic film is with astonishing story telling entirely believable characters real life battle scenes without use special effects cgi he retells story king lear his own way no one would recognize that it was actually adaptation beforehand but just like shakespeare there is humor irony death not happy ending everyone who played part production this film deserves some kind recognition acting is pretty much excellent certainly believable 10 10 kurosawa is genius,0.546218487394958,0.27594537815126047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,A film requiring patience with huge rewards for the viewer!,"The 'Kurosawa' adaptation of King Lear in his film 'Ran' is a tremendous memorable film.It is a very dramatic film with many soliloquies and dialogue, but if you are patient with it, you are treated to some of the most epic scenes of cinematic brilliance that Kurosawa made. After all it is Shakespeare and one must be patient with it if they are not a fan of the old school theatre.Colourfull clashing armies, The lord awaiting his fate in a burning castle, a brilliant execution scene (I consider the BEST I have ever seen film ever), and the blind being left in the hands of Buddha?While Seven Samurai will always be his perfection, Ran is more than an enjoyable movie that should be seen.

,Be prepared to be awe-struck!,"With RAN (1985) Akira Kurosawa seems to be setting up a macarbe trap. The first section of the film is slow, following an aging warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai's best acting in a long wonderous career.) dividing his castles amongst his unsavory sons. The action is slow, people talk in low tones, it's almost at snail's pace. But then, a battle scene like nothing you ever seen before explodes on the screen. The film takes a 180 degree turn and becomes more and more sinister, more compelling. You can't look away. Akira Kurosawa (1910-1997) was responsible for elevating Japanese cinema to a front-runner in world cinema. Two of his films, RASHOMON and SEVEN SAMURAI were made in less than ten years after World War II. These films put a spotlight on Japanese culture. Some of his later films, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS, THE BAD SLEEP WELL, YOJIMBO and HIGH AND LOW became the basis for a good percentage of the major American films produced after 1960.If you sit down to see RAN, be prepared for a jaw-dropping experience.",be prepared be awe struck,with ran 1985 akira kurosawa seems be setting up macarbe trap first section film is slow following aging warlord tatsuya nakadais best acting long wonderous career dividing his castles amongst his unsavory sons action is slow people talk low tones its almost at snails pace but then battle scene like nothing you ever seen before explodes screen film takes 180 degree turn becomes more more sinister more compelling you cant look away akira kurosawa 1910 1997 was responsible elevating japanese cinema front runner world cinema two his films rashomon seven samurai were made less than ten years after world war ii these films put spotlight japanese culture some his later films hidden fortress bad sleep well yojimbo high low became basis good percentage major american films produced after 1960 if you sit down see ran be prepared jaw dropping experience,0.33138888888888884,0.06905753968253966,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,Jester and Warlord,"'Ran' is the Japanese word for chaos, riot, dissension. Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece is indeed a feast of destruction and perdition, charged with symbols and powerful in pictures like it is found very rarely in today's cinema.The dusky story is based on Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. In the film a Japanese warlord celebrates his own downfall. Kurosawa devised this with a radical film language which works with certain imageries of colors, rapid cut sequences and a sophisticated sound design. When the colorful flags of the different armies get intermixed in a battle, when the peacefully quiet wind (which carries the soundtrack) swells to a raving storm or when long wide shots suddenly segue into shots of details that follow hot on each other's heels then you realize Kurosawa's incredible style which deeply influenced the cinema worldwide.The drawings of the characters are equally terrific. Hidetora's jester is for a certain reason always at the side of the warlord. Their relationship alters as the film continues: Jester and warlord change their roles which makes it hard to distinguish both. Just as the sky turns from blue to grey with dark clouds, the violent past of Hidetora is catching up the aging lord. His trail of murder and predation is not forgotten, the brutally conquered land still carries the old scarves of war and exploitation which now burst out again.The viewer can take this monumental work as a warning to the destructive power of war, which is even decades later at present and beset those who seed the violence.",jester warlord,ran is japanese word chaos riot dissension akira kurosawas masterpiece is indeed feast destruction perdition charged with symbols powerful pictures like it is found very rarely todays cinema dusky story is based shakespeares king lear film japanese warlord celebrates his own downfall kurosawa devised this with radical film language which works with certain imageries colors rapid cut sequences sophisticated sound design when colorful flags different armies get intermixed battle when peacefully quiet wind which carries soundtrack swells raving storm or when long wide shots suddenly segue into shots details that follow hot each others heels then you realize kurosawas incredible style which deeply influenced cinema worldwide drawings characters are equally terrific hidetoras jester is certain reason always at side warlord their relationship alters as film continues jester warlord change their roles which makes it hard distinguish both just as sky turns blue grey with dark clouds violent past hidetora is catching up aging lord his trail murder predation is not forgotten brutally conquered land still carries old scarves war exploitation which now burst out again viewer can take this monumental work as warning destructive power war which is even decades later at present beset those who seed violence,0.5296082949308756,0.051674347158218135,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic,"Ran is probably cinema's greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic, ironically coming from an oriental film-maker. Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. The story focuses on a senile warlord, who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter, ergo he renounces to his three sons, hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee, but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son's audacious defiance, he tries to console him, only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son's impertinence and censure, he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read, for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran. The brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can't help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy, deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude, though doesn't feature an utterance of even a single syllable, the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa's brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis. A must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema. Highly recommended: 10/10.",greatest rendition shakespearean epic,ran is probably cinemas greatest rendition shakespearean epic ironically coming oriental film maker adapted by kurosawa shakespeares king lear ran undoubtedly features amongst best works master auteur it captures with sheer vividness surreal resplendence true essence human struggle survival highlighting cruelties associated with life ran is strictly indicative sole consistency life i e change attribute that not only makes humans vulnerable but also gives them hope rise after fall story focuses senile warlord who owing his senescence is rapidly losing his strength his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years relentless savagery ruthless slaughter ergo he renounces his three sons hoping them establish sort triumvirate with eldest son having slight edge his two elder sons accept proposal with rapturous glee but his youngest son seems bemused questions wits patriarch taking untimely decision though arrantly annoyed by his sons audacious defiance he tries console him only find him inconsolable deeply hurt by his sons impertinence censure he reluctantly banishes him enthrones two elder sons rest is rather worth watch than read there is nothing that can better sumptuous elegance ran brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking say least especially war scene that depicts fate casting final blow ruthless reign warlord brutality bloodshed depicted very scene can make even cold blooded appear jittery ran portrays poetic justice such relentless abominable fashion that one cant help but sympathize with narcissistic warlord who spent his life arrogating annihilating innocent souls plaintive score gives movie much desired tone mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop but also immensely adds its poignant beauty final scene featuring blind boy deeply clutched by his haplessness gross solitude though doesnt feature utterance even single syllable playback mystical flute makes scene haunting as well as mesmerising worth thousand words ran is classic example kurosawas brilliance perhaps consummation his apotheosis must watch eclectic viewers admirers pristine cinema highly recommended 10 10,0.5966883116883118,0.08326298701298702,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Very well made,"One of the last great films directed by Akira Kurosawa. A father gives his land and his power to his three sons. They turn against each other and against their father.Based on Shakespeare's King Lear 'Ran' is a very good film. It was very expensive and you can see that. Over ten years Kurosawa was busy on this project and in 1985 it was finally there. Very well made, with beautiful costumes, music and cinematography, a great direction and some good performances.

10.0,"Sometimes, given sufficient objectives, even the people who are closer to you than anyone else can turn against you.","In another lengthy samurai epic, Akira Kurosawa approaches the boundaries between family members and the damaging affects of one of his rather common themes - reckless ambition. This is very clearly a Kurosawa film, a respectable trait that is most clear in the cinematography, in which Kurosawa uses many extensive shots with little to no camera movement, as well as the common natural setting, characterized by the far-reaching landscapes of sweeping hillsides. Ran has a fascinating plot about an aging King who considers passing on his empire to his three sons. Lord Hidetora is well into his 70s (maybe Kurosawa saw part of himself in this character?), and he addresses the fact that he cannot go on ruling forever, despite the fact that he fought for his empire for over 50 years. His youngest son disagrees with his proposition of passing on leadership yet maintaining much of his control, yet Hidetora nonetheless divides his kingdom into three parts to his sons, hoping that they will remain allies. As an incentive, he demonstrates with arrows that a single one can be broken easily, but three arrows together cannot be broken as easily. The three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo do not agree with Hidetora's philosophy and, as new leaders of their respective portions of Lord Hidetora's kingdom, they soon begin to fight each other for full leadership. Hidetora is attacked by his own sons and cast out of the kingdom, left to wander hopelessly from castle to castle with no one but his goofy jester at his side, who stays with the Lord entirely out of duty to him. One of Hidetora's three sons eventually returns and tries to patch up their damaged relationship, but before they can do that, he gets killed and Hidetora is left alone again, and the empire that he worked for during most of his life is left in ruins. As is also common in Kurosawa's films, there are a lot of interesting and significant characters in the film that play a substantial role in the story. When we first meet Lady Kaede, the woman who was married to Taro but then forced her way into marriage with his younger brother Jiro (the new Lord) upon Taro's death, she is holding a knife to Lord Jiro, threatening him with blackmail if he does not accept her as his wife. The first thing that makes her interesting is that her objective in marrying Jiro is to ensure herself a comfortable life, and so she can avoid fading into obscurity as the widow of a past Lord. Her blackmail threat has a lot of damaging potential for Jiro, and he accepts her as his wife. From the very start of her role in the film, her ultimate goal was to bring about the downfall of the kingdom in order to avenge her family who had been killed when Lord Hidetora was in power. This is not expected or even hinted at previously in the film, and it gives her character much more depth.There is some great irony in Ran that occurs after Lord Hidetora is banished and is left wandering the endless plains. He and his jester come across a run-down wooden shack at the foot of a hillside, and they approach it, asking for help and shelter. The occupant, after explaining that his home is too poor to offer any shelter, turns out to be a man who, as a boy, had had his eyes gouged out under the orders of Lord Hidetora in exchange for sparing his life. Once the jester and Hidetora are inside, the man explains that he will offer hospitality in the only way that Hidetora left him able, he will play them music on his flute. In this scene, Hidetora is confronted with the terrible suffering which he once imposed, and it is horribly ironic that he is forced to take shelter from someone that he once devastatingly mutilated without a second thought. In Ran, as was also the case in Kagemusha, which is a very similar film in time period and content, Kurosawa again employs a subtler style of directing. Again, he focuses more on the story than on cinematic trickery, and with spectacular results. The extensive use of the motionless camera is stunningly effective, but he also uses it in a different way here. Ran opens with a series of stationary shots of a group of horses standing majestically with their riders on the top of a flowing hillside. Virtually the exact same image is shown from a fairly wide variety of different angles and distances, indicating the vastness of the plains and the power that these characters hold (or will soon hold) over them. Again, a musical score is entirely absent throughout the vast majority of the film, and the same lengthy scenes are employed to a large extent to communicate the story of the film. An example of one of these exceedingly long takes can be seen early in the film when Lord Hidetora first announces his what he intends to do with the leadership of his kingdom. The ending of Ran is definitely realistic, for many reasons. There are no myths perpetuated by it; close family members do not always stand together, even the noblest intentions are not always realized, and no one lives happily ever after. Ran is the story of a man in a position of power who makes a trusting decision that backfires devastatingly, and the ensuing madness is not altered to make way for a happy ending. It seems that Kurosawa was trying to capture the militarily charged atmosphere that is present in times of war, and the things mentioned above are some of the many efforts he made to make it all as real as possible, even at the expense of the audience's emotions.",sometimes given sufficient objectives even people who are closer you than anyone else can turn against you,another lengthy samurai

7.0,Strong but Sloooooooowwww,"I am not certain, but I think Ran was Akira Kurosawa's last big feature. Visually, It might be his most distinctive. Being in color opens a lot of doors to cinematography, and makes it easier to see how much artistic creativity went into the sets and costumes. There is something else distinctive about Ran. It is his slowest picture. You need extreme patience to make it through this very long movie, and you also need to understand the context of the story.Ran is Kurosawa's retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear, which many scholars say is his most difficult tragedy. The premise is identical, revolving around an old monarch who is ruined by the corruption of his sons, after he gives them power and authority. (In King Lear, they were daughters, not sons, of course.) Ran starts and ends strongly, but the problem comes down to a huge, plodding middle section. This part of the film will really test your attention span. Kurosawa deliberately makes sure that nothing happens, because he wants to evoke one single emotion...isolation. He places his principal character (and a couple of others) in the middle of nowhere, with no story progression, music, or major dialog. There are perhaps one (or even two) too many similarly grim scenes.The battles scenes are the biggest in Kurosawa's forty year body of work. Not only do they feature swords and spears but guns, cannons, and a cast of thousands. The interesting thing about those scenes is that Kurosawa, doesn't intend them to be rousing or exciting. Instead, there is a strange emotional feeling generated. The most memorable part of Ran is the very last sequence, which is visually brilliant and really disturbing. He makes a metaphor about the frailty of humanity by showing a blind man in a very particular place.Ran will leave you thinking long and hard. I have not seen a film like it and I don't think I ever will. It is not my favorite Kurosawa, but it is very much worth watching.",strong but sloooooooowwww,i am not certain but i think ran was akira kurosawas last big feature visually it might be his most distinctive being color opens lot doors cinematography makes it easier see how much artistic creativity went into sets costumes there is something else distinctive about ran it is his slowest picture you need extreme patience make it through this very long movie you also need understand context story ran is kurosawas retelling shakespeares king lear which many scholars say is his most difficult tragedy premise is identical revolving around old monarch who is ruined by corruption his sons after he gives them power authority king lear they were daughters not sons course ran starts ends strongly but problem comes down huge plodding middle section this part film will really test your attention span kurosawa deliberately makes sure that nothing happens because he wants evoke one single emotion isolation he places his principal character couple others middle nowhere with no story progression music or major dialog there are perhaps one or even two too many similarly grim scenes battles scenes are biggest kurosawas forty year body work not only do they feature swords spears but guns cannons cast thousands interesting thing about those scenes is that kurosawa doesnt intend them be rousing or exciting instead there is strange emotional feeling generated most memorable part ran is very last sequence which is visually brilliant really disturbing he makes metaphor about frailty humanity by showing blind man very particular place ran will leave you thinking long hard i have not seen film like it i dont think i ever will it is not my favorite kurosawa but it is very much worth watching,0.5296466364323508,0.11103269085411942,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Akira Kurasawa's take on King Lear,"I loved Kurasawa's Throne of Blood, and heard this was even better. And indeed it was, for me second only to Seven Samurai as his best film and one of the finest movies ever made. As with any Kurasawa film, it is superbly made with the camera work in look and technique masterly and the colour and period detail really sumptuous. The battle sequences are even more epic in scope and emotional impact than Seven Samurai, aided by the spectacle and camera work. The music is rousing and haunting, almost sometimes paying homage to Mahler, the script is literate and thoughtful and the story intensely moving. Add to that Kurasawa's ever immaculate direction and the truly remarkable lead performance Tatsuya Nakadai and you have an even more brilliant film. Rounding off is the truly Machiavellian performance of Mieko Harada as the daughter-in-law figure. The over-two-and-a-half-hour length and slow pacing didn't hinder Ran in the slightest, at least to me anyway, though some not used to Kurasawa's style may be deterred. In conclusion, there wasn't much I really could add to the wonderful reviews already, but I do think Ran is a superb film with much to admire. 10/10 Bethany Cox",akira kurasawas take king lear,i loved kurasawas throne blood heard this was even better indeed it was me second only seven samurai as his best film one finest movies ever made as with any kurasawa film it is superbly made with camera work look technique masterly colour period detail really sumptuous battle sequences are even more epic scope emotional impact than seven samurai aided by spectacle camera work music is rousing haunting almost sometimes paying homage mahler script is literate thoughtful story intensely moving add that kurasawas ever immaculate direction truly remarkable lead performance tatsuya nakadai you have even more brilliant film rounding off is truly machiavellian performance mieko harada as daughter law figure over two half hour length slow pacing didnt hinder ran slightest at least me anyway though some not used kurasawas style may be deterred conclusion there wasnt much i really could add wonderful reviews already but i do think ran is superb film with much admire 10 10 bethany cox,0.5666666666666667,0.38106060606060604,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,The Greatest Shakespeare Film,"Throughout his career Kurosawa strove to achieve what he called ""real cinema"", proclaiming that ""in all [his] films, there's [only] three or four minutes"" of such quality. Many would argue that he was his greatest critic. For if not in ""Seven Samurai"", then definitely in ""Ikiru"" and if not in ""High and Low"", then definitely in ""Rashomon"" he must have achieved this plateau of greatness. Well, if not in any of his other films, then definitely in ""Ran"" Kurosawa finally came to the apex of cinematic artistry. With the both lyrical and grandiose tone of its craft, its beautifully spare imagery, its haunting score by Toru Takemitsu, and its lead Tatsuya Nakadai's masterful understated performance, ""Ran"" is perhaps the most fully realized epic ever made.The tale, which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"", begins as Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and his court are out hunting. During a break in the hunt, Hidetora proclaims his adbication from the hight seat of the Great Lord and bestows his lands unto his three sons, dividing them up equally. He declares his oldest to be his successor in power. When his youngest son and one of his faithful nobles, express their concerns on this idea, Hidetora foolishly banishes them both, mistaking their advice as insolence. With this opening scene, the peaces are aligned and soon 'chaos' as the film is aptly named will break out throughout the land. From here, we see the downfall of Hidetora and all those who surround him. The film retains all the themes of the original play, but also thanks to Kurosawa's own input addresses a slew of even more varied ideas. Like Shakespeare, Kurosawa is greatly interested in the responsibility of the leader and the hypocrisies and ironies of an autocratic system. The most obvious though not the central theme in the whole film is war, and Kurosawa explores this theme to its full extent throughout the film. In perhaps the most grandiose battle scene every filmed, he demonstrates the destructive consequences and the paradoxical beauty of conflict.Here, Kurosawa implements the camera with masterful skill not once employing the editing/photography tricks and gimmicks so often seen in films (even the good ones) today. This director has an awareness of the past and the history of film, but also the creative spontaneity of a true genius. In ""Ran"", he focuses on the more methodically simple yet artistically complex montage of Eisenstein, and on the strict compositions of Ozu. He employs the most basic and yet most artistic of techniques. Each shot is planned to precision, and each cut is made for a purpose. The coreagraphy and blocking of each scene is simple and powerful, and Kurosawa allows the actors to play out these scenes without the intrusion of the camera or the editor. Thus, the director prevents the style from eclipsing the already powerful material he has to work with. Simply put, ""Ran"" is a masterpiece that flows and develops like an opera, from its forebodingly peaceful ouverture to its bloody Shakespearean heart until its final, quietly subdued, and sorrowful denouement.",greatest shakespeare film,throughout his career kurosawa strove achieve what he called real cinema proclaiming that all films theres three or four minutes such quality many would argue that he was his greatest critic if not seven samurai then definitely ikiru if not high low then definitely rashomon he must have achieved this plateau greatness well if not any his other films then definitely ran kurosawa finally came apex cinematic artistry with both lyrical grandiose tone its craft its beautifully spare imagery its haunting score by toru takemitsu its lead tatsuya nakadais masterful understated performance ran is perhaps most fully realized epic ever made tale which is adaptation shakespeares king lear begins as lord hidetora ichimonji his court are out hunting during break hunt hidetora proclaims his adbication hight seat great lord bestows his lands unto his three sons dividing them up equally he declares his oldest be his successor power when his youngest son one his faithful nobles express their concerns this idea hidetora foolishly banishes them both mistaking their advice as insolence with this opening scene peaces are aligned soon chaos as film is aptly named will break out throughout land here we see downfall hidetora all those who surround him film retains all themes original play but also thanks kurosawas own input addresses slew even more varied ideas like shakespeare kurosawa is greatly interested responsibility leader hypocrisies ironies autocratic system most obvious though not central theme whole film is war kurosawa explores this theme its full extent throughout film perhaps most grandiose battle scene every filmed he demonstrates destructive consequences paradoxical beauty conflict here kurosawa implements camera with masterful skill not once employing editing photography tricks gimmicks so often seen films even good ones today this director has awareness past history film but also creative spontaneity true genius ran he focuses more methodically simple yet artistically complex montage eisenstein strict compositions ozu he employs most basic yet most artistic techniques each shot is planned precision each cut is made purpose coreagraphy blocking each scene is simple powerful kurosawa allows actors play out these scenes without intrusion camera or editor thus director prevents style eclipsing already powerful material he has work with simply put ran is masterpiece that flows develops like opera its forebodingly peaceful ouverture its bloody shakespearean heart until its final quietly subdued sorrowful denouement,0.5902838827838827,0.25198717948717947,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,RAN - A Classic Of Its Time And For All Time,"Based on Shakespeare's King Lear, this film follows the story of the aging warlord Hidetora who, in an attempt to restore peace, divides his kingdom between his three sons - Taro, Jiro, and Saburo - and retires from his duties. However, one of his sons sees this as unwise and is banished by his father, leaving his two brothers in charge of two of the three castles left in their hands. It isn't long before they are overtaken by greed and eventually betray their father, leaving him in the hands of a philosophical jester and a loyal retainer. This betrayal ultimately leads to war, dividing the family and driving Hidetora insane.The remarkable script, which contains many of my favorite lines from any film, still manages to break its way through the confinement of subtitles and reveals itself to be one of the richest Kurosawa ever wrote. He has obviously worked equally hard on the look and feel of the film - the cinematography being excellent (example: the long, continuous shot of Saburo's men charging on horseback across a river).There's also something rather frightening about it that I can't quite put my finger on. The first battle, which is the film's turning point, is the most horrifying, yet strangely beautiful, battles ever filmed. A good effect used is the loss of sound, with only Toru Takemitsu's haunting score to be heard. The entire battle lasts less than ten minutes and there is no uplifting or bombastic music to be heard, but in my opinion, it's Ran's finest scene, and thus the finest scene ever.What Kurosawa managed to get rather than give though was excellent performances from his actors, none more brilliant than Tatsuya Nakadai's Hidetora, Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede (a woman similar to Lady Macbeth but with a different hidden agenda), and the strangely-named Peter as Kyoami.",ran classic its time all time,based shakespeares king lear this film follows story aging warlord hidetora who attempt restore peace divides his kingdom between his three sons taro jiro saburo retires his duties however one his sons sees this as unwise is banished by his father leaving his two brothers charge two three castles left their hands it isnt long before they are overtaken by greed eventually betray their father leaving him hands philosophical jester loyal retainer this betrayal ultimately leads war dividing family driving hidetora insane remarkable script which contains many my favorite lines any film still manages break its way through confinement subtitles reveals itself be one richest kurosawa ever wrote he has obviously worked equally hard look feel film cinematography being excellent example long continuous shot saburos men charging horseback across river theres also something rather frightening about it that i cant quite put my finger first battle which is films turning point is most horrifying yet strangely beautiful battles ever filmed good effect used is loss sound with only toru takemitsus haunting score be heard entire battle lasts less than ten minutes there is no uplifting or bombastic music be heard but my opinion its rans finest scene thus finest scene ever what kurosawa managed get rather than give though was excellent performances his actors none more brilliant than tatsuya nakadais hidetora mieko harada as lady kaede woman similar lady macbeth but with different hidden agenda strangely named peter as kyoami,0.5812499999999999,0.16171875000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Masterpiece: arguably Kurosawa's best,"""He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened."" - Tao Te Ching""Ran"" begins with a gorgeous sequence, director Akira Kurosawa treating us to several shots of soldiers on horseback, perched like gargoyles on a series of grassy hills. We assume these men are guarding the borders of some ancient Japanese kingdom, but it turns out they're running security escort for King Hidetora, an elderly warlord who is out hunting with his three sons.The film then quickly becomes a loose retelling of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"", Hidetora announcing his retirement and then proceeding to divide his kingdom equally between his three sons. In true Shakespearean fashion, Hidetora then stands back and watches with sadness as his spawn squabble and wage war, each interested in acquiring more power and respect than the other.But ""Ran"" is not simply a three-way battle between sons. One of the things that becomes apparent with repeated viewings are the subtle power plays being made behind the family. For example, rival warlords form alliances with the three brothers in an attempt to instigate battles between them, and the wife of one brother, Lady Kaede, moves like a serpent, constantly plotting against the King and his sons.Initially we sympathises with King Hidetora. After all, the poor guy loses his family and is forced to watch helplessly as his empire crumbles! But gradually we learn more and more about Hidetora's past; Kurosawa reveals that Hidetora was himself once a ruthless warlord who destroyed kingdoms and killed thousands. By the film's end we've thus witnessed a grand cycle being reset. Hidetora built his empire through violence and bloodshed and lost it likewise, one ruthless King essentially falling whilst another rises to take his place.So ""Ran"", which means ""chaos"" in Japanese, is less about King Hidetora's personal tragedy than it is about human tragedy on a much larger, more cosmic scale. Observe how Kurosawa uses various distancing techniques (he frequently cuts away to shots of cloud filled skies) in an attempt to convey the feeling that we are watching these characters and their petty squabbles from the heavens. With shades of Jancso (""The Red and White"") and Kubrick (""Paths of Glory"", the sublime ""Lyndon""), Kurosawa's camera grants us the vantage point of enlightened Gods.Interestngly, ""Ran's"" aesthetic style is completely different to much of Kurosawa's early work. Kurosawa's pace is slow, his camera rarely moves, close-up shots are rare, the film's acting is stylized and mannered (drawing from Japanese Noh theatre, though perhaps also Brecht?) and characters are held at a distance. Most find this grating - none of the ingratiating of say, a David Lean epic - but this is a more mature, deeper and less imitable Kurosawa. Whilst his earlier features have been imitated to death, perhaps to the point where they have lost some of their power, ""Ran"" remains sublime.Gone also are the usual Kurosawan moral platitudes. There is little preaching here, and few of the trite moral lessons and dips into sentimentality that mar many of Kurosawa's early films. Indeed, it seems that Kurosawa only matured into a ""serious"" artist in the years leading up to and after his failed suicide attempt. He achieved a sort of gerotranscendence with his later films, shifting to a more transcendent vision of the world. These films thus have a very holistic view of time and space, life and death, moving away from ego-centricism to a more cosmic world-view. Perhaps such an artistic shift was spurred on by Kurosawa's own existential crisis in the early 70s.King Hidetora himself achieves gerotranscendence after a failed suicide. It is then that he stumbles upon a blind man who was once the victim of his past savagery. Forced to directly confront his past, his self image no longer based on illusions of heroism and glory, Hidetora promptly becomes a tormented spirit. Kurosawa has him wear a white face mask from this point onwards, tearing across the landscape like a ghost.""Ran"" ends with a powerful sequence. An army marches in the foreground whilst, far in the distance, a blind man walks dangerously close to a cliff's edge, tentatively tapping away at the earth with his walking cane. The man's walking cane then hits open air, he stumbles slightly and the film abruptly ends. Kurosawa's point is clear: humanity is blind, perpetually on the verge of tumbling down some dark abyss. But note too how the blind man is elevated, far above the army down below. He may risk falling, but he, unlike most in the film, has begun his long climb back toward virtue. ""Ran"" is packed with similar, cleanly drawn ""metaphors"", though at times Kurosawa's dialogue is ridiculously direct. Entire sequences of the film spell out Kurosawa's themes, character dialogue signposting the director's moral messages at every turn. It's all at times very hokey (subtler in Japanese?).Needless to say, Kurosawa's compositions and use of colour are dazzling. At times the film seems like a series of landscape paintings and the master's soundtrack is also fairly experimental.Note to younger viewers, preconceptions in tow: there are no ""cool"" samurai battles here, only a melancholic battle sequence which Kurosawa shoots without sound. Such sequences are nightmarish rather than gratuitous, Kurosawa balking at the horror that other directors salivate over. ""Ran's"" stylized acting also takes some getting used to, requiring several viewings to fully absorb the film's various character motivations, traits, names, nuances and faces. One character, a copy of the court jester in ""King Lear"", is particularly annoying until we properly tune in to his role. Like Shakespeare's jester, he exists outside the story, designed to comment on man's follies.9.5/10 - Despite some heavy-handed dialogue, this is arguably Kurosawa's best film, and one which rewards (or gets richer with) repeat viewings, something few films genuinely do.",masterpiece arguably kurosawas best,he who knows others is wise he who knows himself is enlightened tao te ching ran begins

,Noh Lear This is Noh Lear This is Noh Lear,"What a wonderfully varied medium film can be! Here we have a film that is both truly great and in a different way a clumsy mistake.By now you know that this was made by a master filmmaker at the end of his life -- in preparation for ten years and Asia's most expensive film. He intended it to be his last, his masterpiece.The Good: This work of art is a sequence of masterfully composed images. The camera remains stationary or virtually so, and each scene is richly rewarding in all the visual dimensions, including motion. The costumes are the most cinematic I have seen. There is a use of grasshopper sounds that is the best example I know of amplifying an image by sound. The frame of the picture is the landscape -- little takes place indoors, and that action always refers to some larger, exterior motion. In my experience, this is the best complement of Wells' Othello, the most masterful use of interior space I know.I give it a ten because it is a masterpiece in this area of cinematic communication, one that seems exceptionally underaddressed.The Bad: The Master attempted too much in trying to match his cinematic virtuosity by swallowing Shakespeare's Lear to produce an equally rich story. In this he fails -- so many problems here. First, Shakespeare wrote plays for a barren stage where the images grow from the mind, supported by super-rich language and interwoven visual metaphor. The scene grows from our understanding of the character and what that character says. Kurosawa tries it backwards here by placing characters is a vast scheme that came from his own mind, off-screen as it were, and it doesn't quite work.As it happens, Ran's emphasis is on grand motion. Little time is spent on character development, except with the scheming wife of the first son (a story element that has little Shakespearean counterpart). Lear is a play about demons and leaves the question open as to how many are from opportunistic devilment and which are internally generated. All this is discarded here, as well as the Gloucester counterplot. Among the great losses from the source are the continuous examinations of what sight means and what it can conceive. How fertile that would have been as dramatic scaffolding for Kurosawa's vision.There's a problem with language as well. Not knowing Japanese, I cannot judge how rich or intricate in metaphor is the film's dialogue. But the sound and dramatic utility of the speech is about as far from Shakespeare as you can get. Shakespeare uses his actors' speech to simultaneously move the dramatic action and to serve as a surrogate for the viewer's mind. Both the story and your own ruminations on the story are contained therein. This depends on a continuous, predictable assumed rythmic base which is articulated by a rich consonant based, cheating rubato. Japanese consists of staccato vowels that I suspect are overly dramatized in the short blasts we get from these characters. Could hardly be more unShakespearean. I assume there is a Noh legacy being mined here instead, which is not available to this western viewer.A side note: after seeing these battle scenes you'll never appreciate Speilberg's blatant ripoff in the first part of Sgt Ryan.",noh lear this is noh lear this is noh lear,what wonderfully varied medium film can be here we have film that is both truly great different way clumsy mistake by now you know that this was made by master filmmaker at end his life preparation ten years asias most expensive film he intended it be his last his masterpiece good this work art is sequence masterfully composed images camera remains stationary or virtually so each scene is richly rewarding all visual dimensions including motion costumes are most cinematic i have seen there is use grasshopper sounds that is best example i know amplifying image by sound frame picture is landscape little takes place indoors that action always refers some larger exterior motion my experience this is best complement wells othello most masterful use interior space i know i give it ten because it is masterpiece this area cinematic communication one that seems exceptionally underaddressed bad master attempted too much trying match his cinematic virtuosity by swallowing shakespeares lear produce equally rich story this he fails so many problems here first shakespeare wrote plays barren stage where images grow mind supported by super rich language interwoven visual metaphor scene grows our understanding character what that character says kurosawa tries it backwards here by placing characters is vast scheme that came his own mind off screen as it were it doesnt quite work as it happens rans emphasis is grand motion little time is spent character development except with scheming wife first son story element that has little shakespearean counterpart lear is play about demons leaves question open as how many are opportunistic devilment which are internally generated all this is discarded here as well as gloucester counterplot among great losses source are continuous examinations what sight means what it can conceive how fertile that would have been as dramatic scaffolding kurosawas vision theres problem with language as well not knowing japanese i cannot judge how rich or intricate metaphor is films dialogue but sound dramatic utility speech is about as far shakespeare as you can get shakespeare uses his actors speech simultaneously move dramatic action serve as surrogate viewers mind both story your own ruminations story are contained therein this depends continuous predictable assumed rythmic base which is articulated by rich consonant based cheating rubato japanese consists staccato vowels that i suspect are overly dramatized short blasts we get these characters could hardly be more unshakespearean i assume there is noh legacy being mined here instead which is not available this western viewer side note after seeing these battle scenes youll never appreciate speilbergs blatant ripoff first part sgt ryan,0.490909090909091,0.17102272727272727,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.45}"
,Pain and beauty are not mutually exclusive,"Ran takes viewers to a place they would rather not explore on their own. In a world of cruelty, Kurasowa has shown how the moments within the horror can have beauty. Shakespeare wrote King Lear as a mirror on the human condition. We do not have to be kings and princesses to identify with the father's desire for the well being of his children, even if his own life was one of cruelty and pain. We see this theme throughout great literature and film. What Ran has done is to provide the viewer with many small moments within the pain to realize the beauty. Even the moment of epiphany for Hidetora, when his actions achieve his madness, is one of surpassing beauty. As the storm rages outside the small house of the prince he blinded, whose parents he killed, whose sister he forcibly married off, the simple sounds of the flute provide an intense focus on the here and now. It is at this moment when Hidetora recognizes that he himself sowed the seeds of his own destruction. There is no dialogue, no swashbuckling, just the terrible beauty of the music. As with many of Kurasowa's films, despite their epic scope, it is the small paint strokes that make up the master's canvas.",pain beauty are not mutually exclusive,ran takes viewers place they would rather not explore their own world cruelty kurasowa has shown how moments within horror can have beauty shakespeare wrote king lear as mirror human condition we do not have be kings princesses identify with fathers desire well being his children even if his own life was one cruelty pain we see this theme throughout great literature film what ran has done is provide viewer with many small moments within pain realize beauty even moment epiphany hidetora when his actions achieve his madness is one surpassing beauty as storm rages outside small house prince he blinded whose parents he killed whose sister he forcibly married off simple sounds flute provide intense focus here now it is at this moment when hidetora recognizes that he himself sowed seeds his own destruction there is no dialogue no swashbuckling just terrible beauty music as with many kurasowas films despite their epic scope it is small paint strokes that make up masters canvas,0.5357142857142857,0.12941176470588237,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,A Masterpiece of War and Greed,"This is film that everyone needs to see. It brings home the horrors of war, betrayal, and greed. When the kingdom is divided among the sons in this version of King Lear, we just know that the person who bares himself honestly is going to become an outsider. The acting is sensational, with masterful personal encounters. Kurosawa even managed to keep the fool as an integral part of the story. Others have eloquently dissected this movie. What I have to offer is that there is such a poetry to the visual aspects of this film. While the battle scenes are among the goriest and grizzliest that have ever been put on celluloid, there is a dance here, a wave of the most intense coming and going as we watch the soldiers fall.

5.0,Not as great as I thought it would be,"Realizing that it is practically heresy in the film world to criticize a Kurosawa film, much less downright dislike it, I'd like to precede my review by saying that I have absolutely loved every Kurosawa film I've seen  until now. ""Ran"", Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other, saying that they are not deserving, etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject, incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately, banishment from the area. Meanwhile, the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom, leading to wars, fratricide and the dismissal of their father, even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable, only avarice and power motivate them, leading to tragedy for all.Going into this, I knew that this was not going to be a light story by any means. For anyone who has read or is familiar with Lear, it is a story that is pretty much slogged through, though it is wonderfully told. ""Ran"" can pretty much be described the same way. While I certainly appreciated the good acting, the unbelievable costumes and the set design as a whole, I found myself unable to become engaged in the story. The pacing was extremely slow, certainly not an easy thing to deal with during a film that lasts about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it is the pacing, visuals and story that can really make a foreign film a success for me, and I found that ""Ran"" only had one compelling element out of the three, which managed to save it from being an absolute dud, but not enough to make it as awesome as Kurosawa's other films are. (And in using the word awesome, I really mean the word ""awe"") Because of the costumes, at times arresting imagery, and the ultimate fate of Lady Kaede (which bumped up the film by an entire point for me because of its bluntness) I'm not completely panning the film. While I feel the film was a bit disappointing, I'm more disappointed in myself for not being able to like it as much as I would have wanted, since it has had such amazing reviews. But since you can't like them all, ""Ran"" gets a 5/10 from me.--Shelly",not as great as i thought it would be,realizing that it is practically heresy film world criticize kurosawa film much less downright dislike it id like precede my review by saying that i have absolutely loved every kurosawa film ive seen until now ran kurosawas 1985 film based somewhat shakespeares king lear is story elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom oldest his three sons while oldest middle son fan over each other saying that they are not deserving etc it is youngest who speaks his mind about subject incurring wrath his father ultimately banishment area meanwhile two older sons are making mess things with kingdom leading wars fratricide dismissal their father even attempting his murder none their motives are noble or honorable only avarice power motivate them leading tragedy all going into this i knew that this was not going be light story by any means anyone who has read or is familiar with lear it is story that is pretty much slogged through though it is wonderfully told ran can pretty much be described same way while i certainly appreciated good acting unbelievable costumes set design as whole i found myself unable become engaged story pacing was extremely slow certainly not easy thing deal with during film that lasts about 2 hours 40 minutes unfortunately myself at least it is pacing visuals story that can really make foreign film success me i found that ran only had one compelling element out three which managed save it being absolute dud but not enough make it as awesome as kurosawas other films are using word awesome i really mean word awe because costumes at times arresting imagery ultimate fate lady kaede which bumped up film by entire point me because its bluntness im not completely panning film while i feel film was bit disappointing im more disappointed myself not being able like it as much as i would have wanted since it has had such amazing reviews but since you cant like them all ran gets 5 10 me shelly,0.564770299145299,0.11006944444444448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,King Lear turned into a monumental epic in Japanese,"There is nothing wrong with treating Shakespeare at large with any licence, which Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece is a clear evidence of. He sticks mainly to only the skeleton of the play and makes as many deviations as possible, the most remarkable and successful being to let the fool stay on with King Lear throughout the drama to the bitter end, while in the play he is lost half way without an explanation. Instead of troublesome daughters there are troublesome sons, and the youngest proves to be the only true and correct one of them, like Cordelia, and meets with a similar fate but more militarily. In comparison with his earlier masterpiece ""Kagemusha"" there are less horses here and less beautiful music, while the main character of the film with its many devastating battles and massacres is rather apocalyptic, with some marvellous contrasts to the general doom, especially by the female interaction and the blind flutist, who makes something of a frontispiece and symbolic figurehead to the entire epic, adding some profound symbolism. Above all, Tatsuya Nakadai as the troubled old king is the best and most convincing Lear type I have ever seen, transcending even Laurence Olivier's characterization by mere physical acting without speech - his finest part is when he sits totally unmoved while everything around him is burning in the apocalyptic siege of the castle after the first hour. His long white hair, his wild eyes, his impersonation of the ultimate despair by mere movements and expressions - is enough to make this film only for his sake one of the most outstanding and indispensable films in all history - and it was Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece, made when he himself was 75 years old.",king lear turned into monumental epic japanese,there is nothing wrong with treating shakespeare at large with any licence which akira kurosawas ultimate masterpiece is clear evidence he sticks mainly only skeleton play makes as many deviations as possible most remarkable successful being let fool stay with king lear throughout drama bitter end while play he is lost half way without explanation instead troublesome daughters there are troublesome sons youngest proves be only true correct one them like cordelia meets with similar fate but more militarily comparison with his earlier masterpiece kagemusha there are less horses here less beautiful music while main character film with its many devastating battles massacres is rather apocalyptic with some marvellous contrasts general doom especially by female interaction blind flutist who makes something frontispiece symbolic figurehead entire epic adding some profound symbolism above all tatsuya nakadai as troubled old king is best most convincing lear type i have ever seen transcending even laurence oliviers characterization by mere physical acting without speech his finest part is when he sits totally unmoved while everything around him is burning apocalyptic siege castle after first hour his long white hair his wild eyes his impersonation ultimate despair by mere movements expressions is enough make this film only his sake one most outstanding indispensable films all history it was akira kurosawas ultimate masterpiece made when he himself was 75 years old,0.5396683673469387,0.09846938775510206,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.35}"
4.0,Failure at the highest level,"This movie came as a big disappointment to me. I really adore Japanese culture and history and I am a big fan of Asian cinema. I was looking forward to see a film that is considered as a masterpiece by many and has risen to world wide fame.I was surprised to see so many flaws in this film that I don't even know where to start. First of all, the movie is far too long and lacks of fluidity. The story is extremely predictable and develops no tension at all. The script is very poor and unoriginal. It steals several ideas from many other theatre plays and movies. One always feels that one has seen the same story elsewhere before and in a much better way. The beginning is overlong and should have been shortened. The middle part with the scenes in the field and the destroyed castle include many lengths. The ending is not well told and finishes too abruptly on the other side.The battle scenes are a complete fail. We see a shot of soldiers shooting in a forest. In the next shot, we see five soldiers yelling and falling from the horses to die on the ground. Repeat the two shots five times and this is what the battle scenes of this movie are like. There is no action, no aesthetic and no emotion in those scenes. It rather looks like a chess game than a true battle.The dialogues are amongst the poorest ones I have ever witnessed in cinema and I have seen thousand of movies. They are extremely wooden and sometimes so ridiculous that I had to laugh out hard. The scenes including the arrogant, philosophical and schizophrenic fool are annoying. When the old lord gets insane and just always says the same couple of sentences throughout the second half of the movie and shares many scenes with the fool, the whole thing looks like a parody in form of an old fashioned theatre play for kids. Some intellectual people will now talk about the irony that the fool always tells the truth and switches roles with his master and that the poor old man saved the fool and that this action started all the intrigues but this is no excuse for so many poor and repetitive dialogues.The characters are not credible. The movie tries to include many hints at traditional Japanese culture but these elements are exaggerated and don't seem authentic at all to me. The role of the fool that insults everybody around him but stays extremely faithful to his old master once he has gone insane is ridiculous. A man that shows this kind of disrespect would have been executed in traditional Japan. A woman like Lady Kaede would have never been so successful with her predictable intrigues. Any credible husband or brother-in-law would have given an order to execute her. The fact that Lady Sue could easily escape from the castle and go to her brother is not credible at all even if she got help. One would have followed and killed her and the traitor that refuses to obey his master and its sister-in-law would have been executed, too. It also seems strange to me that the lord's adviser finally kills Lady Kaede without getting the order by his superior while the lord stands next to him and doesn't react. I'm not an expert of Japanese history but from what I have seen from other movies, read from several books, known from history lessons and heard from Japanese that I could meet, many of these scenes don't seem realistic to me at all if I think about the severe code of honour of this country.After so many negative aspects, let's mention some positive things. Even though the characters aren't credible and the dialogues are wooden, it's not the mistake by the actors but by the writer and director. The acting itself is well executed and should be praised. It's the only thing that kept me watching this flick until the end. To give you an example, the interpretation of Lady Kaede or the annoying fool are well done from an objective point of view.At the time of its creation, this movie was Japan's most expensive production ever. Akira Korusawa was a big name and he got some good connections. You can see this by the inclusion of many supportive actors, excellent settings and especially many valuable costumes that are created with much detail. The film is quite colourful and beautiful to watch. Only the camera cuts are stiff and some potential is wasted there.Concerning the story, even though the whole thing is predictable, some of the intrigues are still well done. After a weak start and before a weaker second half of the movie, we have around forty-five minutes or so that are really entertaining and have some plot development. This is the strongest part of the movie.In the end, there are some positive points to mention but the weaker ones are in majority. It's definitely not the mistake of the costume makers, the actors or the light and sound engineers that do an almost flawless job. It's the fault of the poor writers and the headless director. Shame on you, Mister Akira Korusawa. Even a big name can't save this film that must be considered as a failure at the highest level. It's not the worst thing I have seen but still below average. I definitely don't recommend this movie to anybody apart of fans of gorgeous costumes and old fashioned theatre plays.",failure at highest level,this movie came as big disappointment me i really adore japanese culture history i am big fan asian cinema i was looking forward see film that is considered as masterpiece by many has risen world wide fame i was surprised see so many flaws this film that i dont even know where start first all movie is far too long lacks fluidity story is extremely predictable develops no tension at all script is very poor unoriginal it steals several ideas many other theatre plays movies one always feels that one has seen same story elsewhere before much better way beginning is overlong should have been shortened middle part with scenes field destroyed castle include many lengths ending is not well told finishes too abruptly other side battle scenes are complete fail we see shot soldiers shooting forest next shot we see five soldiers yelling falling horses die ground repeat two shots five times this is what battle scenes this movie are like there is no action no aesthetic no emotion those scenes it rather looks like chess game than true battle dialogues are amongst poorest ones i have ever witnessed cinema i have seen thousand movies they are extremely wooden sometimes so ridiculous that i had laugh out hard scenes including arrogant philosophical schizophrenic fool are annoying when old lord gets insane just always says same couple sentences throughout second half movie shares many scenes with fool whole thing looks like parody form old fashioned theatre play kids some intellectual people will now talk about irony that fool always tells truth switches roles with his master that poor old man saved fool that this action started all intrigues but this is no excuse so many poor repetitive dialogues characters are not credible movie tries include many hints at traditional japanese culture but these elements are exaggerated dont seem authentic at all me role fool that insults everybody around him but stays extremely faithful his old master once he has gone insane is ridiculous man that shows this kind disrespect would have been executed traditional japan woman like lady kaede would have never been so successful with her predictable intrigues any credible husband or brother law would have given order execute her fact that lady sue could easily escape castle go her brother is not credible at all even if she got help one would have followed killed her traitor that refuses obey his master its sister law would have been executed too it also seems strange me that lords adviser finally kills lady kaede without getting order by his superior while lord stands next him doesnt react im not expert japanese history but what i have seen other movies read several books known history lessons heard japanese that i could meet many these scenes dont seem realistic me at all if i think about severe code honour this country after so many negative aspects lets mention some positive things even though characters arent credible dialogues are wooden its not mistake by actors but by writer director acting itself is well executed should be praised its only thing that kept me watching this flick until end give you example interpretation lady kaede or annoying fool are well done objective point view at time its creation this movie was japans most expensive production ever akira korusawa was big name he got some good connections you can see this by inclusion many supportive actors excellent settings especially many valuable costumes that are created with much detail film is quite colourful beautiful watch only camera cuts are stiff some potential is wasted there concerning story even though whole thing is predictable some intrigues are still well done after weak start before weaker second half movie we have around forty five minutes or so that are really entertaining have some plot development this is strongest part movie end there are some positive points mention but weaker ones are majority its definitely not mistake costume makers actors or light sound engineers that do almost flawless job its fault poor writers headless director shame you mister akira korusawa even big name cant save this film that must be considered as failure at highest level its not worst thing i have seen but still below average i definitely dont recommend this movie anybody apart fans gorgeous costumes old fashioned theatre plays,0.46166055718475074,0.05963919145370757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,King Lear adaptation..and Great!:),"Usually, I don't write comments of movies that have too many reviews. But this one is so good, that I decided to break this rule. Ran is an adaptation of King's Lear, a story from William Shakespeare , very tragic and full of treasons.Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, already old, decides to pass his powers and leadership for his older son,Taro,leading the other two as rulers of the other two castles. Saburo is the only son who says that is not happy with that decision,speaking against his father. This one,being fooled by flattery of the two older sons,decides to banish Saburo of his lands.After this, what comes is a series of perfidiousness of his older sons,and even his daughter in law, lady Kaede,who wants to revenge her family,since they were the true owners of the castle, and were killed by Hidetora.Hidetora becomes mad, and totally exiled from his lands. And he discovers that his son Saburo, was the only one who really was loyal to him.There are many messages in this movie;one of the them,clearly is that not all the compliments are honest, and they can have bad intentions behind. Sometimes,someone near you can look insolent,but is only being honest. It's better a horrible true, than a fake lie,although not all the people are prepared to listen to the true. Not to mention that sometimes, you think that the person who is going to help you,really doesn't care about you,(like Hidetora's older sons) and you find all the help you need, in people you expect to not even be concerned with you. (like Saburo,the exiled son, and even Tsurumaru, who has lost everything he had, including his eyes because of Hidetora, and even on this way, he helps the old man with shelter.)Kurosawa also shows a vision about the mankind: We only search for war and sadness, instead of happiness and peace.

10.0,Awe Inspiring,"At the core of this movie there is a long running philosophical question. Certain characters continually question what is happening around them, and through these questions, the themes of the movie are forthcoming. The most obvious theme is that of war. Here, once again, Kurosawa reminds us that modern warfare is not a place of honour or duels, but massed attacks on faceless enemies, shooting each other from a distance. I will discuss the battle scenes later in this review; they help us examine the chaos that is again consistent throughout the film. It seems that no one in this movie has any control over the events that are transpiring; not even the ultimate manipulator Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede has true control. This lack of control seems to mirror the idea put forward by the only character who is continually able to tell the truth without ramification. Shinnosuke Ikehata (credited here as Peter) is the fool who says 'Are there no gods... no Buddha? If you exist, hear me. You are mischievous and cruel! Are you so bored up there you must crush us like ants? Is it such fun to see men weep?' Even if god exists then the only pleasure he enjoys is watching mankind destroy itself in the chaotic mess that is war. The final scenes see chaos erupt, as through the good natured actions of one man, 4 armies are dragged into a bloody battle. Which leads us to the idea of futility and death. The pointlessness of life is summed up once again by the fool. 'Man is born crying. When he has cried enough, he dies.' Death comes to us all, yet it is far bleaker than that. If there is a god then they allow everyone to suffer. Even a noble character, like Saburo, dies an ignoble and futile death. Everyone within this movie is both hunter and hunted. It is a bleak world indeed.Then we have morality. There are very few 'good' characters here, but there are three exceptions to this. Saburo, Lord Hidetora's third and youngest son, who because of his love and loyalty to his father is unable to not speak out at the foolishness he sees around him, which leads to his banishment. Tango, a loyal servant to Lord Hidetora who is banished with Saburo, but through love for his lord disguises himself so as to stay near him. Finally there is Kyoami, the fool. He again is loyal to his Lord, however, he voices ideas of leaving his side numerous times, but again his sense of duty and even affection keep him with his master.The movie itself is near perfect. Stylistically it is almost like watching a play. Both the staging and the style of acting are clearly very influenced by Japanese Noh theatre, with the slow and deliberate style of acting used, and the mask-like appearance of age notable in the make up of Nakadai as the seventy year old Hiderota. Every shot looks like a masterpiece, perfectly framed. Kurosawa trained as an artist, indeed he painted the storyboard for every shot in the film. The framing is perfect and in most senses the camera does not move at all, or if it does, it is simply to keep the perfection of the shot intact. Kurosawa was a master film maker, this is clear throughout. His confidence with film is breathtaking: only a director totally sure in his craft would dare leave the long, motionless pauses at the end of almost every scene, punctuating what has just happened and allowing the audience to grasp the full implication of the actions taking place.Kurosawa is, of course, well known for his ability to direct action, and this movie recreates war in a way few others have ever managed to do. There are two great battles here, one in the middle and one during the end. The final battle is perfectly staged, riveting, and speaks volumes of the futility that the lust and pride of Jiro Masatoras, Hiderotas second son (played by Jinpachi Nezu) has led to. But for me it is the first battle that is the one of the greatest moments in cinema. Due to council given by a traitor, Lord Hidetora has led his household, which includes 30 warriors, to the castle of the outcast Saburo. It is a trap, and Taro Takatora (Akira Terao), his first son and Jiro strike. What follows is horrific. This is the purist language of movie, and a thing of true genius. On the battlefield, even in the world of the Samurai, there is no honour, no real glory, only ugliness and death.It is interesting to note that seeing someone actually kill another person in this movie is rare. Considering the acclaim Kurosawa has garnered for the sword fighting sequences in so many of his movies it is interesting to note that not once do you see a sword kill another person on screen. Indeed, there are only two times we really witness one person attacking and killing another, other than mutual suicide. The first is entirely shown at a massive distance, the figures barely distinguishable, and the second, despite being amazingly gory, does not actually show the death itself on camera.Yet with all of this emphasis on framing, shot, symbolism and colour, Kurosawa manages to bring to the screen some of the greatest performances I think I have ever witnessed. I have to cut short my praise of what is a faultless cast and talk about Mieko Harada giving perhaps the finest performance in the movie. Driven by anger and vengeance she becomes something other than human, she is some kind of succubus, a temptress, a fox-spirit. Harada is at all times compelling, her every movement one of cold perfection and as we hear her silk robes rustling as she glides along the wooden floors we see before us an unforgettable creation of pure evil.",awe inspiring,at core this movie there is long running philosophical question certain characters continually question what is happening around them through these questions themes movie are

6.0,Daunting descent into despair and desolation,"""Ran"", which means translated ""Revolt"", bit this is not really used as a title for this film, is a Japaese/French co-production from 1985, so it will have its 35th anniversary next year. This movie is linked inevitably with Akira Kurosawa, by many considered the finest non-American filmmaker of all time, and it is a late career effort by him. He had already been in filmmaking for way over 40 years when he came up with this one we got here thatg turned into one of his career-defining movies. It is of course in contrastg to most of his earlier stuff in color and runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes. I guess it was a tribute to Kurosawa that the Academy really appreciated this one as it also could have been a film that could have gone completely under the radar. However, it scored 4 Oscar nominations, one of them being for Best Costume for which it took home the award. And I think all these nominations are not undeserving. On the contrary, one or two acting nominations, for Nakadai and Haradai perhaps, would have been appropriate too. Butg lets get into the film. This is the story of an influential old Lord (played by a much younger actor by the way) who hands on the power to his sons. Too late he recognizes thatg he made a huge mistake that may not only endanger his heritage, but also his life eventually. But while the sons are pursuing their violent path, there is a new threat rising with a women full of revenge. Can the last remaining son help his father find a way out of his misery? Watch for yourself. One thing I want to emphasize here is that I mentioned earlier Kurosawa made many b&w films, but the way he uses colors for this film proves without a doubt that it is a shame he did not make more color films. For example before and after this film, there is a break of five years each. Anyway, with colors I was referring to red, yellow and blue mostly here, the colors symbolizing the sons and their armies. Things get heated for the first time when the old patriarch kills one of his soldiers' sons who was about to kill one of the old man's guards. Blood is not thicker than water in this case and the blue son (lets call him that) predicted it correctly. It takes a long time for the father to understand and a really rocky journey during which he turns from one of the most influential men of his country into an old bum you could say that is considered insane by many.However, he is not, he only may seem that way. His final words and actions show that and even if his body is ailing, his mind should not be mistaken for being gone. I want to elaborate a little bit more on how this film is so different than what an American or probably also European movie about this subject would have looked like completely away from the country where it is set. With this I am mostly speaking about the blue son. We may have seen a from zero to hero storyline involving him à la Gladiator and this would have resulted in a much weaker movie without a doubt. But this is never his movie, not one bit. He is basically gone for almost the rest of the film after he is sent into exile by his father. Even if he was the only one getting it right, this does not mean he is at the center of the story. When he returns, he is killed off pretty quickly and that sure came surprising, even if the father's words about how he has so much to talk about with his son somewhat indicated it would not happen. But yeah, I expected the dad to die, but he sure is a fighter. And when he finally concedes, this results in probably the best moment of spoken language and dialogue, well rather monologue, and again this comes from a character we hardly know anything about when there is an elaboration of how nobody should blame the Gods for humans being greedy and violent enough over centuries to destroy everything and everybody around them in their insatiable hunger for power and always wanting more. Instead on the blue son, the film focuses on the power struggles for those who are in power actually, the yellow son, but evenmoreso the red son, who runs into a woman who is even more ruthless and cold-blooded than he is in exacting her revenge for those she lost and losing them destroyed the last bit of empathy inside her. I must say while watching the film I struggled a bit with this character also how she uses her power and almost kills the red son out of nowhere. It is interesting how women (wives) were far more than quiet bearers back then. But the more I think about this character, the more I like it and I think it is a worthy addition, also shown by the fact that I mentioned the actress deserving a supporting actress nomination at the Oscars. But she was probably too unknown for that. Anyway, fittingly she gets also killed all of a sudden by another minor character. It feels realisic. It is never about the big players doing the crucial deeds here, but just anybody for whom it feels right looking at their anger.Yes this is a really long movie, but in my opinion it felt far shorter than over 2.5 hours I must say. It is definitely with all the customs, traditions and very style-focused sequences not a film that will appeal to everybody, but if you manage to make a connection, then you are in for a high-quality movie. Like mostg other Japanese films, they are doing completely without comedy. Even the foxhead scene that may seem funny to the untraiend eye has far more dramatic depth than just the intent to make you laugh. And even if my rating may not make you think like that, this is one of the most powerful anti-war movies I have seen. It is uncompromising, realistic and not scared of taking untraditional parts when it comes to story-telling. And completely away from the story, this is really a mesmerizing watch visually in terms of cinematography, costumes, make-up and art direction. Something every film student should see really, not just those from Japan. I can see why many years after Kurosawa's death and even more years after films like this one have been made, so many still cite him as a gigantic inspiration and dedicate their works to him. I was lucky enough yesterday to watch the film on the big screen, a really rare occasion for such an old movie, but I am very glad I took it and if you happen to get the same chance I highly recommend you to take it. The more I think about this film, the more I like it. There were more thna just a few scenes and moments that deserve a higher rating than 3 out of 5 stars, but overall this is what I am going with at this point. Maybe I will increase it on rewatch we'll see. Also I want to call this film a formidable period piece as, even if there were firearms included, it plays several centuries in the past. This genre is not just about English royalties, but here we have a very different approach showing everybody how it needs to be done. A real powerhorse of a movie and I am glad it got the attention it received back then and is still seen by many today. Also a huge success from the technical perspective if we look at sound effects mostly and yes the soundtrack is really good too, but also visual effects (the scene where the red and yellow army chase down the old man is a true spectacle and I am saying this as somebody who normally couldn't care less about visual effects). So many high-quality production values here. And to end it all, finally a few words on the very last scene, the blind woman at the abyss. Well, I understood it as follows. She may be blind, but still manages to recognize the abyss before falling into a most certain death. Those who see are not that lucky. Or not that smart you could also say. So you could say Kurosawa leads the human a mind a bit ad absurdum eventually. But that's what he has done all the way before that too because there is no reason to all the insanity in here. That's all folks. Don't miss out on this one.",daunting descent into despair desolation,ran which means translated revolt bit this is not really used as title this film is japaese french co production 1985 so it will have its 35th anniversary next year this movie is linked inevitably with akira kurosawa by many considered finest non american filmmaker all time it is late career effort by him he had already been filmmaking way over 40 years when he came up with this one we got here thatg turned into one his career defining movies it is course contrastg most his earlier stuff color runs over 2 hours 40 minutes i guess it was tribute kurosawa that academy really appreciated this one as it also could have been film that could have gone completely under radar however it scored 4 oscar nominations one them being best costume which it took home award i think all these nominations are not undeserving contrary one or two acting nominations nakadai haradai perhaps would have been appropriate too butg lets get into film this is story influential old lord played by much younger actor by way who hands power his sons too late he recognizes thatg he made huge mistake that may not only endanger his heritage but also his life eventually but while sons are pursuing their violent path there is new threat rising with women full revenge can last remaining son help his father find way out his misery watch yourself one thing i want emphasize here is that i mentioned earlier kurosawa made many b w films but way he uses colors this film proves without doubt that it is shame he did not make more color films example before after this film there is break five years each anyway with colors i was referring red yellow blue mostly here colors symbolizing sons their armies things get heated first time when old patriarch kills one his soldiers sons who was about kill one old mans guards blood is not thicker than water this case blue son lets call him that predicted it correctly it takes long time father understand really rocky journey during which he turns one most influential men his country into old bum you could say that is considered insane by many however he is not he only may seem that way his final words actions show that even if his body is ailing his mind should not be mistaken being gone i want elaborate little bit more how this film is so different than what american or

,Plays on an epic scale but is driven by the hearts of the characters,"Lord Hidetora announces his plans to step down as Lord of his lands and, whilst he does keep title and men, all will pass to his eldest son, with his younger two sons each taking control of the second and third castle. Youngest son Saburo derides his foolishness, claiming that this will split the kingdom and that natural divisions will rise up, but he is dismissed by all and banished by Hidetora for his dissent. So the change begins and internal wrangling occur immediately with Taro's wife Kaede stirring up ill feelings in him against his father.The things about mediocre films is that often they are easiest to watch and so often I pick them over more interesting fare simply because it seems like the easiest thing to do. So-so films offer you little but conspire to take little from you other than time. So I regularly find myself in a position where I have seen lots of films but yet cannot comment on some that are considered classic. Recently I was in Paris for a week break and stumbled upon a showing of paintings and sketches by Akira Kurosawa and, having been watching some of his black and white films of late I paid my money and went in. The paintings were mostly designs for his films and yet again I found myself wondering why I had not seen these films even though I knew of them and had read about them on lots of critic's list. LoveFilm helped me again by supplying Ran off my list a few months later and I'll be honest and say it sat for a few weeks in favour of lesser stuff.Finally seeing it I regret leaving it so long because it is a great film that paints on an epic scale as a clan collapses on itself but still manages to tell the story at a personal level of the corrupted and the corrupters. Unmistakably King Lear in construct, the film is engaging throughout as we have battles and treachery all around but yet the descent into madness of the Lord is still an interesting section to the film, as is the treachery and bitter hate of Lady Kaede. It is a fascinating tale and one that benefits from the richness that Kurosawa is able to give it. His use of open landscapes and convincing period locations adds quality to the film and the whole thing is shot with a great eye for beauty and colour  credit to the cinematographer. The script is functional at times but mostly we have real characters portrayed, which makes the film more engaging as they betray and are in turn betrayed. The cast use this very well but a couple of performances do stand out. Nakadai will appear a bit overdone to Western eyes in his heavy white make-up but this must be accepted in the way it is done, which is a cultural reference. Behind this though his performance is great as he starts powerful and wise but falls through rage into madness. It is a powerful theme of the film that part of his fall is a recognition of what he himself has done in the past and how that is coming for him whether real or imagined. Harada is the second turn that sticks in the mind as she is sly evil personified; not the most subtle of characters perhaps (I preferred the similar character in Throne of Blood) but she dominates her scenes and is quite intimidating as a screen presence due to how well her ruthlessness comes over. The sons are all well played in different ways with Terao, Nezu and Ryu all having different types of material to show what they do. I liked the fool played by Ikehata and how the script used him opposite the Lord and the massive supporting cast of generals and extras are all convincing and stout.Ran does have a hard time going for it in regards modern audiences; not only is it subtitled and over twenty years old but it is also a rough adaptation of Shakespeare  not really anything that a MTV viewer will jump at. However it is worth the jump because it is a great film with consistently interesting themes, strong performances, great direction and a story that runs in the hearts of the characters but is played out on an impressively epic scale. Well worth seeking out and another reason why Kurosawa has the reputation that he does.",plays epic scale but is driven by hearts characters,lord hidetora announces his plans step down as lord his lands whilst he does keep title men all will pass his eldest son with his younger two sons each taking control second third castle youngest son saburo derides his foolishness claiming that this will split kingdom that natural divisions will rise up but he is dismissed by all banished by hidetora his dissent so change begins internal wrangling occur immediately with taros wife kaede stirring up ill feelings him against his father things about mediocre films is that often they are easiest watch so often i pick them over more interesting fare simply because it seems like easiest thing do so so films offer you little but conspire take little you other than time so i regularly find myself position where i have seen lots films but yet cannot comment some that are considered classic recently i was paris week break stumbled upon showing paintings sketches by akira kurosawa having been watching some his black white films late i paid my money went paintings were mostly designs his films yet again i found myself wondering why i had not seen these films even though i knew them had read about them lots critics list lovefilm helped me again by supplying ran off my list few months later ill be honest say it sat few weeks favour lesser stuff finally seeing it i regret leaving it so long because it is great film that paints epic scale as clan collapses itself but still manages tell story at personal level corrupted corrupters unmistakably king lear construct film is engaging throughout as we have battles treachery all around but yet descent into madness lord is still interesting section film as is treachery bitter hate lady kaede it is fascinating tale one that benefits richness that kurosawa is able give it his use open landscapes convincing period locations adds quality film whole thing is shot with great eye beauty colour credit cinematographer script is functional at times but mostly we have real characters portrayed which makes film more engaging as they betray are turn betrayed cast use this very well but couple performances do stand out nakadai will appear bit overdone western eyes his heavy white make up but this must be accepted way it is done which is cultural reference behind this though his performance is great as he starts powerful wise but falls through rage into madness it is powerful theme film that part his fall is recognition what he himself has done past how that is coming him whether real or imagined harada is second turn that sticks mind as she is sly evil personified not most subtle characters perhaps i preferred similar character throne blood but she dominates her scenes is quite intimidating as screen presence due how well her ruthlessness comes over sons are all well played different ways with terao nezu ryu all having different types material show what they do i liked fool played by ikehata how script used him opposite lord massive supporting cast generals extras are all convincing stout ran does have hard time going it regards modern audiences not only is it subtitled over twenty years old but it is also rough adaptation shakespeare not really anything that mtv viewer will jump at however it is worth jump because it is great film with consistently interesting themes strong performances great direction story that runs hearts characters but is played out impressively epic scale well worth seeking out another reason why kurosawa has reputation that he does,0.48027005674064505,0.1062091503267974,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Kurosawa paints a colourful oil on canvas,"The combination of excellent cinema and Kurosawa isn't anything new. In Ran (chaos), he paints his own vision of one of Shakespeare's finest works, 'King Lear'. 'Ran' looks more like an oil painting rather than 'water coloured'. While in 'water' paintings, the colour's are fading, in oil, the colours have a stronger presence signifying their message. He uses various colours to tone the depth of his characters and the relationship between them, to present the mood of the setting and to tell his story. With very brilliantly sophisticated sound effects he brings a raw feel while effectively using the background score in parts. Using his artistic technique, he pays close attention to detail in almost every scene (e.g. the wind, the makeup) without worrying about limiting his final piece to a usual 1.5 hour movie or whether the pace is fast or slow. Of course there must have been some editing but everything in the final piece flows beautifully, revealing a story of love, honour, betrayal, misunderstanding, lust, murder, jealousy, manipulation, greed, madness, redemption, forgiveness and destruction.Tatsuya Nakadai breathes Lord Hidetora Ichimonji. He had starred in many of Kurosawa's films and in 'Ran' he is absolutely a stunner. This is more than an example of great acting because he made me completely forget that I was looking at an actor. Another noteworthy performance is Mieko Harada's as the venomous Lady Kaede. She displays the power of her manipulation and evil intent through her body language while her words are secondary.Immense additional credit must also be given to Kurosawa for skilfully mingling a Shakespearean tragedy into a traditional Japanese historical epic. Clearly he'd done his research well and put a lot of hard work into his painting. The background is signified with much of the Japanese cultures and religious reference.I won't give much of a synopsis as you'll find them in other comments and those who've read King Lear may have an idea. All I'll say that this movie is for those who appreciate real cinema. It is not what others will call 'everyone's cup of tea'. It does make you reflect to the real world how one's expression can be misinterpreted, how life itself is not a happy ending, how dangerous trusting the wrong person can be and how important it is to trust the right person (even a family member), how greed can eat up a person, how the consequences of our actions dictate whether the mistake we made is significant or trivial and how naïve we all are.",kurosawa paints colourful oil canvas,combination excellent cinema kurosawa isnt anything new ran chaos he paints his own vision one shakespeares finest works king lear ran looks more like oil painting rather than water coloured while water paintings colours are fading oil colours have stronger presence signifying their message he uses various colours tone depth his characters relationship between them present mood setting tell his story with very brilliantly sophisticated sound effects he brings raw feel while effectively using background score parts using his artistic technique he pays close attention detail almost every scene e g wind makeup without worrying about limiting his final piece usual 1 5 hour movie or whether pace is fast or slow course there must have been some editing but everything final piece flows beautifully revealing story love honour betrayal misunderstanding lust murder jealousy manipulation greed madness redemption forgiveness destruction tatsuya nakadai breathes lord hidetora ichimonji he had starred many kurosawas films ran he is absolutely stunner this is more than example great acting because he made me completely forget that i was looking at actor another noteworthy performance is mieko haradas as venomous lady kaede she displays power her manipulation evil intent through her body language while her words are secondary immense additional credit must also be given kurosawa skilfully mingling shakespearean tragedy into traditional japanese historical epic clearly hed done his research well put lot hard work into his painting background is signified with much japanese cultures religious reference i wont give much synopsis as youll find them other comments those whove read king lear may have idea all ill say that this movie is those who appreciate real cinema it is not what others will call everyones cup tea it does make you reflect real world how ones expression can be misinterpreted how life itself is not happy ending how dangerous trusting wrong person can be how important it is trust right person even family member how greed can eat up person how consequences our actions dictate whether mistake we made is significant or trivial how na ve we all are,0.5875390913434391,0.1104994643038121,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.41}"
