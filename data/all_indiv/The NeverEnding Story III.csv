,An insult to the series,"The first movie was great. The second wasn't so great, though it's not quite as bad as you've heard. Especially with there now being an even WORSE entry to this series - this being it!Someone questioned why Warner Bros. didn't have the distribution rights to this entry. Well, at first they did. I remember reading a (very negative) review of this movie in ""Variety"" magazine, and Warner Bros. was set to distribute. It's quite obvious now that Warner Bros. threw away its distribution option (probably after seeing how horrible this movie is), and Miramax picked it up for a tiny release that lasted 5 minutes. (In my city, it only played for a few weekend matinees).Oh yeah, what did I think of this movie? Quite frankly, it sucked. What were they thinking when they decided to jazz up the movie with contemporary rock 'n roll???? And most of the movie actually takes place not in the fantasy world, but in this world. The characters are especially obnoxious (especially the rock baby), and suffer from stereotypes. Plus, the movie seems to have forgotten a lot of what happened previously - the hero's dad knew about Fantasia, so the hero didn't have to hide anything from him - but for some reason, the hero keeps the incidents he was involved in a secret. The low point comes where the climax is not solved with magic or intelligence - but with karate. Yes, karate.",insult series,first movie was great second wasnt so great though its not quite as bad as youve heard especially with there now being even worse entry this series this being it someone questioned why warner bros didnt have distribution rights this entry well at first they did i remember reading very negative review this movie variety magazine warner bros was set distribute its quite obvious now that warner bros threw away its distribution option probably after seeing how horrible this movie is miramax picked it up tiny release that lasted 5 minutes my city it only played few weekend matinees oh yeah what did i think this movie quite frankly it sucked what were they thinking when they decided jazz up movie with contemporary rock n roll most movie actually takes place not fantasy world but this world characters are especially obnoxious especially rock baby suffer stereotypes plus movie seems have forgotten lot what happened previously heros dad knew about fantasia so hero didnt have hide anything him but some reason hero keeps incidents he was involved secret low point comes where climax is not solved with magic or intelligence but with karate yes karate,0.5646376811594201,0.00043478260869566704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1.0,So bad it's bad,"When this film showed up on the cable listing, I had a sudden urge to see it even though I knew it was probably going to be terrible. The original was such a staple of my childhood, yet had such an incomplete ending, that I was intensely curious to see what they would do with another sequel. Besides, I knew that it could not possibly be worse than ""The NeverEnding Story II.""Boy, was I wrong.""The NeverEnding Story III"" has rightly earned its place among IMDb voters as the 79th worst movie of all time. It is so bad that, in writing this review, I risk making it sound like it's worth watching, sort of like ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" I assure you, this film is in no way in the Ed Wood category of being so incompetently done that it becomes enjoyable to watch. Those moviegoers who take pleasure in seeing cinematic disasters should be forewarned about this one, lest they never again be able to erase from their memory Rockbiter's gravelly-voiced version of ""Born to be Wild,"" played in a video sequence early in the film and again during the end credits.No, I am not joking.The second film does have its admirers, and as much as I hated it, I sort of understand where they're coming from. At least that film had a legitimate purpose, to tell the second half of the novel which the first film had neglected to do. But now the story is finished, so the third film has to make up its own reason for being, with an even shabbier budget than that of the second film. So it concocts a story that allows us to see as little of Fantasia as possible. Here, a series of magical mishaps causes a bunch of creatures from Fantasia to be transported into the real world. These include Falkor the luck dragon, a baby rockbiter about the size of a fountain statue, and a talking tree. (Falkor, who must have gotten a lobotomy sometime between the second and third film, will chase after a ""dragon"" at a Chinese festival.) What we do see of Fantasia makes the place seem a lot smaller than I had ever imagined. Almost all of the scenes there take place in the empress's chamber in the Ivory Tower, though there is also one sequence where we get to see Rockbiter's home (just what I've always wanted to do!) with Mama Rockbiter and of course the previously mentioned Baby Rockbiter sitting in front of a large stone TV set. Needless to say, the inhabitants of Fantasia seem to possess quite a bit more knowledge of Earth than they did in the first film. When the gnome describes Bastian as ""not exactly Arnold Schwarzenegger in the muscle department,"" we're reminded how much more enjoyable the film would probably be if Schwarzenegger were actually in it.The cause of these events is that a gang of school bullies steals the book and discovers that it gives them the power to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of Fantasia. Strangely, these modern kids never seem surprised that magic exists. Think how long it took in the first film for even imaginative, ten-year-old Bastian to become convinced of the book's supernatural qualities. These bullies, much older and more concrete, never go through such a skeptical period. And later, when the Auryn falls into the hands of a teenage girl, she treats it with about the same level of awe as if she got hold of her parents' credit card.There are actually some familiar actors in this mess. Mr. Koreander is played by the British character actor Freddie Jones, Bastian is played by the kid from ""Free Willy,"" and the main bully is played by a relatively young Jack Black, who now probably would like to do with this film what George Lucas wants to do with the ""Star Wars Holiday Special.""",so bad its bad,when this film showed up cable listing i had sudden urge see it even though i knew it was probably going be terrible original was such staple my childhood yet had such incomplete ending that i was intensely curious see what they would do with another sequel besides i knew that it could not possibly be worse than neverending story ii boy was i wrong neverending story iii has rightly earned its place among imdb voters as 79th worst movie all time it is so bad that writing this review i risk making it sound like its worth watching sort like plan nine outer space i assure you this film is no way ed wood category being so incompetently done that it becomes enjoyable watch those moviegoers who take pleasure seeing cinematic disasters should be forewarned about this one lest they never again be able erase their memory rockbiters gravelly voiced version born be wild played video sequence early film again during end credits no i am not joking second film does have its admirers as much as i hated it i sort understand where theyre coming at least that film had legitimate purpose tell second half novel which first film had neglected do but now story is finished so third film has make up its own reason being with even shabbier budget than that second film so it concocts story that allows us see as little fantasia as possible here series magical mishaps causes bunch creatures fantasia be transported into real world these include falkor luck dragon baby rockbiter about size fountain statue talking tree falkor who must have gotten lobotomy sometime between second third film will chase after dragon at chinese festival what we do see fantasia makes place seem lot smaller than i had ever imagined almost all scenes there take place empresss chamber ivory tower though there is also one sequence where we get see rockbiters home just what ive always wanted do with mama rockbiter course previously mentioned baby rockbiter sitting front large stone tv set needless say inhabitants fantasia seem possess quite bit more knowledge earth than they did first film when gnome describes bastian as not exactly arnold schwarzenegger muscle department were reminded how much more enjoyable film would probably be if schwarzenegger were actually it cause these events is that gang school bullies steals book discovers that it gives them power wreak havoc inhabitants fantasia strangely these modern kids never seem surprised that magic exists think how long it took first film even imaginative ten year old bastian become convinced books supernatural qualities these bullies much older more concrete never go through such skeptical period later when auryn falls into hands teenage girl she treats it with about same level awe as if she got hold her parents credit card there are actually some familiar actors this mess mr koreander is played by british character actor freddie jones bastian is played by kid free willy main bully is played by relatively young jack black who now probably would like do with this film what george lucas wants do with star wars holiday special,0.4312539682539682,0.029595238095238112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1.0,"Wow, and I thought Home Alone 4 was bad!","This movie was awful, easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen, though not quite as abysmal as Home Alone 4, honestly that film is blasphemy. I love the first NeverEnding Story and consider one of the all time great fantasy films, and the second one while disappointing was pretty good, but this one was garbage. Sorry I hated it, it has none of the magic of the first film, none of the sense of wonder that enthralled me when I first saw NeverEnding Story as a child. The scenery was not at all good, dull and rather tacky, I just wonder whether the producers saw the first film for their inspiration, because actually in the first film, the sumptuous set design should've got an award, for it was fantastic. The script here was dreadful, and the plot was uninspired, and had many inconsistencies with the first film(ie. the omission of Atreyu and anything to do with Bastian's family). Not to mention the rushed ending and the rather cartoonish design of Falcor and his voice(ugh!). Even the acting was poor, Jason James Richter has little of the innocence and heroism and even the likability of Bastian, no matter how hard he tried. Jack Black, who I usually find entertaining was wasted and it doesn't help his character was such an unlikeable jerk, as was the usually brilliant Freddie Jones. All in all, awful, awful, awful! See the first film instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox",wow i thought home alone 4 was bad,this movie was awful easily one worst movies i have ever seen though not quite as abysmal as home alone 4 honestly that film is blasphemy i love first neverending story consider one all time great fantasy films second one while disappointing was pretty good but this one was garbage sorry i hated it it has none magic first film none sense wonder that enthralled me when i first saw neverending story as child scenery was not at all good dull rather tacky i just wonder whether producers saw first film their inspiration because actually first film sumptuous set design shouldve got award it was fantastic script here was dreadful plot was uninspired had many inconsistencies with first film ie omission atreyu anything do with bastians family not mention rushed ending rather cartoonish design falcor his voice ugh even acting was poor jason james richter has little innocence heroism even likability bastian no matter how hard he tried jack black who i usually find entertaining was wasted it doesnt help his character was such unlikeable jerk as was usually brilliant freddie jones all all awful awful awful see first film instead 1 10 bethany cox,0.6216269841269841,-0.05843253968253968,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.2}"
2.0,Simply Put? Bad.,"Sadly, the running joke of Engywook and Urgl having to go to the bathroom, but being unable to do so, is one of the entertaining things about this film. But it does get tiresome. And the baby rock-biter is cute, if incredibly stupid. But if you have ever seen the first movie, or read the book, you will most likely not care for this movie at all. The plot is poor, Falcore looks extremely cartoonish as do the Rockbiters, and the Nasties...well, they just aren't that scary.

3.0,"Not one of the finer kids' movies, that's for sure.","I have watched many, many more movies than the average normal person. My tastes are varied...classic films, foreign films, silents and more. But one of my odder pursuits is my weird desire to watch all 100 of IMDB's Bottom 100 List....the 100 lowest rated major release movies. It's important to point out that I have never seen any of the ""Neverending Story"" films and I started with #3. And, since it made the list I thought I'd give it a watch.In this film, Bastian is a kid who appears to be about 10 or 11 year-old. Oddly, he's begun at a new school...one that allows 'kids' there who are nearing retirement age (or so it seems). This small kid is chased and assaulted by a group of 20-something punks (led by 25 year-old Jack Black) and they're going to beat the stuffing out of him. To escape, he uses his magical book to enter the land of Fantasia. The problem is that the punks find the book and keep it...somehow realizing that will keep him stuck in Fantasia forever. But apparently there is another way out....and it's long and complicated and boring. And, somehow, some creatures from Fantasia were accidentally brought to the real world with Bastian...and he needs to find and return them.The Henson creatures vary. A few look really nice. A couple seem rather dated and creepy. What's REALLY dated is the introduction, where you see some very early CGI which looks horrid today. Perhaps in 1994 folks were impressed by it.What doesn't vary much is the writing and acting. The story seemed tired and the characters were often annoying. I particularly hated the rock creature who sang Steppinwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"" sequence and I assume a lot of folks in theaters felt the same way. I also thoroughly hated the bullies...who were old enough that they should have known how to act...but didn't. At least Black landed on his feet and eventually learned to act.So do I recommend it? No...there are much better kid's films out there that WON'T make parents watching along bored. Plus, smaller kids probably shouldn't see it because the bullies are pretty frightening. And who should see it? Probably no one.In spite of this, I don't think the movie deserves to be on the Bottom 100 and think mostly this was the result of folks who loved the original being so angry about the poor quality of this third film.",not one finer kids movies thats sure,i have watched many many more movies than average normal person my tastes are varied classic films foreign films silents more but one my odder pursuits is my weird desire watch all 100 imdbs bottom 100 list 100 lowest rated major release movies its important point out that i have never seen any neverending story films i started with since it made list i thought id give it watch this film bastian is kid who appears be about 10 or 11 year old oddly hes begun at new school one that allows kids there who are nearing retirement age or so it seems this small kid is chased assaulted by group 20 something punks led by 25 year old jack black theyre going beat stuffing out him escape he uses his magical book enter land fantasia problem is that punks find book keep it somehow realizing that will keep him stuck fantasia forever but apparently there is another way out its long complicated boring somehow some creatures fantasia were accidentally brought real world with bastian he needs find return them henson creatures vary few look really nice couple seem rather dated creepy whats really dated is introduction where you see some very early cgi which looks horrid today perhaps 1994 folks were impressed by it what doesnt vary much is writing acting story seemed tired characters were often annoying i particularly hated rock creature who sang steppinwolfs born be wild sequence i assume lot folks theaters felt same way i also thoroughly hated bullies who were old enough that they should have known how act but didnt at least black landed his feet eventually learned act so do i recommend it no there are much better kids films out there that wont make parents watching along bored plus smaller kids probably shouldnt see it because bullies are pretty frightening who should see it probably no one spite this i dont think movie deserves be bottom 100 think mostly this was result folks who loved original being so angry about poor quality this third film,0.5531465599390126,0.0008590623213264807,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1.0,In A Class By Itself,"This movie does belong in a class by itself: Even worse than utterly terrible. I have been an aficionado of 'bad' movies for quite a long time, adoring those movies which only a group of friends and many drinks makes enjoyable. This movie was in fact so amazingly bad that I could not watch it past the first half hour or so. I only watched the rest via fast-forward the next morning. I've seen many films worse considered classically bad, this one beat them all hands down. I even had to start referring to possibly similar bad movies by saying ""They may be in the NS3 category"". There are those bad movies that are MST3K fun and then there are those that make you wish you had a sharp object to commit suicide with, this one is the latter.This franchise went from excellent original fantasy, special effects for the genre, and well written characters to bad acting and writing in part 2, to movie of the week actors and rubber puppets in part 3. It's amazing how a film franchise that had such good promise sank faster than Lips Manless after taking ""the bath"". Especially if you're considering getting this for the kids, at least treat them to the original movie or something like the Peter Barnes inspired fantasy miniseries' from the late 90s.",class by itself,this movie does belong class by itself even worse than utterly terrible i have been aficionado bad movies quite long time adoring those movies which only group friends many drinks makes enjoyable this movie was fact so amazingly bad that i could not watch it past first half hour or so i only watched rest via fast forward next morning ive seen many films worse considered classically bad this one beat them all hands down i even had start referring possibly similar bad movies by saying they may be ns3 category there are those bad movies that are mst3k fun then there are those that make you wish you had sharp object commit suicide with this one is latter this franchise went excellent original fantasy special effects genre well written characters bad acting writing part 2 movie week actors rubber puppets part 3 its amazing how film franchise that had such good promise sank faster than lips manless after taking bath especially if youre considering getting this kids at least treat them original movie or something like peter barnes inspired fantasy miniseries late 90s,0.5719004719004719,-0.04027241527241523,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.15}"
1.0,Why?,"I don't understand why they bothered to make this one. The first Neverending Story really put you in the feeling of a fantasy world. The second was not quite as good. This one? Good Lord! Super trendy, with people in Fantasia watching MTV type television. Falcor wasn't the same voice or personality. It always ruins a good children's movie that is attempting to take you to ""another world"" when they try to make it hip.

1.0,do not ever watch this horrible film,"In the beginning, there was The Neverending Story. It is the best film ever made.Then, there was The Neverending Story II. I'll vent my spleen over that mess later.And then, there came this waste of film and effort. Hold on a minute while I go throw up.While it is a clean, safe film in terms of subject matter, the third NES should never have been made. And I mean NEVER. The first two movies covered all the wondrous things within the original book, so I don't understand why this film was made at all. It is just cheesy, stupid, abysmal, and an absolute disgrace to the idea of The Neverending Story.First of all, what's going on with this stepsister of Bastian's that has somehow appeared? Wrong, wrong. . . Then, what happened to good old Falkor? And most of all, where is Atreyu? If you are bold enough to see this film, that is the one thing you will distinctly notice if you've seen the other two- no Atreyu.The boy who played Bastian was not nearly as obnoxious as the actor from the second film, but he just doesn't hold a candle to the original actor, Barret Oliver. I have only seen this movie once, because I was informed of how awful it was, and just had to see for myself. It was a waste of my precious time. I hardly remember the plot line or anything important like that because it just didn't stick with me. One gets the impression that this was made as a sort of kid/family-friendly approach to The Neverending Story, because it is just so simplistic, and sacrifices the charm of the original characters and settings for the sake of being funny and entertaining. But trust me, it is NOT funny and it is NOT entertaining. Any NES fan worth their salt would be appalled by this film. If however you are not familiar with the Neverending Story, see the original 1984 movie and read the book and be contented with that. Do not subject yourself to the torturous nightmare that is the Neverending Story 3, I implore you. As for a star rating out of ten, I give this film nothing. Nil. Zip.

1.0,We must not give into the Nasty!,"OK, a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films, also really cheap, so I picked them up. The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either, I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright, I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for ""false advertising"" because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways, the second one is just an alright film, a little below average but not terrible. Now, something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it, I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film, throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film, throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying.Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother, Jane, whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends. However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes.See, normally I like bad films, however this was just bad. For God's sake, Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special, this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster Chuck-E-Cheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster, who in the first film was the saddest figure, a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family, his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he's now 1/5 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings ""Born to be Wild"". The villain is no longer an entity; it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black (LOL).There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is, he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie: We must not give into the Nasty! 1/10",we must not give into nasty,ok few years ago i found at target package with all three neverending story films also really cheap so i picked them up first film is one my childhood favorites still holds up this day im not alone this either i didnt realize what kind following film had that others watched it as children too i watched second one when i got package thought it was alright i also thought title was pretty funny wouldnt it be hilarious if some person got lawyer false advertising because title neverending story anyways second one is just alright film little below average but not terrible now something about third gave me chills when i grabbed it i think i should have listened my instincts i dont even know where start with badness now everything that was charming about first film throw it out everything that was trying continue story second film throw it out this is what was puked up two films its terrifying bastian balthazar has begun new chapter his life his father has re married now bastian has new step mother jane whose daughter nicole is displeased at having new family bastian has also started high school where he has become victim nasties quintet bullies led by slip he manages get them expelled by janitor after they trap him boiler room he flees library where he is surprised find mr koreander neverending story nasties locate him but he uses book escape fantasia bastian arrives fantasia where he is reunited with old friends however nasties find neverending story use their cruelty bombard land with fireballs storm now plan steal amulet grant their own nasty wishes see normally i like bad films however this was just bad gods sake valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully made you feel special this valcor looks like thrown out dumpster chuck e cheese costume not mention voice is completely different sounds like some kind ridicules gilligan mook then rock monster who first film was saddest figure giant who lost his friends nothing felt sorrow spoke so beautiful now has family his wife talks like arnold schwartzenegger hes now 1 5 his size his kid wants go motorcycle ride with him while he sings born be wild villain is no longer entity its group bullies called nasties being led by jack black lol there is nothing redeeming about this film acting is terrible only decent enough performance is jack black who you can understand why he was successful because as much bad story as this is he looked like he was having fun costumes are just terrible dont resemble first film by long shot short story is just horrendous magic is taken away this film please take my advice stick first film its wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty wonder second film isnt bad either its worth checking out some ways take advice movie we must not give into nasty 1 10,0.5834533085961657,0.07995810142238713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
5.0,NES III is a movie I really want to like...,"I first saw the first movie a few years ago. I loved it and still love it. I saw the second movie a while later. It was okay then. After two or three viewings I saw Michael Ende's name in the opening credits, and decided to find the book and read it. I can't remember whether I saw NES III before or after I read the book.The book was AMAZING. Probably the best stand-alone novel I have ever read. But the problem is: After you read the book, the movies always look worse because it's not like the book. The first movie is basically based on the first half of the book. A few things were changed and/or left out, but it's still a great movie overall.The second movie is basically based on the second half of the book. A lot of things were changed and a lot of things were left out. This decreased NES II's score a lot, but it's still barely an okay movie.Now NES III is based only on the characters of the book. There's Bastian, of course, but in the book and the previous two movies, he doesn't have the attitude anyhow close to getting wild hair. No Atreyu, of course, which was probably one of the worst decisions made in the making of the movie. According to the first movie, Mr. Koreander doesn't like kids. But now he's school librarian, which doesn't make sense. Engywook and Urgl returning was probably a good decision, but their characterization was ruined when they were reduced to complaining about having to go to the bathroom the whole second half of the movie. The Bark Troll (there were bark trolls in the book) is not supposed to know enough about the human world to mention Vegas and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bastian should not have been allowed to keep Junior at his house. Either Bastian would have said, ""No way! I'm not taking him to my house!"" or Junior would have wrecked his house down. Even the Childlike Empress was reduced to an idiot towards the end of the movie. NES III just doesn't have the feel that The Neverending Story was originally designed to have.Positive notes on NES III: Well, the story was actually okay in my opinion.

2.0,Huge disappointment,"I cannot begin to describe how awful this movie is. I watched the first Neverending Story when I was 7 or 8 or so, it came out in 1984, the year I was born, and I was absolutely fascinated with it. A few years later I had the pleasure of watching the second one, and although not as good as the first one, I have to say it is one of the better movie sequels I have seen (the people who comment on it give it too harsh criticism) It was still as imaginative and beautiful as the first one, and kept all the main characters. I saw the third one in the movie rental part of our grocery store when I was 14, and I got exited. I immediately rented it and brought it home and popped it in our VCR (you remember VCR's don't you?). It was not much longer after that that I was popping it out again. NES3, for lack of a better term,... sucks. The storyline was as unimaginative and vapid as you could hope for, it takes place in the real world, and not(as the title would have you believe)in Fantasia, and I get the feeling that it is because creating a fantasy world was a little out of their budget. This movie has ""low budget"" written all over it. The childlike empress isn't even blond! they get some brunette chick who looks nothing like her to play the role. After the fart jokes and potty humor commenced, I just couldn't take it any longer.

2.0,Easily One of the Worst Sequels Ever Made,"Imagine that you are reading an entertainment magazine like ""Entertainment Weekly"" or ""Rolling Stone"", and you happen to look in the news section where they give you information about a movie that is in production. It is a children's movie distributed by Miramax, who has made dozens of Oscar-winning films over the last 30 years. It has special effects by Cinemagic and the Jim Henson Creature Shop, and Jack Black stars in it. You would want to see it, right? Well, not if it's ""The NeverEnding Story III"".""The NeverEnding Story III"" is disappointing in every sense of the word. It is by far one of the worst sequels ever made, and it does a disservice to the book by Michael Ende and the original 1984 film on which it is based (My review: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088323/usercomments-250).This movie takes characters from the book and creates a new story that is full of plot holes, bad puns, and very little logic whatsoever. It helps very little that none of the cast members from either of the first two movies were involved in this film.This time, Bastian is played by Jason James Richter (""Free Willy"" (1993)). Although Richter looks like a preteen model, he is still harassed by a gang at his new school known as the Nasties (or the Nastys) whose leader is Slip, played by a then-unknown Jack Black.As it turns out, Bastian's new school also happens to be where Coreander, the owner of the book store in the original story, works as a librarian. British actor Freddie Jones plays Coreander in this movie, and fans of the original may be disappointed not to see Thomas Hill reprise his role. I don't blame them.Anyway, Coreander happened to bring the NeverEnding Story with him to this school library. It's a pretty contrived way to bring the book back into the story after the main character has moved away if you ask me.What's even more contrived is when Bastian, hiding from the Nastys, retreats into the world of Fantasia, only to have Slip retrieve the book, realize its powers, and try to destroy the world and Bastian. In the book and the first two movies, the reader had little to no control over how the NeverEnding Story would be told. How the Nastys get control is never explained anywhere in the movie. The NeverEnding Story being an enchanted book is no excuse to cover up such plot holes.When Bastian realizes he has to re-enter the real world to obtain the book and save Fantasia, the movie just gets worse. Even with the Oren (the token worn around the neck that resembles two snakes), Bastian alone can't make it back home. So a number of creatures from Fantasia have to wish with him, and be transported into his world, for him to save Fantasia.Such a subplot wouldn't be so bad if the supporting characters weren't so annoying and intelligence insulting. There's the Rock-Biter's baby boy who talks in annoying ""baby talk"" that real children under 3 don't use as vernacular, an anthropomorphic tree who talks like an old Jewish comedian except not as funny, and two gnomes (Urgl and Engywook, featured in the first movie but played by different actors) who have a tired running joke about needing to use the bathroom.Oh yes, and who could forget Falcor, the luck dragon? In the first two movies, Falcor was a hero to Atreyu and Bastian, and was the voice of reason in many situations. He also had a voice like Walter Cronkite, which made him ever cooler. Here, he not only looks different from the previous two films, but he's whinier and dumber. When, in the real world, he mistakes an airplane for a female luck dragon, I could only hang my head and wonder, ""Why?"".To make matters worse, Bastian can't wish the book back after the Nastys stole it because he can't use the Oren to make wishes in the real world. That plot point is well and good, and makes a setup for a great conflict that adds to the story. Unfortunately, the people who wrote this screenplay forget that plot point and failed to explain why Bastian's stepsister Nicole (Melody Kay) could make wishes when she had possession of the Oren. Any script reviser could point out these plot holes, and it most especially amazes me that filming progressed despite these inconsistencies.It is even more amazing that no one in this movie actually acts poorly. Richter does well in his role, despite his voice obviously cracking and no one noticing. I don't bring that point up to be mean. It's just that the filmmakers could have used his voice changing as a good subplot to explain why he's being picked on. But I digress.The point is that everyone involved in this film just could not save the story having so many inconsistencies. By the end, the story bears no resemblance to Ende's original book at all. The Fantasia creatures are also too annoying, trying too hard to be comic relief and inundating their dialogue with uncharacteristic pop culture references. Case in point: the Rock Biter rides his bike while singing ""Born To Be Wild"" by Steppenwolf. What were these filmmakers thinking?And you would think that the Jim Henson Creature Shop working on your side would be a valuable asset in this film. In this case, none of the recurring characters look like they did in the first two movies (the Rock Biter, looking like a pint-size version of his predecessor, was the biggest disappointment), and they weren't strong characters either. They did not live up to Henson's high standards of storytelling and development. If you don't believe me, try finding this movie on Muppet Central. You would have had better luck finding this film in a theater that ran it for two weeks back when it was released.",easily one worst sequels ever made,imagine that you are reading entertainment magazine like entertainment weekly or rolling stone you happen look news section where they give you information about movie that is production it is childrens movie distributed by miramax who has made dozens oscar winning films over last 30 years it has special effects by cinemagic jim henson creature shop jack black stars it you would want see it right well not if its neverending story iii neverending story iii is disappointing every sense word it is by far one worst sequels ever made it does disservice book by michael ende original 1984 film which it is based my review movie takes characters book creates new story that is full plot holes bad puns very little logic whatsoever it helps very little that none cast members either first two movies were involved this film this time bastian is played by jason james richter free willy 1993 although richter looks like preteen model he is still harassed by gang at his new school known as nasties or nastys whose leader is slip played by then unknown jack black as it turns out bastians new school also happens be where coreander owner book store original story works as librarian british actor freddie jones plays coreander this movie fans original may be disappointed not see thomas hill reprise his role i dont blame them anyway coreander happened bring neverending story with him this school library its pretty contrived way bring book back into story after main character has moved away if you ask me whats even more contrived is when bastian hiding nastys retreats into world fantasia only have slip retrieve book realize its powers try destroy world bastian book first two movies reader had little no control over how neverending story would be told how nastys get control is never explained anywhere movie neverending story being enchanted book is no excuse cover up such plot holes when bastian realizes he has re enter real world obtain book save fantasia movie just gets worse even with oren token worn around neck that resembles two snakes bastian alone cant make it back home so number creatures fantasia have wish with him be transported into his world him save fantasia such subplot wouldnt be so bad if supporting characters werent so annoying intelligence insulting theres rock biters baby boy who talks annoying baby talk that real children under 3 dont use as vernacular anthropomorphic tree who talks like old jewish comedian except not as funny two gnomes urgl engywook featured first movie but played by different actors who have tired running joke about needing use bathroom oh yes who could forget falcor luck dragon first two movies falcor was hero atreyu bastian was voice reason many situations he also had voice like walter cronkite which made him ever cooler here he not only looks different previous two films but hes whinier dumber when real world he mistakes airplane female luck dragon i could only hang my head wonder why make matters worse bastian cant wish book back after nastys stole it because he cant use oren make wishes real world that plot point is well good makes setup great conflict that adds story unfortunately people who wrote this screenplay forget that plot point failed explain why bastians stepsister nicole melody kay could make wishes when she had possession oren any script reviser could point out these plot holes it most especially amazes me that filming progressed despite these inconsistencies it is even more amazing that no one this movie actually acts poorly richter does well his role despite his voice obviously cracking no one noticing i dont bring that point up be mean its just that filmmakers could have used his voice changing as good subplot explain why hes being picked but i digress point is that everyone involved this film just could not save story having so many inconsistencies by end story bears no resemblance endes original book at all fantasia creatures are also too annoying trying too hard be comic relief inundating their dialogue with uncharacteristic pop culture references case point rock biter rides his bike while singing born be wild by steppenwolf what were these filmmakers thinking you would think that jim henson creature shop working your side would be valuable asset this film this case none recurring characters look like they did first two movies rock biter looking like pint size version his predecessor was biggest disappointment they werent strong characters either they did not live up hensons high standards storytelling development if you dont believe me try finding this movie muppet central you would have had better luck finding this film theater that ran it two weeks back when it was released,0.5293256654692824,-0.005607096803905294,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.32}"

1.0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"Without surprises, I was expecting this to be very bad. On one hand, I saw no reason to watch this at all. On the other hand, I had nothing to do, so I decided to watch this just to see how bad it would be.My oh my, the many negative comments I read about this movie have all the reason to be. This movie is garbage, capable of making any fan of the original blush of shame. Seriously, I don't get how in the world did this movie lost its place in the IMDb Bottom 100 because that's where it belongs.This terrible film should have never seen the light of the day. What did they think they were doing? This is not even a shadow of the original. Frankly, this is an offense and mockery on the original and a strong one to win a place of ""honor"" at the Razzies, being the worst of the trilogy.If the 2nd one is already quite bad and a huge mess, this one is even worse. It's a movie without reason to exist. Everything is bad in this movie: the crude puppets and sceneries, the very poor plot, all of the characters (especially the more than annoying bullies, the Nasties) and the crappy lines (such as a reference to Arnold Schwarzenneger and Jean Claude Van Damme).But that's far from being all. The bullies here are really nasty and way more annoying than the bullies from the original film. Just as bad as this or even worse is that here the bullies have the power over Fantasia!Plus, what have they done to good old Falkor? Here he is so ugly and has no personality at all. Here he has nothing to do with the beautiful and happy creature from the 1st film we all love so much. And what's the point of putting Falkor flying next to a Lufthansa plane? Other annoying things are, without a doubt, the walking tree that also talks... bah, I hate that kind of thing! The Rockbiter here is slim and small, so much that I didn't realize it was him until the 2nd half of the movie. Here he's got a wife and a son, Junior. Can't describe how annoying is the Rockbiter and his family here. And now they've got a television? My goodness, what a silly nonsense!The soundtrack is a mistake. I mean, the songs themselves are great, such as ""Born to be wild"", ""Crash! Boom! Bang!"", ""Kiss From a Rose"" and ""Games People Play"". But these songs aren't for a fantasy movie. As for Fantasia, as one can (and should) expect, it hasn't got the magic, enchantment and beauty of the original.Jason James Richter, although he was a competent actor, can't be compared to the charismatic Barret Oliver. Once again, the cast is entirely different. None of the characters feel like those of the original at all. They're a joke instead of captivating. Yet there is nothing funny about them or the movie itself. And that thing of Bastian's new family and lifestyle... no comments.The cast, the director and all the artists involved in the 1st movie must have had quite a shock with this joke of a movie. This has nothing to do with their masterpiece. They must have laughed out loud about how ridiculous this movie is...",one worst movies ive ever seen,without surprises i was expecting this be very bad one hand i saw no reason watch this at all other hand i had nothing do so i decided watch this just see how bad it would be my oh my many negative comments i read about this movie have all reason be this movie is garbage capable making any fan original blush shame seriously i dont get how world did this movie lost its place imdb bottom 100 because thats where it belongs this terrible film should have never seen light day what did they think they were doing this is not even shadow original frankly this is offense mockery original strong one win place honor at razzies being worst trilogy if 2nd one is already quite bad huge mess this one is even worse its movie without reason exist everything is bad this movie crude puppets sceneries very poor plot all characters especially more than annoying bullies nasties crappy lines such as reference arnold schwarzenneger jean claude van damme but thats far being all bullies here are really nasty way more annoying than bullies original film just as bad as this or even worse is that here bullies have power over fantasia plus what have they done good old falkor here he is so ugly has no personality at all here he has nothing do with beautiful happy creature 1st film we all love so much whats point putting falkor flying next lufthansa plane other annoying things are without doubt walking tree that also talks bah i hate that kind thing rockbiter here is slim small so much that i didnt realize it was him until 2nd half movie here hes got wife son junior cant describe how annoying is rockbiter his family here now theyve got television my goodness what silly nonsense soundtrack is mistake i mean songs themselves are great such as born be wild crash boom bang kiss rose games people play but these songs arent fantasy movie as fantasia as one can should expect it hasnt got magic enchantment beauty original jason james richter although he was competent actor cant be compared charismatic barret oliver once again cast is entirely different none characters feel like those original at all theyre joke instead captivating yet there is nothing funny about them or movie itself that thing bastians new family lifestyle no comments cast director all artists involved 1st movie must have had quite shock with this joke movie this has nothing do with their masterpiece they must have laughed out loud about how ridiculous this movie is,0.6708509003074219,-0.026538208168642958,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.21}"

1.0,Pales in comparison to the first and even the lackluster sequel.,"This movie is nothing but a slap in the face to fans of the original film. The second movie was bad enough, but at least they tried....this was just stupid. And the sad part is this movie will probably appeal to young kids more than the other two.In this atrocity, Bastian Bux's father gets married and Bastian has a new stepsister who doesn't like him for some reason. He goes to a new school and gets picked on by the group of bullies called the Nasties, led by a young Jack Black. He goes into the Neverending Story to escape the bullies, but they find the book and start changing it in their image. Chaos ensues. One thing I can say about this movie, is it's actually somewhat entertaining at times because of it's stupidity, where the second film was just boring. But nonetheless, this is still the worst of the films. It seems as though the writer and director didn't think to use the other two movies as references on how the characters should look or act. Falcor in the first film is an intelligent heroic creature, here Falcor has a deep, dumb voice and he serves as the stupid coward comic relief, similar to the Cowardly Lion. The Rock Eaters have totally changed what they look like from massive and wide to skinny costumed characters. One of the worst scenes involves the Rock Eater singing ""Born to Be Wild"", which was horrendous. Atreyu, the co-main character of the last 2 films is gone, and everything about Fantasia has changed in this terrible so-called final Neverending Story film.My rating: BOMB/****. 90 mins.

,A poor film on so many levels,"With a new life with his stepmother and stepsister, Bastian Bux has to start another new school and ends up facing yet another set of bullies not won over by his personality. After narrowly getting out of a beating, Bastian escapes the real world back into Fantasia. However he cannot hide the book and, although he is safe in the familiar magical world, the book falls into the hands of the bullies. Despite being older, more cynical teenagers, Slip accepts the concept of a magical world within a book surprisingly easily and decides that he will use the book to change the story he wants to hear and the world of Fantasia is yet again under threat  however this time the people of that world must take the battle into the real world.Having seen the bit in quality between parts one and two already I must admit that I held out limited hopes for part three. Unsurprisingly this film turned out to be stripped of budget, magic, fun and imagination and replaced with a standard story with poor humour delivered by the cheapest bidders. Maybe for budget reasons or maybe just to save the writers having to develop Fantasia any further, the majority of this takes place in the real world. This in itself isn't a big problem but the fact that the script does nothing of value with it is. The story makes big leaps and seems more interested in cheap gags and soap opera dramatics rather than producing a story of magic and excitement which the first film, although not perfect, was (although comparing the first film with the third makes the first look like Citizen Kane). I struggled to care about any of the story and the whole thing was written at the most basic level it could have been.Visually the film looks rubbish. The ""effects"" are at the standard of a television show  certainly the rock creatures look like they were the characters from Dinosaurs spray-painted grey. The low budget can be seen in the mouths where they are basic flaps without any ability to match words, instead they just flap open and closed. Generally this is the standard and everything looks rubbery and basic  contributing even more to the lack of magic. The cast shouldn't really be blamed for any of the mess because they are caught up in the blast. Richter is so-so at best and the rest of the cast are all pretty basic. Black is a strange find but I was grateful for me  he didn't take the p1ss quite as much as I would have liked but he does at least do a watered down version of what would later become his normal routine. The voicework is generally poor, mostly being as cheap as the effects  the only real surprise was to find Tony Robinson in the midst of it all.Overall a poor film that is completely unnecessary. The effects are as poor as the plot which is as poor as the performances. Lacking any magic or excitement this is a truly horrid product that is the last thing I would want to expose my children to  I would want them to have higher standards than this.",poor film so many levels,with new life with his stepmother stepsister bastian bux has start another new school ends up facing yet another set bullies not won over by his personality after narrowly getting out beating bastian escapes real world back into fantasia however he cannot hide book although he is safe familiar magical world book falls into hands bullies despite being older more cynical teenagers slip accepts concept magical world within book surprisingly easily decides that he will use book change story he wants hear world fantasia is yet again under threat however this time people that world must take battle into real world having seen bit quality between parts one two already i must admit that i held out limited hopes part three unsurprisingly this film turned out be stripped budget magic fun imagination replaced with standard story with poor humour delivered by cheapest bidders maybe budget reasons or maybe just save writers having develop fantasia any further majority this takes place real world this itself isnt big problem but fact that script does nothing value with it is story makes big leaps seems more interested cheap gags soap opera dramatics rather than producing story magic excitement which first film although not perfect was although comparing first film with third makes first look like citizen kane i struggled care about any story whole thing was written at most basic level it could have been visually film looks rubbish effects are at standard television show certainly rock creatures look like they were characters dinosaurs spray painted grey low budget can be seen mouths where they are basic flaps without any ability match words instead they just flap open closed generally this is standard everything looks rubbery basic contributing even more lack magic cast shouldnt really be blamed any mess because they are caught up blast richter is so so at best rest cast are all pretty basic black is strange find but i was grateful me he didnt take p1ss quite as much as i would have liked but he does at least do watered down version what would later become his normal routine voicework is generally poor mostly being as cheap as effects only real surprise was find tony robinson midst it all overall poor film that is completely unnecessary effects are as poor as plot which is as poor as performances lacking any magic or excitement this is truly horrid product that is last thing i would want expose my children i would want them have higher standards than this,0.4331679503757426,0.11419950900470377,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"

Yeccchhh.Then, there's the tree-like character. HIS wisecracks are often related to the human world. (""Call the fire department!"") If there's one thing I despise, it's modern-Earth humor where it doesn't belong.And the Child-like Empress. This lovely, polite, wise young lady has been mysteriously transformed into the Pre-Teen Empress. At one point, she even referred to someone as ""old man."" Can you imagine our beloved Stronach-version Empress doing that? Never!The ONLY characters who had anything done right with them were the gnomes. These were actually played fairly well.The story was horrendous. It didn't even feel like a Neverending Story movie at all. It didn't help that most of it took place in the ""human world.""My rating?

2.0,"Oh, god, what a rip off","I gave this one a two, because I actually could stand to see it to the end of it. I give 1 only to what I cannot stand, but I had a dilemma about this movie.What the hell are they doing? I understand that the first movie was made after a book, so the effort of transforming it into a script was minimal, but how could they use less effort to create a new script from scratch I don't quite get.Imagine that the Neverending Story book is stolen by thugs. From here on all the story goes on and on in the human world (no story, no special effects, no effort of imagination) and the damned Free Willy kid uses karate in the end to get the book back. Add to this a scared poodle as a Luck Dragon, something that seemed a parody of a homosexual behaviour as a rock baby, references to the human world from the mouths of all characters, not to mention that all of them, and I mean ALL FANTASIAN CHARACTERS, are there only to move around in silly costumes and say silly things. They are of no consequence to anything.I guess this movie does make a point, though. You kids, better pick up the Neverending Story book from somewhere, read the original written word and skip incredibly idiotic movies as this one.God, horrible! I couldn't believe it when the movie ended that I actually stayed and watched it.

2.0,neverending reputation? Ended!!,"Neverending story 1 was my favourite movie as a kid. But a lot came while growing up and in the process, I confess I completely missed parts 2 and 3. Now I discovered them by chance and was really curious.. OK, part 2 is not bad but failed to impress me as the first one. Part 3, for god sake what a disappointment. Why did they even bother? Why is Rockbiter so small? What happened to Atreyu? even the known characters as Falcor are completely changed (Lucky Dragon? More like ""GRUMPY dragon"" here) Also the book cover is green? What happened to the normal red cover? They TRIED to respect the original story, but they failed. Miserably. As a kid I imagined Fantasia as this wonderful imaginary world, full of dreams and illusion. Thanks to this movie, my image of Fantasia has been reduced to Rockbiter buying an electric guitar and joining a Rock band and also Childlike Empress using Aurin for her shopping sprees. Don't ask, just don't watch it. If you want to keep your childhood memories intact, stay at Neverending story 2. Story ends there anyways, this was completely unnecessary.

1.0,Why was this movie made?,"I was so interested in seeing this movie because it was featured in my favorite review of the Nostalgia Critic ever. It's hard to say that I really suffered while watching this because it's so much fun to learn more about it from the Critic's review. I loved hearing the commentary from them saying it was so bad we should all just make our own reviews and I am now! The basic plot is that Bastian uses the book from the first two movies and is pursued by a group of bullies called the Nasties. I remember watching the second movie and being amazed at how bad it was. I'm so glad the awfulness of this film puts that one to shame.The Critic didn't even mention the fact that the secondary character from the first two movies, Atreyu wasn't in this film for no reason. Okay, the reason was that he didn't to be associated with this horrendous film. We get a lot of characters like the Rockbiter's son, a talking tree, and gnomes and you know what? Every single one of these characters is completely and utterly useless. They only make things worse, make stupid jokes like referencing Arnold Schwarzeneggar and making jokes about barking up the wrong tree. The designs, especially the Rockbiter are terrible and stupid looking.The childlike empress and the people she works with are also completely useless, boring and dumb. She never even explains why Bastian can't just wish everything to go back to normal. The second film at least had purpose in that it adapted the second half of the book, although loosely I heard. Falcor is now an idiot who thinks airplanes and paper dragons are living things as opposed to his wisdom from the first movie. We get toilet jokes and a story that really does seem to have no end. There's sort of a sequel hook but thank God this film was so awful it killed off the franchise forever.

2.0,"I wanted to love it, but I can't even like it.","One of the main reasons this installment tanked is that it depends entirely on the second installment to bear it up. The problem with that is that the second installment was horrendous, so anything at all that depends upon it can not possibly be great. It could be better, but it can't be great.This isn't even better. I don't know if it's because the movie feels and runs like they spent a grand total of twelve minutes in development, or if each and every individual element is inferior (if that's even possible) to the second installment.Either way, it's not worth my time to figure it out, it's just that bad, but if you happened to be among the two or three people who liked the second installment, the third is necessary to fill in the numerous plot holes.It rates a 2.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",i wanted love it but i cant even like it,one main reasons this installment tanked is that it depends entirely second installment bear it up problem with that is that second installment was horrendous so anything at all that depends upon it can not possibly be great it could be better but it cant be great this isnt even better i dont know if its because movie feels runs like they spent grand total twelve minutes development or if each every individual element is inferior if thats even possible second installment either way its not worth my time figure it out its just that bad but if you happened be among two or three people who liked second installment third is necessary fill numerous plot holes it rates 2 4 10 fiend,0.4642857142857143,0.10555555555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.25}"
1.0,The VeryEnding Story,"Firstly, I want to apologize to IMDB. I wrote a review about this film earlier and it was rejected because it was a flat-out rant. It was not a review that was explainable. It was a flat-out rant. Now, that I've apologized. Let's write a REVIEW of this film. Not a rant.So what may confuse most people is the title of the film. It's called ""The NeverEnding Story III: Return to Fantasia"", or ""Escape from Fantasia"" depending on where you live in the world. It really should have been called: ""The NeverEnding Story The Adventures of Bastian Bux the Movie"". Because this movie is basically an adaption of an animated show. Not of the book source material which it should have been based on.Let me just say that there are ideas in this film that sound like they COULD be good. Hear me out, think about this. And this only, what if someone evil was in control of the book ""The NeverEnding Story""? If you think about that alone, that sounds like an interesting concept. Also, if you think, ""What if the creatures from Fantasia got into the real world?"" That sounds great on paper, but not for a movie.The movie just should've been a cartoon. It has musical numbers that could've been fine if it was something like Lion King, but some of them are cringeworthy. Example: Born to be Wild by the Rockbiter! 😖Atreyu is not in this film. Here's the reason why: When he read the script for it, he escaped Fantasia and never came back. That's the reasonable explanation. Also, why are the bullies called the Nasties? They could've been called the Bullies and it would've been better than the nasties. I'm sorry that you had to act in this Jack Black.At least they added the Old Man of the Wandering Mountain, but still. This is a terrible movie. It's amazing how bad they did on this film. It's a disaster! The animontronics are creepy, the villains are annoying, I cannot take Bastian seriously, and the plot needs major work.On the upside, I did love Julie Cox as the Childlike Empress. To me she's the best and prettiest one of all three. I guess it's just because she's British.How I rank the Childlike Empresses:Three: Alexandra Johnes (Did not look like an empress)Two: Tami Stromach (Great role for her, but I like Julie Cox more)One: Julie Cox (The prettiest empress and the most believable).So yeah. Don't ever watch this movie. If you must take something from it. Take the fact that Julie Cox did great. But don't waste any hours of your life or brain cells on this disaster.",veryending story,firstly i want apologize imdb i wrote review about this film earlier it was rejected because it was flat out rant it was not review that was explainable it was flat out rant now that ive apologized lets write review this film not rant so what may confuse most people is title film its called neverending story iii return fantasia or escape fantasia depending where you live world it really should have been called neverending story adventures bastian bux movie because this movie is basically adaption animated show not book source material which it should have been based let me just say that there are ideas this film that sound like they could be good hear me out think about this this only what if someone evil was control book neverending story if you think about that alone that sounds like interesting concept also if you think what if creatures fantasia got into real world that sounds great paper but not movie movie just shouldve been cartoon it has musical numbers that couldve been fine if it was something like lion king but some them are cringeworthy example born be wild by rockbiter atreyu is not this film heres reason why when he read script it he escaped fantasia never came back thats reasonable explanation also why are bullies called nasties they couldve been called bullies it wouldve been better than nasties im sorry that you had act this jack black at least they added old man wandering mountain but still this is terrible movie its amazing how bad they did this film its disaster animontronics are creepy villains are annoying i cannot take bastian seriously plot needs major work upside i did love julie cox as childlike empress me shes best prettiest one all three i guess its just because shes british how i rank childlike empresses three alexandra johnes did not look like empress two tami stromach great role her but i like julie cox more one julie cox prettiest empress most believable so yeah dont ever watch this movie if you must take something it take fact that julie cox did great but dont waste any hours your life or brain cells this disaster,0.5195121951219512,0.0955007390983001,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.23}"
