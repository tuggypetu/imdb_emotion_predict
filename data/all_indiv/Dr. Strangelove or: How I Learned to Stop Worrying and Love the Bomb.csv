10.0,"""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.""","DR. STRANGELOVE.... is a satirical black comedy or rather an ironic approach to decisions and information in the Cold War madness. The smart choice is the mother of all wisdom. It is loosely based on Peter George's novel ""Red Alert"".A crazy American general has ordered, due a bizarre reason, a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. A bit absentminded captain has realized that a general has lost his mind. Meanwhile, a President meets with his top Pentagon advisors, including a passionate super-hawk general, who sees this as an opportunity to do something about Communism in general and Russians in particular. However, the Russians have an ""automatic"" response...This film loses all touch with the reality on the one side, and yet, it directly affects an image of a disturbed political reality on the other side. The irony stems from human stupidity, irresponsibility, suspicion and arrogance. Mr. Kubrick has created a satirical hopeless situation, through a conflict of mentality and a sense of patriotism, after which, a bizarre - moral winner rises. The highlight of satire is that world diplomacy rejects itself on multiple occasions.However, there is a lot of questions. Why give so much power in hands of a few people? One of them, I mean all, are mostly crazy. Why use energy resources to build nuclear weapons? Probably because we do not have better things to do. Is it wise to make fun of a defense system of the strongest force in the world? Of course it is, one day, we have to stop being afraid of each other.That's why this film is a satirical warning in an universal time, because we live in a time of a political satire with very serious consequences.I am thrilled with a fact that this film does not have a trace of cynicism. Of course, there is plenty of satire, sarcasm, irony, perhaps exaggerated caricature, but there is no cynicism. Mr. Kubrick, you're a genius! The characterization is excellent.Peter Sellers (Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove, the wheelchair-using nuclear war expert and former Nazi) is simply awesome as a kind of voice of reason, incompetence and insanity at the same time. It is a strange kind of patriot, savior and avenger.Sterling Hayden (Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper) is a paranoid ultra-nationalist, who shows his madness through a serious facial expression.George C. Scott (General Buck Turgidson) is the personification of chauvinism. He expresses his anger and paranoia of communism in a very comical way.",gentlemen you cant fight here this is war room,dr strangelove is satirical black comedy or rather ironic approach decisions information cold war madness smart choice is mother all wisdom it is loosely based peter georges novel red alert crazy american general has ordered due bizarre reason nuclear attack soviet union bit absentminded captain has realized that general has lost his mind meanwhile president meets with his top pentagon advisors including passionate super hawk general who sees this as opportunity do something about communism general russians particular however russians have automatic response this film loses all touch with reality one side yet it directly affects image disturbed political reality other side irony stems human stupidity irresponsibility suspicion arrogance mr kubrick has created satirical hopeless situation through conflict mentality sense patriotism after which bizarre moral winner rises highlight satire is that world diplomacy rejects itself multiple occasions however there is lot questions why give so much power hands few people one them i mean all are mostly crazy why use energy resources build nuclear weapons probably because we do not have better things do is it wise make fun defense system strongest force world course it is one day we have stop being afraid each other thats why this film is satirical warning universal time because we live time political satire with very serious consequences i am thrilled with fact that this film does not have trace cynicism course there is plenty satire sarcasm irony perhaps exaggerated caricature but there is no cynicism mr kubrick youre genius characterization is excellent peter sellers captain lionel mandrake president merkin muffley dr strangelove wheelchair using nuclear war expert former nazi is simply awesome as kind voice reason incompetence insanity at same time it is strange kind patriot savior avenger sterling hayden brigadier general jack d ripper is paranoid ultra nationalist who shows his madness through serious facial expression george c scott general buck turgidson is personification chauvinism he expresses his anger paranoia communism very comical way,0.49575008325008313,0.04368896255259892,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Sharp and outrageously entertaining,"I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat over-constructed and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr.Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",sharp outrageously entertaining,i never really bought into kubrick hype i mean dont get me wrong i like all his films very much but me they all feel somewhat over constructed lack natural flow then i finally got see dr strangelove wow what terrific pitch black satire this film is so wild mean funny peter sellers gives performance his career unlike any kubricks later works theres sense playfulness here that gives whole movie crazy kind energy im guessing that sellers love improvisation forced kubrick ditch his usual perfectionism certain degree film is all better it sharp outrageously entertaining comedy satire by one most revered directors past century 10 out 10 favorite films masterpieces low budget b movies tv shows reviewed,0.5944745484400656,0.0614696223316913,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,The only movie that makes you laugh at the end of the world.,"This movie is absolutely brilliant! It might not be THE best movie ever made but it certainly is one of the most entertaining and fun movies ever made. It isn't even Kubrick's best but it certainly is perhaps his most accessible and entertaining movie.The movie its story and humor are subtle and perfectly makes fun of the whole Cold War situation in the '60's. With some subtle dialog Kubrick perfectly makes fun of a very serious and relevant topic. I mean, the story of this movie isn't that unlikely and could had actually really happened. As a matter of fact, it could still happen today. It's frightening but thanks to Kubrick's directing the movie never really becomes serious and remains fun, hilarious and entertaining from beginning till end. It is the only movie that makes you laugh at the end of the world.The actors are also what makes this movie fun to watch. Peter Sellers is nothing short of brilliant in the three different roles that he plays; Group Captain (G/C) Lionel Mandrake/President Merkin Muffley/Dr. Strangelove. But also George C. Scott is comically brilliant in this movie as Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and he perhaps plays his very best role. Other actors that stood out were; Slim Pickens and Peter Bull. This movie also marks James Earl Jones his very first appearance in a movie.This is perhaps the most subtle and 'darkest' comedies ever made. Everything about it is shear brilliance and even now 40 years later, it hasn't lost any of its power. The movie still looks like it could had been made a couple of months ago. A movie that will never feel outdated or too 'old fashioned' to watch. In 50 years from now, this movie will be just as good and hilarious, as it is now. Mark my words.The movie is filled with some truly classic long sequences and has countless unforgettable moments and dialog in it. Especially the last sequence, involving Dr Strangelove, is absolutely priceless and unforgettable.Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",only movie that makes you laugh at end world,this movie is absolutely brilliant it might not be best movie ever made but it certainly is one most entertaining fun movies ever made it isnt even kubricks best but it certainly is perhaps his most accessible entertaining movie movie its story humor are subtle perfectly makes fun whole cold war situation 60s with some subtle dialog kubrick perfectly makes fun very serious relevant topic i mean story this movie isnt that unlikely could had actually really happened as matter fact it could still happen today its frightening but thanks kubricks directing movie never really becomes serious remains fun hilarious entertaining beginning till end it is only movie that makes you laugh at end world actors are also what makes this movie fun watch peter sellers is nothing short brilliant three different roles that he plays group captain g c lionel mandrake president merkin muffley dr strangelove but also george c scott is comically brilliant this movie as gen buck turgidson he perhaps plays his very best role other actors that stood out were slim pickens peter bull this movie also marks james earl jones his very first appearance movie this is perhaps most subtle darkest comedies ever made everything about it is shear brilliance even now 40 years later it hasnt lost any its power movie still looks like it could had been made couple months ago movie that will never feel outdated or too old fashioned watch 50 years now this movie will be just as good hilarious as it is now mark my words movie is filled with some truly classic long sequences has countless unforgettable moments dialog it especially last sequence involving dr strangelove is absolutely priceless unforgettable brilliant brilliant brilliant 10 10,0.5847599531615925,0.29903395784543324,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,"Still laughing, long past the end credits...","Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb, so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven't seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick's side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn't overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clichés... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, and very well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick's most well-paced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I'm not too fond of Sellers, but here he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick's other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick's films, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I'll just suggest you see it. Seriously, if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you're going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did, but you'll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can't praise it enough. See it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won't regret it. I know I didn't. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10",still laughing long past end credits,whod have thought that kubrick had such great sense humor i mean most his films there are snippets humor barry lyndon has definite irony but i hadnt expected him be able direct such hilarious thoroughly entertaining comedy i had known while that this was highest rated kubrick film here imdb so naturally i was excited find out if it was really his best film even though i havent seen lolita spartacus eyes wide shut or his first few films shorts he made before his feature even though i thoroughly enjoyed his other films this very well may be his best film made period time where thought nuclear war was terrifying idea that was believed be reasonable fear film takes this idea turns it around makes us laugh at it film was made during cold war which must have taken quite lot guts kubricks side then again he did start out intending make thriller suspense film about subject but ultimately realized that comedy with lighthearted look situation would be better idea so he turned idea impending doom nuclear holocaust into black comedy personally i think he did damn good job it i havent laughed that hard so long at any one time quite while fact i might never have comedy isnt overplayed fact most it is presented dead pan matter fact like type way whats even more hilarious is that better part it is completely accurate no dumb stereotypes no old clich s just logic simple good old fashioned observation plot is excellent very well paced my opinion kubricks most well paced film plot takes off almost immediately moves at great pace throughout film acting is flawless absolutely flawless not something completely unusual kubrick film but still george c scott peter sellers are amazing normally im not too fond sellers but here he was brilliant characters are well written diverse interesting cinematography is great just like kubricks other films this one has some very memorable scenes one which bomb riding sequence has been referenced spoofed huge number times possibly more times than any other sequence kubricks films which is quite impressive dialog is well written well delivered memorable plenty quotable lines i cant really say much more about movie without ruining one or more innumerable great jokes so ill just suggest you see it seriously if you enjoy kubricks sense humor as seen limited his other movies youre going enjoy this film maybe not as much as i did but youll most likely laugh lot i recommend this any fan kubrick black comedies peter sellers or just comedies with dark basic theme watch this i cant praise it enough see it unless you are offended by themes film presents you wont regret it i know i didnt not by long shot hilarious film with provocative plot basic idea 10 10,0.5414325842696629,0.24470304975922946,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,Laughing at Fear,"What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy.

,As funny and as sharp and as relevant as it was almost 40 years ago,"When US General Jack D. Ripper orders wing attack plan R into operation he sets his plane on an irrecoverable bombing run into Russia. Powerless to stop them with the relevant three letter access code the President of America and his advisors plan to warn Russia as best they can to prevent as many of the planes reaching their targets as possible. However when the Russian Ambassador warns of the doomsday machine  a machine that will destroy all life on earth in response to a nuclear attack things become desperate. With one plane making a desperate run to it's target things look bleak.Now well respected as a superb satire on the arms race this is one of my favourite Kubrick films. It is less cold than some of this later work and is genuinely funny without losing it's point. The story focuses on three main areas of the attack  the military base where one crazed man launches the attack, the war room at the pentagon and the plane making the bombing run. All these have comedy inherent in them  although thew war room is by far the best. The story is an satire on the futility and danger of the nuclear deterrent while also scattered with fantastic dialogue. It may not sound funny but trust me  it is.The characters are all great and well done by the cast. Peter Sellers excels in each of his roles and shows his quality. As Mandrake he is funny in a very British way, as The President he has great one sided conversations with his Russian counterpart as well as great dialogue including the legendary `Gentlemen you can't fight in here  this is the war room'. However as Dr Strangelove he is hilarious  the character himself is a swipe at those who change political sides but maybe still hold onto their old ideologies. Sterling Hayden is great as General Ripper  he delivers his madness with a straight face throughout (or maybe no-one told him it was a comedy!). Slim Pickens is good and has the most famous scene from the film that has been copied in many things including Homer's fantasy in The Simpsons. However for me the standout is George C. Scott  not exactly a comedy actor he is frantic and over the top with his communist paranoia.Overall this is a classic and deserves to be. It is sharp today as it was then and even more relevant. The comedy is still fresh and the dialogue is great  quite simply, when Scott implores the president to act quickly as `we must not have a mineshaft gap!' then you've arrived!",as funny as sharp as relevant as it was almost 40 years ago,when us general jack d ripper orders wing attack plan r into operation he sets his plane irrecoverable bombing run into russia powerless stop them with relevant three letter access code president america his advisors plan warn russia as best they can prevent as many planes reaching their targets as possible however when russian ambassador warns doomsday machine machine that will destroy all life earth response nuclear attack things become desperate with one plane making desperate run its target things look bleak now well respected as superb satire arms race this is one my favourite kubrick films it is less cold than some this later work is genuinely funny without losing its point story focuses three main areas attack military base where one crazed man launches attack war room at pentagon plane making bombing run all these have comedy inherent them although thew war room is by far best story is satire futility danger nuclear deterrent while also scattered with fantastic dialogue it may not sound funny but trust me it is characters are all great well done by cast peter sellers excels each his roles shows his quality as mandrake he is funny very british way as president he has great one sided conversations with his russian counterpart as well as great dialogue including legendary gentlemen you cant fight here this is war room however as dr strangelove he is hilarious character himself is swipe at those who change political sides but maybe still hold onto their old ideologies sterling hayden is great as general ripper he delivers his madness with straight face throughout or maybe no one told him it was comedy slim pickens is good has most famous scene film that has been copied many things including homers fantasy simpsons however me standout is george c scott not exactly comedy actor he is frantic over top with his communist paranoia overall this is classic deserves be it is sharp today as it was then even more relevant comedy is still fresh dialogue is great quite simply when scott implores president act quickly as we must not have mineshaft gap then youve arrived,0.5967965367965368,0.2022727272727273,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,"Gentlemen, You can't fight in here! This is the War Room!","I didn't quite understand all of the jokes, but I enjoyed this movie enormously. It is essentially one of the best satirical comedies out there. Peter Sellers was hilarious here in no less than 3 roles. My personal favourite was the president. My favourite line of the film is actually in the title of this review, as Dad and I watched this at midnight and couldn't stop laughing. I loved Sellers also as the man in the wheelchair Strangelove, who tries to impersonate Hitler, I think. There was a brilliant performance from fine actor George C. Scott, who I really admire. I personally think there isn't enough of these two stars on television, I really don't. I noticed a young James Earl Jones too, and the camera-work and direction were both excellent. Got to love the music, I did, a bit ironic, but that was the intention. Great movie! 9/10.

10.0,This gets better with repeated viewings--what a film!,"I saw this film originally when I was about 12 and I wasn't super-impressed by it--particularly since my father was a bit like George C. Scott's character in the film!! However, years later (long after the threat from nuclear annihilation from the Soviet Union has greatly diminished), I was a lot older and experienced and thought the film was brilliant--and not the ""Commie Plot"" my Dad had envisioned!The film features some amazing performances that are absolutely mesmerizing. Sterling Hayden is excellent as the schizophrenic general that orders a first strike on the USSR--he's gruff, weird but pretty believable. However, his performance is unfortunately overshadowed by two other actors. My favorite of these was George C. Scott. Although he didn't need to do the amazing multiple roles that Peter Sellers did (the man was AMAZING), the one character he played was hilarious and chilling. He was the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and you just have to see and hear him to believe him. Although technically NOT schizophrenic like Hayden, he was a totally insane general that actually seemed to look forward to a nuclear war with the ""!@&%@# Ruskies!"". His swagger and bravado was perfectly balanced with all the truly stupid things the character unintentionally said--again and again.Now as for Sellers, he was such a great character actor but all too often, he was remembered more for Inspector Clousseau (a good character, but only one of MANY the man was capable of doing) or he was remembered for all the BAD movies he did in his lifetime. It seems for every great film he made (such as THE MOUSE THAT ROARED or BEING THERE), he also made crap (such as THE PRISONER OF ZENDA or THE FIENDISH PLOT OF FU MANCHU). His lack of discernment tended to hide his brilliance. And, in Dr. Strangelove he was absolutely brilliant--playing three totally different roles. As the British Colonel, he was quite believable and underplayed the role. As the President, he was a little more comical and yet pretty convincing. And, as Dr. Strangelove, he was an over-the-top ex-Nazi (not all that ""ex"" if you ask me) madman. The variety was stunning and almost without precedent--except for a very similar multiple role situation Sellers also played in 1959's THE MOUSE THAT ROARED--another brilliant comedy about nuclear war.In addition to the great acting and writing, I do have to take my hat off to Stanley Kubrick. In past IMDb reviews, I was not particularly kind to several of his ""masterpieces"" (I am one of those who actually disliked 2001, CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON). However, I hope I am intellectually honest enough to view his films individually (PATHS OF GLORY, THE KILLING and SPARTACUS were wonderful).The bottom line is that this is a great film and can be enjoyed by anyone who has a decent handle on world events and history. Unfortunately, for a generation that now is at times obsessed with Paris Hilton and SURVIVOR, I also believe that the film is quickly becoming one that is simply beyond the capacity of many to even comprehend, as they can't even remember the past and have no trouble living that way.",this gets better with repeated viewings what film,i saw this film originally when i was about 12 i wasnt super impressed by it particularly since my father was bit like george c scotts character film however years later long after threat nuclear annihilation soviet union has greatly diminished i was lot older experienced thought film was brilliant not commie plot my dad had envisioned film features some amazing performances that are absolutely mesmerizing sterling hayden is excellent as schizophrenic general that orders first strike ussr hes gruff weird but pretty believable however his performance is unfortunately overshadowed by two other actors my favorite these was george c scott although he didnt need do amazing multiple roles that peter sellers did man was amazing one character he played was hilarious chilling he was chairman joint chief staff you just have see hear him believe him although technically not schizophrenic like hayden he was totally insane general that actually seemed look forward nuclear war with ruskies his swagger bravado was perfectly balanced with all truly stupid things character unintentionally said again again now as sellers he was such great character actor but all too often he was remembered more inspector clousseau good character but only one many man was capable doing or he was remembered all bad movies he did his lifetime it seems every great film he made such as mouse that roared or being there he also made crap such as prisoner zenda or fiendish plot fu manchu his lack discernment tended hide his brilliance dr strangelove he was absolutely brilliant playing three totally different roles as british colonel he was quite believable underplayed role as president he was little more comical yet pretty convincing as dr strangelove he was over top ex nazi not all that ex if you ask me madman variety was stunning almost without precedent except very similar multiple role situation sellers also played 1959s mouse that roared another brilliant comedy about nuclear war addition great acting writing i do have take my hat off stanley kubrick past imdb reviews i was not particularly kind several his masterpieces i am one those who actually disliked 2001 clockwork orange barry lyndon however i hope i am intellectually honest enough view his films individually paths glory killing spartacus were wonderful bottom line is that this is great film can be enjoyed by anyone who has decent handle world events history unfortunately generation that now is at times obsessed with paris hilton survivor i also believe that film is quickly becoming one that is simply beyond capacity many even comprehend as they cant even remember past have no trouble living that way,0.6370634920634921,0.20673868312757201,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,Kubrick takes a whack at comedy- and the cold war,"Stanley Kubrick always likes to try something new with each movie he does, and this proves it. This is truly one of the grittiest, and best dark comedies I've ever seen with some crude moments and some odd ones (who'd think to have Slim Pickens riding a bomb on it's way down). It turns into a flat out masterpiece though with the spectacular acting by Peter Sellers (in three separate roles), George C. Scott (his facial expressions are a crack up every time), and a supporting cast of crazies in a government of loons, the most impressive of these being the incomparable Sterling Hayden in his best dramatic/funny role. It contains a resonance as well that sticks till today, as corruption and pig-headedness rules in all sorts of governments, but most of all in those with the most power. It's almost worth it just for the opening credits and end sequence with ""we'll meet again"".",kubrick takes whack at comedy cold war,stanley kubrick always likes try something new with each movie he does this proves it this is truly one grittiest best dark comedies ive ever seen with some crude moments some odd ones whod think have slim pickens riding bomb its way down it turns into flat out masterpiece though with spectacular acting by peter sellers three separate roles george c scott his facial expressions are crack up every time supporting cast crazies government loons most impressive these being incomparable sterling hayden his best dramatic funny role it contains resonance as well that sticks till today as corruption pig headedness rules all sorts governments but most all those with most power its almost worth it just opening credits end sequence with well meet again,0.4576561065197428,0.20480945821854915,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Russians In The War Room,"Spectacular and chilling to watch Dr. Strangelove in May 16, 2017. I'm not going to talk about prophecy not even coincidence. Art has a way to warn, express or simply entertain in a way that its relevance will always be renewed. That opening with George C Scott's secretary, in her underwear, answering the phone for her boss in the most professional tone imaginable, is a masterful way to introduce us to the normal absurdity we're about to embark on. Terry Southern's extraordinary script (sharing credit with Peter George and Stanley Kubrick himself) is a masterpiece of intention and execution. The film doesn't have a moment of emptiness nor a single cheap shot. Everything works with the irrational logic of tradition and set standards.

10.0,A must see !!! ***** out of ****,"Who else than Stanley Kubrick could take a serious subject like the cold war and tell the story like a comedy ??? He proves his genius in this film more like in any other film of his. It's the story about one general ( with the very appropriate name Jack D. Ripper) gone mad and he launches an attack on Russia all by himself. He's mad, but still smart enough to prevent that anyone can stop him. He's got this strange ( but very funny ) theories about body-fluids, but his men respect him and do everything he says. So 34 fully-armed plains are sent to as many targets. Meanwhile his Colonel, Mandrake, tries to talk sense to him and the president and another General are trying to warn the Russian prime minister. You can have nothing but great respect for Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film and every single one of them is flawless. The doctor Strangelove character is hilarious and creepy at the same time. His appearances as the doctor are, along with the telephone conversations between the president and the Russian Prime minister the funniest moments in the film... Also the classic bomb-ride of Major Kong off course. George C. Scott is clearly having fun in his role and the debut of James Earl Jones is also definitely worth mentioning.

,"Truly, an incredible and innovative movie","Stanley Kubrick's first and only comedic masterpiece is still the finest ever made. I love everything in the movie: the brilliant acting, sensational script, flawless direction, and even those quirky visual effects. Not only was this film hilarious, it was a breakthrough for the entire film industry when first released. In addition to it's amazing satirical basis, the film also played a major role in how films were advertised and marketed... as if Peter Seller's performance wasn't enough! The sets were also very convincing and just plain great! So realistic in fact, that the FBI almost investigated how they got the B-52 Bomber replicated to near perfection!In the end, 'Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is the best comedy.

9.0,Going Toe to Toe with the 'Rooskies',"As a film Dr. Strangelove was so well received that a more serious film on the same topic, Failsafe, failed to find an audience. Yet Strangelove made you think as well as entertain which is the ultimate object of any great work of cinema.General Jack D. Ripper has sent out the Strategic Air Command bombers and locked down Burpelson Air Force Base so that higher ups can't interfere. He's struck back at the dirty Communists for pushing fluoridation of the water supply which he feels has interfered with his bodily functions.Ripper might want to have checked with the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Buck Turgidson who when we meet him seems to have all his bodily functions working just fine. A second opinion on Ripper's lack of bodily functions might have revised his reason on why his particular functions weren't doing well.Of course his actions have created a crisis and President Muffley of the United States is busy trying to talk to Premier Kissoff of the USSR to prevent a nuclear war. That is in case those SAC bombers can't be recalled. One of the bombers commanded by Major Kong is anxious to do battle with the 'Rooskies'.Director Stanley Kubrick went poaching on the black comedy normally that would be the province of Billy Wilder. But even Wilder in his wildest dreams never used those wonderful Dickensian names for his characters that Kubrick is so delighting in. My favorite however is the part played by Keenan Wynn as the army colonel commanding the tactical force that liberates Burpelson, Colonel Bat Guano.Jack D. Ripper is played by Sterling Hayden a man consumed by his lack of bodily functions. This is a takeoff on Army General Edwin Walker who commanded US troops in Germany and was relieved when it was discovered he was indoctrinating his troops with John Birch Society propaganda which included their fears about fluoridation of water. Curiously enough that cause was actually taken up by other than fanatic right-wingers, people like Ralph Nader. Could Ripper have been right after all?George C. Scott is cigar chomping, bodily functioning spoof of legendary SAC commander Curtis LeMay. He's having quite the difficult time in deciding just who to root for in this crisis.Peter Sellers got an Oscar nomination for playing three different characters in Dr. Strangelove. Sellers is President Muttley, Colonel Mandrake of the RAF an exchange officer serving under Sterling Hayden and the crazed former Nazi nuclear scientist Dr. Strangelove. Watching the film, it's almost hard to believe this is the same man using three different voices and appearances that makeup alone could not explain. Sellers lost to his fellow British player Rex Harrison for My Fair Lady.In fact Dr. Strangelove also lost as Best Picture to My Fair Lady. Of course George Bernard Shaw never put his legendary wit to the issue of mutual nuclear annihilation. Neither did Billy Wilder, but I have a feeling those two talents together couldn't have done any better than Stanley Kubrick.The image that stays in your mind from the film I guarantee will be Slim Pickens as Major Kong riding that hydrogen bomb down to its 'Rooskie' target like a bucking bronco.Hopefully we won't meet Major Kong again, who knows where and who knows when.",going toe toe with rooskies,as film dr strangelove was so well received that more serious film same topic failsafe failed find audience yet strangelove made you think as well as entertain which is ultimate object any great work cinema general jack d ripper has sent out strategic air command bombers locked down burpelson air force base so that higher ups cant interfere hes struck back at dirty communists pushing fluoridation water supply which he feels has interfered with his bodily functions ripper might want have checked with air force chief staff general buck turgidson who when we meet him seems have all his bodily functions working just fine second opinion rippers lack bodily functions might have revised his reason why his particular functions werent doing well course his actions have created crisis president muffley united states is busy trying talk premier kissoff ussr prevent nuclear war that is case those sac bombers cant be recalled one bombers commanded by major kong is anxious do battle with rooskies director stanley kubrick went poaching black comedy normally that would be province billy wilder but even wilder his wildest dreams never used those wonderful dickensian names his characters that kubrick is so delighting my favorite however is part played by keenan wynn as army colonel commanding tactical force that liberates burpelson colonel bat guano jack d ripper is played by sterling hayden man consumed by his lack bodily functions this is takeoff army general edwin walker who commanded us troops germany was relieved when it was discovered he was indoctrinating his troops with john birch society propaganda which included their fears about fluoridation water curiously enough that cause was actually taken up by other than fanatic right wingers people like ralph nader could ripper have been right after all george c scott is cigar chomping bodily functioning spoof legendary sac commander curtis lemay hes having quite difficult time deciding just who root this crisis peter sellers got oscar nomination playing three different characters dr strangelove sellers is president muttley colonel mandrake raf exchange officer serving under sterling hayden crazed former nazi nuclear scientist dr strangelove watching film its almost hard believe this is same man using three different voices appearances that makeup alone could not explain sellers lost his fellow british player rex harrison my fair lady fact dr strangelove also lost as best picture my fair lady course george bernard shaw never put his legendary wit issue mutual nuclear annihilation neither did billy wilder but i have feeling those two talents together couldnt have done any better than stanley kubrick image that stays your mind film i guarantee will be slim pickens as major kong riding that hydrogen bomb down its rooskie target like bucking bronco hopefully we wont meet major kong again who knows where who knows when,0.4820604971548368,0.10027328541479484,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"

Beyond that, it's not very dramatic or suspenseful. There's not much depth or intellect. I laughed modestly a few times, but mostly, the humor consists of lazy military stereotypes. The premise was interesting. I could've done with less cockpit and gun firing scenes. Perhaps the general and his descent into madness could've used more fleshing out. I don't know.

,Ethnic cleansing,"Stanley Kubrick directs ""Dr Strangelove."" The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the ""purity of his essence"" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates ""Attack Plan R"", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a ""doomsday device"". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.Ripper, like most of the film's characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that ""the enemy"" is sapping his ""sexual essence"". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not ""masculine"" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.Enter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper's sneak attack. The ball's already rolling, he says, so let's roll along with it. Buck's name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).But once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He's President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to ""work with the enemy"". ""Merkin"" and ""muff"" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.On the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft's radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick's films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.The recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for ""Purity of Essence"" and ""Peace on Earth"", the code points to both party's fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated. When Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the ""doomsday device"", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it's precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.Before the film's iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps ""necessary"" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to ""fuhrers"" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the ""newly risen"" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.With ""Strangelove"" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout. The great black joke of ""Strangelove"" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film's entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a ""mating-warring association"" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like ""f*** you up"" and ""get some action"" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.The film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick's camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film's second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary ""ticking clock"" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film's (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.10/10 - Masterpiece.",ethnic cleansing,stanley kubrick directs dr strangelove plot general ripper manic us general orders nuclear attack russia he

9.0,Superlative.,"The best black comedy ever made. I could watch it a thousand times and still laugh. Oh -- dated, sure. There no longer is a Soviet Union, although there are plenty of people willing to barbecue one another nuclearly -- as in India and Pakistan. I'd like to mention the writer on this, the late Terry Southern, who had lots of input into some pretty funny movies, not to mention his short stories or novellas. He's the guy who came up with ""pre-version."" Kubrik did a fine job. He lost his sense of humor afterward. The acting couldn't be better. George C. Scott embeds himself in one's brain as the general. And Peter Sellers. ""Look, Mein Fuhrer -- I can VALK!"" They wanted him to play King Kong, the pilot, but it didn't work out. Doesn't matter. It's hard to imagine how he would have improved upon Slim Pickens. ""Two pairs a nylon stockin's. Two pair a prophylactics. Shoot. A fella could have a good time on this in Vegas."" Sterling Hayden as the mad general gives his best performance ever, even managing to inject a note of pathos into his delusions. For what it's worth, the final target they attack, ""the missile complex at Laputa"", comes from Swift's satire, ""Gulliver's Travels,"" in which Laputa is the name of a flying island.After the Doomsday Device has gone off and begun to irradiate the entire globe, Sellers, as Dr. Strangelove, opines that it might be possible for selected humans to survive in the deepest of mine shafts. I wanted to make some reference to a Mine Shaft Gesellschaft but couldn't figure out an easy way to fit it in. So I'm shoe-horning it in here. Not that it makes much difference because so few will twig. The final scenes. Credits roll. Atomic blast follows atomic blast whilst Vera sings ""Keep Smiling."" DO NOT MISS THIS ONE.

10.0,Better laugh at absurdity than cry,"This film has become a cultish film because of the subject of course but especially because of the tone that is really entirely conveyed by two actors, Peter Sellers and his three roles and George C. Scott. We could add Slim Pickens in the batch with his phenomenal dive into nuclear annihilation at the end. The subject is central in our post WW2 world since it has to do with nuclear weapons and war. These weapons have only been used once, in fact twice, by the USA against Japan in 1945. The deterring effect of the possession of such weapons is supposed to keep the world as peaceful as it can be, though we all know it is not exactly true since wars have been going on practically constantly since 1945, for oil, for uranium, for who knows what other resources or tribal heritage from the centuries of slavery imposed onto black Africa, or the centuries of rife between sects in some religions. But they were always limited geographically. Most of these wars, apart from the direct colonial wars of Great Britain (not so many) and France (essentially two in Indochina and in Algeria) were the deeds of the USA: Korea, Vietnam, and the Middle East, and should I not mention Granada and Panama? The Soviet Union only had one in Afghanistan and they stepped out of it in front of the resistance from the Taliban and the Mujahedeen, armed and financed by the USA and the CIA. These movements gave rise to Al Qaeda and later ISIS. In 1964 just after the missile crisis in Cuba the world had just gone through a terrible scare and Stanley Kubrick wanted to produce a film that would make the world realize how dangerous these weapons can be and how little we can stop them when they are already in the air. He decided to make it a comedy by using Peter Sellers in three different parts in which his improvising was able to make a real hit on the psyche of an audience. And it is a success and it is still valid.The argument is that there will always be some crazy guy who will be able to bypass all limitations and firewalls to play a trick on the world, on the USSR at the time and Russia nowadays, or even China for the more reckless, and manage a bomb and today a missile to reach the other side and start the ABSOLUTELY AUTOMATIC responding defense that would become a tremendous back-attack or act of final justified but lethal compensation. As the one who started the scare in this film, and the final holocaust, says so well just before committing suicide ""I believe there is another life on the other side!"" That is in the drastic situation the most humorous, a very black humor indeed, remark you can utter.The mad Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove is the most frighteningly hilarious character you can imagine, selling his nuclear knowledge and knowhow to the USA with only one intention: to get to the nuclear holocaust he had been preparing in Germany for Hitler and he was not able to perform or achieve. He is mad, he is deranged, he is physically handicapped, he is erratic and his artificial arm is only remembering his glorious Nazi time and is taking over from time to time to salute his leader, Heil and Heil again. All that is dealt with humorously but it is dramatic and today in the situation of two wars, in Afghanistan on one side, and in Iraq- Syria on the other hand, plus the Korean situation that is poisoned by the unpredictable erratic attitude of President Trump in front of a young leader in North Korea who is either right to resist American imperialism or wrong to endanger the survival of the whole planet, today we can feel it resonate with strength and power. Can there be any reasonable tempered, and well-tempered at that, moderate and realistic compromise to find a solution to the problem without having the USA continuing in their unacceptable track of dictating what one man, one president wants, even when this is purely unethical and absurd? No one in the world, and certainly not any god in existence, has the right to dictate to other countries what they have to do and what norms they have to respect and implement: the one size fits all of the Monroe Doctrine has to be once and for all sent back to the prop-store of an out-of-use theater.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAUTO DIE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, WHAT A JOY! Amazon February 11, 2001Kubrick touches a very sensitive subject in this film, a subject that should remind us of man's supreme ability at destroying himself and surviving his own destruction. He points out how any nuclear protocol has a hole somewhere or a loophole to go around any kind of security precautions. Nuclear weapons are our unredeemable doom. They can only lead to a catastrophe. And humanity is such that it will enjoy destroying itself and then mobilize its intelligence to just survive in order to start again. There is no hope what so ever. Kubrick deals with this subject in a very humorous way but every detail is there to show that the patriotic motivation of any man justifies in his mind any possible crime or just folly. Man is a fool and his foolishness can know no end.

9.0,Please no fighting in the war room,"Stanley Kubrick's wickedly hilarious end-of-the-world black comedy gem about an impending nuclear war caused by human error straddles a fine line between being fiercely funny and genuinely chilling throughout: As evident by the gross behavior and arrogant attitudes of various high-ranking officials in positions of power that they are neither smart nor mature enough to properly handle, the greatest threat to mankind's safety isn't the existence of nuclear weapons; instead it's such all too real and unavoidable human foibles as pride, stupidity, and incompetence that we should all be more worried about.The savagely mocking script by Kubrick, Peter George, and Terry Southern pulls zero punches in its no-holds-barred satirizing of said foibles and offers numerous uproarious moments of inspired dark humor: The meek and ineffectual President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers in one of three bravura performances) informing the drunken Soviet premier over the phone about the nuclear strike, the hysterically loony speech made by unhinged paranoid General Jack D. Ripper (robustly played with snarly aplomb by Sterling Hayden) about preserving his precious bodily fluids, gung-ho redneck bomber pilot Major 'King' Kong (a marvelously spirited portrayal by Slim Pickens) riding a nuclear missile like a bucking bronco on its final drop while whooping it up, and the gloriously insane plan for survival that batty ex-Nazi adviser Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again at his most sublimely deranged) proposes to President Muffley.Moreover, the zestful acting from the first-rate cast keeps this movie humming: Sellers pulls off a terrific troika of impressive and highly distinctive turns as Muffley, Strangelove, and uptight RAF group captain Lionel Mandrake, George C. Scott has a field day as bellicose commie-bashing hawk General 'Buck' Turgidson, Keenan Wynn does his usual sturdy work as the gruff Colonel 'Bat' Guano, Peter Bull likewise excels as the shifty Russian ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, Tracy Reed briefly steams things up as sexy secretary Miss Scott, and James Earl Jones handles himself well in his film debut as the thorough Lieutenant Lothar Zogg. Kudos are also in order for Gilbert Taylor's sharp black and white cinematography and Laurie Johnson's rousing military marching band score.

9.0,Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,"'Gentlemen. You can't fight here this is the war room.'Stanley Kubrick is not someone who immediately comes to mind as a director of an absurdist black comedy. Yet he co-wrote and directed Dr Strangelove at a time the cold war was raging in the real world.General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who sees a communist plot everywhere has flipped his lid. He has executed a plan that allows him to override the American president and launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.In the war room, the hawkish General Turgidson (George C Scott) sees a tactical advantage on a nuclear first strike against the Soviets. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to placate the Russian president in a phone call and prevent an all out nuclear war. Although the conversation is always one sided, we never see the Russian president.Colonel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a British executive officer attached to Ripper tries to stop him but Ripper has gone bat crazy.Finally former Nazi German Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers) now a scientific advisor to President Muffley has an idea to survive in underground mines and eventually repopulate the planet.It is spooky to think that there are several people like Ripper and Turgidson about serving in various governments around the world. Even Dr Strangelove comes across as real, even with his arm trying to do a Nazi salute. Many ex Nazi scientists were employed by foreign governments after the second world war.It is a grim black comedy about paranoia and it works because everyone is playing it straight. Slim Pickens as Major King Kong was not even aware that this was a comedy.George C Scott plays it broad but still makes Turgidson scary and silly at the same time. He gives a great performance, Sellars gives a better one in three different roles.The film has some great lines, wonderful set design such as the iconic war room and well known scenes such as Pickens sitting on a bomb as it is dropped from a plane.",dr strangelove or how i learned stop worrying love bomb,gentlemen you cant fight here this is war room stanley kubrick is not someone who immediately comes mind as director absurdist black comedy yet he co wrote directed dr strangelove at time cold war was raging real world general jack d ripper sterling hayden who sees communist plot everywhere has flipped his lid he has executed plan that allows him override american president launch nuclear attack soviet union war room hawkish general turgidson george c scott sees tactical advantage nuclear first strike against soviets president merkin muffley peter sellers tries placate russian president phone call prevent all out nuclear war although conversation is always one sided we never see russian president colonel mandrake peter sellers british executive officer attached ripper tries stop him but ripper has gone bat crazy finally former nazi german dr strangelove peter sellers now scientific advisor president muffley has idea survive underground mines eventually repopulate planet it is spooky think that there are several people like ripper turgidson about serving various governments around world even dr strangelove comes across as real even with his arm trying do nazi salute many ex nazi scientists were employed by foreign governments after second world war it is grim black comedy about paranoia it works because everyone is playing it straight slim pickens as major king kong was not even aware that this was comedy george c scott plays it broad but still makes turgidson scary silly at same time he gives great performance sellars gives better one three different roles film has some great lines wonderful set design such as iconic war room well known scenes such as pickens sitting bomb as it is dropped plane,0.430448717948718,0.052991452991452984,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"
5.0,"Very funny in parts, but sadly not all of this worked for me","Dr Strangelove is a film that is sitting high up in the IMDb Top 250 films (it's currently sitting at number 49 on the list) and therefore it's clearly a film that is generally loved by the public - the critics also have a strong liking for this film. I personally found this film a little uneven if I'm honest....I think where this film is at its strongest is once we get to The War Room; the scenes within the War Room are easily the funniest and best examples of satire. The phone calls between the US President and the Russian President did have me really laughing and I also liked the interplay between President Muffley and the militant Buck Turgidson and thought their various exchanges were absolute gold. Peter Sellers was fantastic in his three different roles although I must admit he was definitely at his best as the German Weapons Researcher. Sellers clearly had a lot of fun here and his performance(s) in this film do almost make up for some of the more tedious aspects. Likewise, Scott was great in his respective role and Hayden was good as the insane general and gave a real scenery chewing performance - did that cigar ever leave his mouth? I think the funniest part of the film was the scene where Mandrake is trying to get through to the President, but runs out of money and asks a soldier to shoot the Coca Cola machine so that he can get some more money in order to get through to the President. The soldier then utters the line ""If you don't get through to the President, you'll end up in trouble with Coca-Cola"". A very funny exchange and quite unexpected if I'm honest.Where the film falters slightly is in most of the scenes outside the War Room. There were far too many scenes from within the war planes that were quite dull if I'm honest. I can understand the opening plane scene and the closing plane scenes, but the constant cuts from the War Room to the planes just seemed pointless. If there was any humour to be found in the 'plane' scenes then it was clearly lost on me. Unfortunately these dull scenes did drag the film down slightly for me despite the fact that the majority of The War Room scenes were very funny.Dr Strangelove isn't a bad film, but it's a very uneven film that was both very funny and very tedious. Unfortunately the good and the bad pretty much cancel each other out hence the score of 5 out of 10.",very funny parts but sadly not all this worked me,dr strangelove is film that is sitting high up imdb top 250 films its currently sitting at number 49 list therefore its clearly film that is generally loved by public critics also have strong liking this film i personally found this film little uneven if im honest i think where this film is at its strongest is once we get war room scenes within war room are easily funniest best examples satire phone calls between us president russian president did have me really laughing i also liked interplay between president muffley militant buck turgidson thought their various exchanges were absolute gold peter sellers was fantastic his three different roles although i must admit he was definitely at his best as german weapons researcher sellers clearly had lot fun here his performance s this film do almost make up some more tedious aspects likewise scott was great his respective role hayden was good as insane general gave real scenery chewing performance did that cigar ever leave his mouth i think funniest part film was scene where mandrake is trying get through president but runs out money asks soldier shoot coca cola machine so that he can get some more money order get through president soldier then utters line if you dont get through president youll end up trouble with coca cola very funny exchange quite unexpected if im honest where film falters slightly is most scenes outside war room there were far too many scenes within war planes that were quite dull if im honest i can understand opening plane scene closing plane scenes but constant cuts war room planes just seemed pointless if there was any humour be found plane scenes then it was clearly lost me unfortunately these dull scenes did drag film down slightly me despite fact that majority war room scenes were very funny dr strangelove isnt bad film but its very uneven film that was both very funny very tedious unfortunately good bad pretty much cancel each other out hence score 5 out 10,0.555490451388889,0.1312282986111111,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,The Ultimate Black Comedy,"Few films are able to take a deadly serious issue and place it within the context of a broad comedy successfully. Dr. Strangelove does exactly that. Kubrick's masterpiece illustrates in brilliant fashion the idiocy of nuclear war and the idiots who are orchestrating it. What strikes one most however in this cinematic gem are the individual characterisations of Sellers, Scott, Hayden and Pickens. To refer to them as memorable roles is a gross understatement. With names such as President Merkin Muffley, General ""Buck"" Turgidson, General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Other features of the film such as the remarkably designed ""war room"" set, the hand-held camera techniques employed by Kubrick and the black and white cinematography of Gilbert Taylor only add to the power and impact of ""Strangelove.""

9.0,""" Mr. President , . . We Must Not Allow a Mine-Shaft Gap!!! ""","In all the years of film making, Peter Sellers never disappointed an audience. No matter what the part, he always seem to find the perfect voice and therefore, his character. If you put him together with other equally great character actors like, George C. Scott who plays maniacal Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and Sterling Hayden as the insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Jack The Ripper?) and the Slim Pickens as Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong, James Erle Jones as Lt. Lothar Zogg, the bombardier and Peter Bull as the Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, then you not only have an award winning film, but the secret formula for a Classic. The story is set in the sixties, during the Cold War and a lunatic Air Wing Commander intentionally gives the ""Gold Code Signal for his wing to attack Russia. What follows is a dramatic minute ticking film, designed to illuminate the military's ignorance, stupidity and final acquiescence of the doomsday, 'Fail-Safe' device. The entire movie is a comedy of errors and one reflected of Standly Kubrick's genius. The one sequence where Major Kong rides a nuclear missal to its target is synonymous with the mentality of the pentagon.
