10.0,A political film that thrills the viewer with a grain of reality,"Selvaraghavan has managed to picture a movie that careens past the usual reality check in films and perches itself atop a hill. A gargantuan talent that has been latent in Dhanush has been exposed. The veracity and his luminous capability to scintillate his dialogues with authenticity is what implodes the shell that the film initially cocoons itself in. The movie wings itself into a political drama that unflinchingly emanates a feeling of relativity. The movie bludgeons relativity to such boundless extents that by the end of it, the viewer is sure to have a sure shot idea of how politics in India works. Kudos to Selva Raghavan for creating a gangster film that saunters happily past the line designed for success and it is a film not to be deigned with.",political film that thrills viewer with grain reality,selvaraghavan has managed picture movie that careens past usual reality check films perches itself atop hill gargantuan talent that has been latent dhanush has been exposed veracity his luminous capability scintillate his dialogues with authenticity is what implodes shell that film initially cocoons itself movie wings itself into political drama that unflinchingly emanates feeling relativity movie bludgeons relativity such boundless extents that by end it viewer is sure have sure shot idea how politics india works kudos selva raghavan creating gangster film that saunters happily past line designed success it is film not be deigned with,0.3939814814814815,0.024999999999999998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.5}"
8.0,Surely among the Top 5 Best Gangster Films ever made in India. Dhanush and Selvaraguavan both have outdone themselves.,"Pudhu Pettai (2006) : Brief Review -Surely among the Top 5 Best Gangster Films ever made in India. Dhanush and Selvaraguavan both have outdone themselves. When i look back at my list of Best Gangster/Crime dramas, i find Classics like Nayakan, Keeridam, Thalapathi, Spadikam ruling the top spots and then there are many others following the decreasing ratio of quality till 2020. That includes Dhanush's own Vada Chennai too, which, i feel is overrated and looking at Pudhu Pettai it's definitely Overrated! I don't care about others, but this is The Best Gangster Flick i have seen in this millenium. What Bollywood couldn't do in 90s and 00s decade even after making good gangster flicks like Satya and OUTIM, that full proof ""Classic"" tag was missed but Pudhu Pettai has it in 2006 when Gangster flicks were craving for masala elements. After running away from his home teenager Kumar falls in with a gang and slowly rises through the ranks of the Criminal Underworld. His new identity is Kokki Kumar, the Don and wanna be MLA whom everyone fears. You know the basic formula of gangster dramas that no matter how courageous, fearless, reckless the guy is, he must commit a blunder to cause his downfall and with Pudhu Pettai everything is top notch. And it's pleasantly surprisingly because it doesn't look typical. I wanted Kumar to do a blunder and he does exactly at the interval point. That entire idea of two marriages was such a new experience to see in Indian Gangster dramas. And when i wanted him to go through torment, he does and even that part was so intelligently crafted. Performance wise, Dhanush has outdone himself. I'm Speechless. Supporting cast is excellent too. Selavaraghavan does wonders at director's chair with his amazing talent. What a fabulous framework and what a gripping narrative it was. Three hours into crime world and i never felt bored, courtesy team Pudhu Pettai. Overall, an absolute Classic that shouldn't be missed at all.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",surely among top 5 best gangster films ever made india dhanush selvaraguavan both have outdone themselves,pudhu pettai 2006 brief review surely among top 5 best gangster films ever made india dhanush selvaraguavan both have outdone themselves when i look back at my list best gangster crime dramas i find classics like nayakan keeridam thalapathi spadikam ruling top spots then there are many others following decreasing ratio quality till 2020 that includes dhanushs own vada chennai too which i feel is overrated looking at pudhu pettai its definitely overrated i dont care about others but this is best gangster flick i have seen this millenium what bollywood couldnt do 90s 00s decade even after making good gangster flicks like satya outim that full proof classic tag was missed but pudhu pettai has it 2006 when gangster flicks were craving masala elements after running away his home teenager kumar falls with gang slowly rises through ranks criminal underworld his new identity is kokki kumar don wanna be mla whom everyone fears you know basic formula gangster dramas that no matter how courageous fearless reckless guy is he must commit blunder cause his downfall with pudhu pettai everything is top notch its pleasantly surprisingly because it doesnt look typical i wanted kumar do blunder he does exactly at interval point that entire idea two marriages was such new experience see indian gangster dramas when i wanted him go through torment he does even that part was so intelligently crafted performance wise dhanush has outdone himself im speechless supporting cast is excellent too selavaraghavan does wonders at directors chair with his amazing talent what fabulous framework what gripping narrative it was three hours into crime world i never felt bored courtesy team pudhu pettai overall absolute classic that shouldnt be missed at all rating 8 10 by,0.5275883838383838,0.34473484848484837,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.21}"

8.0,Way ahead of its time,"People would say this movie is more of a realistic one but the thing is that there is a bit of poetic expression in many scenes that breaks many stereotypes and are enjoyable. Dhanush rules the screen such that inspite of his body language, the viewer will accept him as a gangster once the script gets the pace. Unlike other gangster flicks where the lead will come up from the slums and all that drug trafficking stuff, this one gets into political world that too in a realistic manner.Technically of a higher class where the cinematography and the use of colour palattes and lights help much in expressing the multiple moods of the film. Music is just out of the world with multiple grooves and much experimental tunes that hit the right chord well.With a world class script and a director like selva, this is a timeless masterpiece that would inspire young filmmakers. One problem is with the excessive bloodshed that would not be appropriate for family audiences.

7.0,Gangster Flick cum Reality Check,"Its gangster flick season in Kollywood. After Thotti Jaya and Pattiyal, Pudhupettai covers the negative side of Tamil Nadu-it's underworld network. This film was released on May 26 2006, and not 2005.Directed by critically-acclaimed director Selvaragavan, Pudhupettai also depicts the harsh reality of the life of an underworld don. Kokki Kumar, the protagonist, leaves home when his father murders his mother and joins the company of a gang of drug-dealers and brothel-runners. His transformation from a scrawny innocent chap to a notorious gang leader is cinematic and clichéd in some ways.The events unfold in periodic flashback from Kokki Kumar's cell. The film contains lots of interesting characters- a prostitute who falls in love with the protagonist, a friend who betrays his leader for the sake of his sister who becomes accidentally married to him, a rival gang leader who never gives up and a string of politicians who will do anything of their own free will. Kokki's almost downfall is narrated well and his fatherhood comes off as a clean and believable sentimental arena.The climax induces some laughter-which comes off as unexpected and thus, not a bad move for the director. Although the film does meet expectations in some ways, it falls short of a few things that arise due to the director's desire to carve the film differently from other typical gangster flicks. I'm surprised the rating was PG-13 in Singapore. It should have been at least NC16. Otherwise, the movie is anticipated to meet critical success. Violence has been making waves in many recent films and Pudhupettai is no exception. Blood is so common in the film that you get used to the sight of red everywhere. However, bloodshed is justified in this film compared to the others.The ending is also handled in a believable manner. This film may very well be based on a true story. Reality bites, especially in the life of a gangster who is a wannabe-politician.Dhanush has obviously worked his heart out for the movie. Yet, he seems to overact in a few scenes that makes us wonder is his character is slightly insane. Of the 2 heroines, I found the Sonia Agarwal character more interesting though the prostitute character gets the more accolades. Yuvan Shanker Raja has 2 catchy numbers-Pul Pesum and Vaariya. The theme music is quite familiar-survival of the fittest-which also happens to be the tagline of the film. How that tagline is suited to the movie, I have no idea.I really enjoy gangster flicks and can't wait for the next one, titled ""E"" to arrive.",gangster flick cum reality check,its gangster flick season kollywood after thotti jaya pattiyal pudhupettai covers negative side tamil nadu its underworld network this film was released may 26 2006 not 2005 directed by critically acclaimed director selvaragavan pudhupettai also depicts harsh reality life underworld don kokki kumar protagonist leaves home when his father murders his mother joins company gang drug dealers brothel runners his transformation scrawny innocent chap notorious gang leader is cinematic clich d some ways events unfold periodic flashback kokki kumars cell film contains lots interesting characters prostitute who falls love with protagonist friend who betrays his leader sake his sister who becomes accidentally married him rival gang leader who never gives up string politicians who will do anything their own free will kokkis almost downfall is narrated well his fatherhood comes off as clean believable sentimental arena climax induces some laughter which comes off as unexpected thus not bad move director although film does meet expectations some ways it falls short few things that arise due directors desire carve film differently other typical gangster flicks im surprised rating was pg 13 singapore it should have been at least nc16 otherwise movie is anticipated meet critical success violence has been making waves many recent films pudhupettai is no exception blood is so common film that you get used sight red everywhere however bloodshed is justified this film compared others ending is also handled believable manner this film may very well be based true story reality bites especially life gangster who is wannabe politician dhanush has obviously worked his heart out movie yet he seems overact few scenes that makes us wonder is his character is slightly insane 2 heroines i found sonia agarwal character more interesting though prostitute character gets more accolades yuvan shanker raja has 2 catchy numbers pul pesum vaariya theme music is quite familiar survival fittest which also happens be tagline film how that tagline is suited movie i have no idea i really enjoy gangster flicks cant wait next one titled e arrive,0.5301587301587303,0.13154761904761905,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"

9.0,"Fresh, raw and bloody, Pudhupettai is an uncompromising depiction of man's innate animalism","Selvaraghavan has surely tattooed his name in the history of tamil cinema with this trendsetting cult classic. Hands down, Pudhupettai is one of the best gangster films I have ever seen. And when I say that I don't just mean tamil cinema. I mean international cinema. I mean that it competes with classics like Goodfellas, The Departed, Godfather, Once upon a time in America. And the reason is the extreme rawness of the filmmaking. Pudhupettai is a film that you may not like very much the first time you watch it. The acting is stripped down to the bare, grisly most humanly rendered form. The cinematography, the songs, the action scenes all feel a bit too raw, a bit too offbeat. You then watch Pudhupettai a second time, and for some inexplicable experience it is better. A third time, everything seems amazing. The film retains its freshness because of the unique, rugged way in which it is shot. Take Goodfellas for example. It is certainly a brilliant, gritty film. Yet there is still something aesthetic about the way in which the shots are composed. Not in Pudhupettai. The action isnt realistic in a cinematic way. They are realistic in a realistic, but ultra-crass and rugged way.This is mostly due to the fact that that the movie is entirely from the perspective of Kokki Kumar, the protagonist who becomes increasingly paranoid and falls further into insanity and moral deprivation as the film progresses. And so some of the ""strange"" shots make sense. Take the climax for instance where dhanush goes on an insane vengeful rampage, yet the whole sequence happens in a white fog, which is contrasted with the dark red of the blood. The bullet shots create holes in the fog. Yet the fog isn't there just for sake of effect. It symbolises Kokki Kumar's isolation and descent into madness. One thing to notice in the sequence is the lack of dialogue. It is more growls, grunts and snarls, implying that Kokki Kumar is at the height of his bestiality; He puts a bloodstained knife at the throat of a child; he runs ruthlessly towards Moorthy even though his wives form a ring around him; Yet, you see a human touch. He waits as Moorthy accepts his fate and eats for the last time. When Moorthy finally kills himself. Kokki Kumar watches for a second and then confusingly cries and hugs Moorthy. The film starts with Kokki Kumar seeing the bloody corpse of his mother, her eyes staring at him. He sees a very similar image in Moorthy's dead body that he saw in the corpse of his mother.The colour gradient of this film is also brilliant. You see a lot of greens and reds. Green symbolising a strange, silent world Kokki Kumar is not used to, a humanity he has not seen. You see this in the scene where he faces a scarecrow in the middle of a field. There is no sound apart from that of night creatures and insects. Kokki Kumar is flabbergasted. He starts getting delusions of enemies everywhere. The scarecrow is a perfect metaphor of his fear and the way in which it looms over him. The red on the other hand symbolises all the violence and brutality around him.The characterisations in this film are brilliant. Everybody is a survivalistic animal. This is surely one of Dhanush's most raw and human performances. Sneha who has pulled of a brilliant and subdued performance as a prostitute demonstrates this well. She takes money from Dhanush when he offers it. When He leaves her in lust for another woman, she emotionally manipulates him into marrying her as well. Soni agarwal as the victim who is forced into marriage with Dhanush is also great. You see her anger. Her bitterness. Her vengeance. Others who are great are Bala singh, Azhagam Perumal as a ruthless, manipulative politician, and the character who plays Mani. The film also features Vijay Sethupathis debut as a henchman which is soundly played.Another great thing about this film is the dialogues. The dialogues are extremely powerful and extremely meaninfgul. Take the scene where Kokki Kumar in prison gives a monlogue on how it feels like after one has killed someone for the first time. Or the one where Kokki Kumar talks to his baby before leaving it. Or even the transformation scene where he is mercilessly thrashed and says ""adinga da, vaanga da adinga da, vazhikala da, ulla eriyuthu da"". (hit me, come on hit me, It's not paining, I'm burning inside). he is in no pain physically yet emotionally he is burning for all the blows society has dealt him with.One of the key factors that elevated Pudhupettai from a great film to an amazing film is Yuvan Shankar Raja's soundtrack. Speechless.Progressie, experimental and unheard of, the album is completely unique and is raw in the same way the film is.Overall, Pudhupettai is a very underrated masterpiece that is one of the best films of tamil cinema. Selvaraghavan has given us another gem.",fresh raw bloody pudhupettai is uncompromising depiction mans innate animalism,selvaraghavan has surely tattooed his name history tamil cinema with this trendsetting cult classic hands down pudhupettai is one best gangster films i have ever seen when i say that i dont just mean tamil cinema i mean international cinema i mean that it competes with classics like goodfellas departed godfather once upon time america reason is extreme rawness filmmaking pudhupettai is film that you may not like very much first time you watch it acting is stripped down bare grisly most humanly rendered form cinematography songs action scenes all feel bit too raw bit too offbeat you then watch pudhupettai second time some inexplicable experience it is better third time everything seems amazing film retains its freshness because unique rugged way which it is shot take goodfellas example it is certainly brilliant gritty film yet there is still something aesthetic about way which shots are composed not pudhupettai action isnt realistic cinematic way they are realistic realistic but ultra crass rugged way this is mostly due fact that that movie is entirely perspective kokki kumar protagonist who becomes increasingly paranoid falls further into insanity moral deprivation as film progresses so some strange shots make sense take climax instance where dhanush goes insane vengeful rampage yet whole sequence happens white fog which is contrasted with dark red blood bullet shots create holes fog yet fog isnt there just sake effect it symbolises kokki kumars isolation descent into madness one thing notice sequence is lack dialogue it is more growls grunts snarls implying that kokki kumar is at height his bestiality he puts bloodstained knife at throat child he runs ruthlessly towards moorthy even though his wives form ring around him yet you see human touch he waits as moorthy accepts his fate eats last time when moorthy finally kills himself kokki kumar watches second then confusingly cries hugs moorthy film starts with kokki kumar seeing bloody corpse his mother her eyes staring at him he sees very similar image moorthys dead body that he saw corpse his mother colour gradient this film is also brilliant you see lot greens reds green symbolising strange silent world kokki kumar is not used humanity he has not seen you see this scene where he faces scarecrow middle field there is no sound apart that night creatures insects kokki kumar is flabbergasted he starts getting delusions enemies everywhere scarecrow is perfect metaphor his fear way which it looms over him red other hand symbolises all violence brutality around him characterisations this film are brilliant everybody is survivalistic animal this is surely one dhanushs most raw human performances sneha who has pulled brilliant subdued performance as prostitute demonstrates this well she takes money dhanush when he offers it when he leaves her lust another woman she emotionally manipulates him into marrying her as well soni agarwal as victim who is forced into marriage with dhanush is also great you see her anger her bitterness her vengeance others who are great are bala singh azhagam perumal as ruthless manipulative politician character who plays mani film also features vijay sethupathis debut as henchman which is soundly played another great thing about this film is dialogues dialogues are extremely powerful extremely meaninfgul take scene where kokki kumar prison gives monlogue how it feels like after one has killed someone first time or one where kokki kumar talks his baby before leaving it or even transformation scene where he is mercilessly thrashed says adinga da vaanga da adinga da vazhikala da ulla eriyuthu da hit me come hit me its not paining im burning inside he is no pain physically yet emotionally he is burning all blows society has dealt him with one key factors that elevated pudhupettai great film amazing film is yuvan shankar rajas soundtrack speechless progressie experimental unheard album is completely unique is raw same way film is overall pudhupettai is very underrated masterpiece that is one best films tamil cinema selvaraghavan has given us another gem,0.47502130458316016,0.058453387963697236,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"

The movie, though wasn't much celebrated at the time of its release, instantly became a cult classic, a few months after. The movie is like a poetry in motion, even though some cinematic liberties are taken in few scenes, the overall feel is so realistic and hard hitting. Right from being a naive adolescent to becoming a ruthless gangster, Dhanush simply rocks every frame he is in, which is literally every frame:-) The supporting actors are all very believable and they did a great job as well.

It was simply superb, the credit goes to the cameraman,Arvind Krishna, for making each frame of the film look brilliant. I heard the film was shot in Super 35mm format and that it was the first time that a Tamil film has been shot in that format. Well the end product was mind blowing. The film opens with a bang and the pace is maintained till the end of the first half. The second half lacks in pace though it keeps you occupied. Another good thing about the movie is the editing. The film has been superbly edited and the special effects team deserves a pat in the back for their great work.Music by Yuvan Shankar Raja is another bonus for this film, be it the background score or the songs. After 3 hits in a row for writer cum directer K. Selvaraghavan this is going to be another feather in the cap.

10.0,A Masterpiece!!,"Rebellious Director Selvaragavan comes up with a movie which is to be remembered for another century in south Indian film industry.""Pudhu Pettai"" follows the journey of Kokki Kumar from his troubled adolescence to becoming a prime-time Gangster.The Movie is ground to reality mostly throughout,except for some cinematic exaggerations at places which is reasonable and convincing for the establishment and arc of the lead character.The director is to be appreciated for his raw,savage take on the tone of the story, for the scenes are bold enough to take us into the journey of the lead character.The screenplay speaks for itself, for events keep unfolding every three minutes of the movie and cruises through to Fade Out.The song montages are cleverly used, which is to be seen in the movie and not discussed in this review.Cinematography by Arvind Krishna and Editing by Kola Baskar are far ahead of times(at least in the period the movie released) and the visuals and the pace of the movie speaks for it. Vfx is cleverly used for some scenes to amplify the mood of the scene.The Music of the film needs special recognition.The songs and the background scores both gel with the movie and are a milestone for Yuvan Shankar Raja in its own merit.The Sound Design of the movie also worth recognition.The cast of the film do all the honors to take the script into the cinema medium successfully and they do it in great style and charisma.The lead Dhanush gives an Epic performance of his lifetime.Be it action,arrogance,sentiment,etc.Dhanush pulls it off in great style and perfection.Hats off!! The others Sneha,Soniya Agarwal,Azhagam Perumal,Bala Singh and every face that appeared in the movie is handled well by the director and they become a part of the story so perfectly, we never feel anything alien about them.The film has blood,gore,violence,sex,profanity and many more, but all for good reasons and the director convinces us for his bold vision, that we are never gonna accuse him.To conclude, Pudhu Pettai is a Must-watch and a rare gangster film of south of India to be cherished forever for its nativity,characters,events,morals and for its genius.",masterpiece,rebellious director selvaragavan comes up with movie which is be remembered another century south indian film industry pudhu pettai follows journey kokki kumar his troubled adolescence becoming prime time gangster movie is ground reality mostly throughout except some cinematic exaggerations at places which is reasonable convincing establishment arc lead character director is be appreciated his raw savage take tone story scenes are bold enough take us into journey lead character screenplay speaks itself events keep unfolding every three minutes movie cruises through fade out song montages are cleverly used which is be seen movie not discussed this review cinematography by arvind krishna editing by kola baskar are far ahead times at least period movie released visuals pace movie speaks it vfx is cleverly used some scenes amplify mood scene music film needs special recognition songs background scores both gel with movie are milestone yuvan shankar raja its own merit sound design movie also worth recognition cast film do all honors take script into cinema medium successfully they do it great style charisma lead dhanush gives epic performance his lifetime be it action arrogance sentiment etc dhanush pulls it off great style perfection hats off others sneha soniya agarwal azhagam perumal bala singh every face that appeared movie is handled well by director they become part story so perfectly we never feel anything alien about them film has blood gore violence sex profanity many more but all good reasons director convinces us his bold vision that we are never gonna accuse him conclude pudhu pettai is must watch rare gangster film south india be cherished forever its nativity characters events morals its genius,0.6294322344322345,0.24587912087912084,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.39}"
