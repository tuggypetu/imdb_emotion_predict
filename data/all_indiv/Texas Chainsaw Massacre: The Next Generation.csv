7.0,A (very) guilty pleasure......,"Ok look I know it's bad, I do. I'm not saying that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is a great film. All I'm saying is that it's a guilty pleasure of mine... like I had a lot of fun here! To me, this is just one of those films where you know it's bad while you're watching it, but you're just never bored and you're having fun. You got two leads who were very young at the time, who would later become Oscar winning A list actors.... that's pretty shocking to see in a film like this lol. I loved Renee Zellweger here, I actually think she and Matthew are the only good actors here, the rest are pretty laughable. But ya know this film really doesn't take itself very seriously at all, so it's fun to laugh at the atrocious acting, mainly given by the actress that plays Heather. Matthew McConaughey is absolutely bonkers here, like sometimes he's just crazy to be crazy. That's one of the many reasons this film is never boring... it's entertaining as hell to watch Matthew play this crazy over the top character. I had fun with the chainsaw chase scenes and actually did get kinda tense while Leatherface was chasing Jenny. I have absolutely no clue why Leatherface is a transvestite in this film, that's just one of the weird things they put in here, like the mechanical leg and the weird government thing. But overall, I think this film knows what it is and it just goes completely off the rails crazy. It's a guilty pleasure for me, I'm not saying this film is good, but I can't deny that I did have fun watching it.",very guilty pleasure,ok look i know its bad i do im not saying that texas chainsaw massacre next generation is great film all im saying is that its guilty pleasure mine like i had lot fun here me this is just one those films where you know its bad while youre watching it but youre just never bored youre having fun you got two leads who were very young at time who would later become oscar winning list actors thats pretty shocking see film like this lol i loved renee zellweger here i actually think she matthew are only good actors here rest are pretty laughable but ya know this film really doesnt take itself very seriously at all so its fun laugh at atrocious acting mainly given by actress that plays heather matthew mcconaughey is absolutely bonkers here like sometimes hes just crazy be crazy thats one many reasons this film is never boring its entertaining as hell watch matthew play this crazy over top character i had fun with chainsaw chase scenes actually did get kinda tense while leatherface was chasing jenny i have absolutely no clue why leatherface is transvestite this film thats just one weird things they put here like mechanical leg weird government thing but overall i think this film knows what it is it just goes completely off rails crazy its guilty pleasure me im not saying this film is good but i cant deny that i did have fun watching it,0.6174149659863943,0.01081632653061225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.24}"
3.0,"""It's been an abomination. You really must accept my sincere apologies.""","Well said, Rothman. Whatever this movie is supposed to be, it fails on every level. It's not scary, it's not disturbing, it's not entertaining, it's only funny periodically when you can't believe how stupid it is, and it essentially killed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise until it was rebooted a decade later. The only reason anyone would have any inclination to watch this is because of its leads - Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey - who were young and naive back then, but they did they best they could with the material they had. Renee played a fine damsel in distress and McConaughey was perfect as an insane cannibalistic psychopath. You can tell he was having fun with the part, and the fun he has is contagious sometimes especially knowing how huge he has become since. The movie itself is downright horrendous. It starts off as a typical slasher: a few teens leaving prom get stranded in the woods, then they encounter strange characters, and from then it devolves into a nonsensical screaming battle between everyone. Literally there are scenes in this movie where the only lines are ""AHHHH!"" Leatherface has gone full transvestite for this installment. They also end the movie with some sort of conspiracy that these cannibals have been around for thousands of years and there are men in suits that check up on them or something. It makes absolutely no sense and trying to piece it together will ensure a loss of brain cells.This is the worst of the pre-millennial TCMs by a long shot. Only watch if you're a die-hard TCM completist or you want to watch McConaughey yell like crazy for a while. Either way, you're bound to be disappointed.",its been abomination you really must accept my sincere apologies,well said rothman whatever this movie is supposed be it fails every level its not scary its not disturbing its not entertaining its only funny periodically when you cant believe how stupid it is it essentially killed texas chainsaw massacre franchise until it was rebooted decade later only reason anyone would have any inclination watch this is because its leads renee zellweger matthew mcconaughey who were young naive back then but they did they best they could with material they had renee played fine damsel distress mcconaughey was perfect as insane cannibalistic psychopath you can tell he was having fun with part fun he has is contagious sometimes especially knowing how huge he has become since movie itself is downright horrendous it starts off as typical slasher few teens leaving prom get stranded woods then they encounter strange characters then it devolves into nonsensical screaming battle between everyone literally there are scenes this movie where only lines are ahhhh leatherface has gone full transvestite this installment they also end movie with some sort conspiracy that these cannibals have been around thousands years there are men suits that check up them or something it makes absolutely no sense trying piece it together will ensure loss brain cells this is worst pre millennial tcms by long shot only watch if youre die hard tcm completist or you want watch mcconaughey yell like crazy while either way youre bound be disappointed,0.6226190476190475,-0.026904761904761904,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,Insanely bad!,"I decided to watch the original ""Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE"", TCM 2, LEATHERFACE TCM 3 and TCM 4 in a row. I already seen the two first and I think they're great. But Leatherface and TCM 4 were new to me. Leatherface was extremely flat and boring but TCM 4 was, well, INSANELY BAD. I simply could not believe what I was watching. My jaw was on the floor. Is this a movie? It's a joke, right? I never laughed so much in a very long time. There are simply no words to describe how bizarre, SURREAL, and bad this movie is. Nothing makes sense so there's no point of trying to make sense of it. It's insane. Insanely bad. Insanely funny. Insanely directed. Insanely insulting to the whole series. Insanely watchable AND unwatchable. Yes, it's INSANELY entertaining to the masochist in me, who likes to witness the worst of the worst in movies, and TCM 4 is WRETCHED to the nth degree! It feels like the Hitchhiker from the original TCM directed this ""movie"". I have to admit that as bad as TCM 4 is, at least it's looks and feels more like the TCM world created by Tobe Hooper than the ultra boring and flat looking LEATHERFACE TCM 3.There are so many moments in TCM 4 that have to be seen to be believed. The funniest being the moment when Renee and Matthew are battling over remotes that controls Matthew's piston powered leg (got that?). Or the funny scene of Leatherface (a cross-dresser here) standing behind clueless Heather and playing with her hair. Heather has to be one of the funniest characters I've ever seen. She's played by Lisa Marie Newmyer, who's a bimbo but with a lot of insight. In this ""movie"", Heather is attacked by Leatherface, placed in a freezer. Then she's hung on a hook, and for some unexplained reason, she got off the hook and tried to crawl away from the house only to be brought back to the house, where she lies on the floor, too bored or lazy to runaway. LOL!!! The whole thing is played as a comedy. But the comedy is often so bizarre that it's not really funny. What's also remarkable is that Renee and Matthew do have ""star quality"" and watching these ""stars"" in this insane movie just adds a lot more bizarre, wonky quality to the movie than it really deserved. The whole cast is game but I wonder, what did the director or producers do to have the cast go all out like that? Was it drugs? Was the whole crew and cast on drugs or drunk?!?! Matthew is very good in his role as, well, I don't know, a buff psycho? And Renee goes all out in her role as ""survivor"", running across the forest like an athlete trying to win a medal.After I watched TCM4 for a second time, I've finally realized that it's all flippant parody of the first movie. I've noticed bizarre details, like the sound of crickets during the opening scene inside Jenny's house. The director, who co-wrote the original TCM, didn't take this new foray into the TCM universe seriously for one second. In the end, TCM 4 looked like an amalgamation of 'THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE' and TWIN PEAKS. The director was obviously influenced by the David Lynch TV series. When you look at the movie in this light, it's not the total disaster that everyone says it is BUT the movie still ends up looking pretty bad because of one major weak aspect about it: it's TOTALLY POINTLESS. If there's was a movie that was totally pointless, it's this one. Why basically remake the first movie a la David Lynch? What's next? The Quentin Tarantino version of TCM?Anyway, personally, I prefer TCM 4 over LEATHERFACE TCM 3, which is just plain bad and is the worst movie of this bizarre so-called series. At least TCM 4 is so consciously bad that, even if it's an almost total embarrassment to the two first films, it's actually fun to watch if you're looking for something to laugh at or with, something that's insanely wacky, full of energy and 100% OVER-THE-TOP! As a straightforward film, TCM 4 rates at a big fat ZERO. But as a ""it's so bad it's good movie,"" TCM 4 rates a perfect 10. It's ranks up there along with GLEN OR GLENDA, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, TERROR IN THE JUNGLE, and THE LEGEND OF LYLAH CLARE as the very best of the worst.",insanely bad,i decided watch original texas chainsaw massacre tcm 2 leatherface tcm 3 tcm 4 row i already seen two first i think theyre great but leatherface tcm 4 were new me leatherface was extremely flat boring but tcm 4 was well insanely bad i simply could not believe what i was watching my jaw was floor is this movie its joke right i never laughed so much very long time there are simply no words describe how bizarre surreal bad this movie is nothing makes sense so theres no point trying make sense it its insane insanely bad insanely funny insanely directed insanely insulting whole series insanely watchable unwatchable yes its insanely entertaining masochist me who likes witness worst worst movies tcm 4 is wretched nth degree it feels like hitchhiker original tcm directed this movie i have admit that as bad as tcm 4 is at least its looks feels more like tcm world created by tobe hooper than ultra boring flat looking leatherface tcm 3 there are so many moments tcm 4 that have be seen be believed funniest being moment when renee matthew are battling over remotes that controls matthews piston powered leg got that or funny scene leatherface cross dresser here standing behind clueless heather playing with her hair heather has be one funniest characters ive ever seen shes played by lisa marie newmyer whos bimbo but with lot insight this movie heather is attacked by leatherface placed freezer then shes hung hook some unexplained reason she got off hook tried crawl away house only be brought back house where she lies floor too bored or lazy runaway lol whole thing is played as comedy but comedy is often so bizarre that its not really funny whats also remarkable is that renee matthew do have star quality watching these stars this insane movie just adds lot more bizarre wonky quality movie than it really deserved whole cast is game but i wonder what did director or producers do have cast go all out like that was it drugs was whole crew cast drugs or drunk matthew is very good his role as well i dont know buff psycho renee goes all out her role as survivor running across forest like athlete trying win medal after i watched tcm4 second time ive finally realized that its all flippant parody first movie ive noticed bizarre details like sound crickets during opening scene inside jennys house director who co wrote original tcm didnt take this new foray into tcm universe seriously one second end tcm 4 looked like amalgamation texas chainsaw massacre twin peaks director was obviously influenced by david lynch tv series when you look at movie this light its not total disaster that everyone says it is but movie still ends up looking pretty bad because one major weak aspect about it its totally pointless if theres was movie that was totally pointless its this one why basically remake first movie la david lynch whats next quentin tarantino version tcm anyway personally i prefer tcm 4 over leatherface tcm 3 which is just plain bad is worst movie this bizarre so called series at least tcm 4 is so consciously bad that even if its almost total embarrassment two first films its actually fun watch if youre looking something laugh at or with something thats insanely wacky full energy 100 over top as straightforward film tcm 4 rates at big fat zero but as its so bad its good movie tcm 4 rates perfect 10 its ranks up there along with glen or glenda plan 9 outer space terror jungle legend lylah clare as very best worst,0.591477108749836,-0.03314825746643927,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.26}"

,"""I Don't Understand!""","At one point, a terrorized Jenny screams ""I don't understand!"" And Vilmer replies ""Welcome to the real world."" For me, this sums up everything I like about this movie.The TCM series has -- at the best of times -- been about random violence...usually for the sake of sensationalism. But underneath it all is the creepy realization that not everybody thinks like you do. Some of them do things which make no sense to you. When you step into their reality, you're at their mercy, and you'll never understand exactly why.This installment plays the ""why?"" theme to the hilt, eventually copping out somewhat near the end when they should have just left us wondering. Darla is wonderful as Vilmer's girlfriend, alternately getting hung up about seemingly trivial things -- having a quiet dinner for a change -- and goading Vilmer into continuing their twisted, mutually abusive relationship. Vilmer himself has fantastic moments, though none of the actors quite live up to Perensky & Zellweger's standards of convincing nuttiness and terror, respectively. Though Newmyer is also great in a role which is too small.Outside of the mayhem, there's some wonderful dialogue, especially the first few lines in the movie: the teacher who simpers around the students and then gripes, ""f*** I hate kids."" Heather's friend with the absolutely bizarre mannerisms explaining that the gossip-monger is just trying to cause trouble. Heather saying that they might end up slaughtered and hidden away in somebody's basement, with Sean retorting, ""that's stupid, the houses around here don't have basements."" And finally, my favourite line: ""Too bad about her face, Leather, but you can have her shoes!""Despite all the bad press this movie's received, I hope Kim Henkel enjoys what she created as much as I enjoy watching it.

7.0,Creepy in many ways (I'm in the minority again),"I liked this movie. I liked it in whole and in parts - meaning I enjoyed the film as a whole (and have watched it several times, inflicting it on various friends...), but there were touches in it that really creeped me, and that isn't something that happens every day. The film is your basic teenagers on the way home from the prom get lost and stuck and run into spooky family in the middle of nowhere - mayhem ensues. Actually, this is the movie I thought of (fondly) when I first heard about ""House of 1000 Corpses"". I like this movie much better, and not just because I REALLY want to bring it to a ""Matthew McConaghy Fan Club"" movie night.(SPOILERS)It's the details that make this movie. The wall of drivers' licenses that you can see in the background in one room of the creepy family's house, which implies they've been at this for a while. The filthy bathroom where you can't see the human skin hanging on the back of the door until you're already inside with the door closed.I've always found it hard to imagine a female villain character who actually ""works"" in a movie like this, unless she's either essentially browbeaten and incapable of individual action, or is utterly, irredeemably psychotic. This movie has a creepy female character who both casually flashes passersby from her office window (explaining only that she just got implants and everyone seems to want to see them) and flirts with cops while she has a girl tied up in her trunk. She also gives a variety of weird ""conspiracy theory""ish explanations for why she goes along with what the spooky family does.Most unusual of all is the weird guy in the limousine who shows up for no particular reason and implies that he put these people here for some reason - presumably to generate exactly the type of urban legends they are generating - and who might be.... Satan? Some underling, anyway. Maybe Ranger Asmodeus (from Equinox) has a cousin. ..The movie left me wondering - in the best possible way. Not the usual ""why did they make this?"" or ""how could they have thought this was good?"" But instead ""who is that guy? Does he have other enclaves of evil out there just waiting for his visits?"" and ""that woman - was she a victim at one point who talked her way into joining them as a survival mechanism, and then convinced herself that it was OK?"" Ya know?",creepy many ways im minority again,i liked this movie i liked it whole parts meaning i enjoyed film as whole have watched it several times inflicting it various friends but there were touches it that really creeped me that isnt something that happens every day film is your basic teenagers way home prom get lost stuck run into spooky family middle nowhere mayhem ensues actually this is movie i thought fondly when i first heard about house 1000 corpses i like this movie much better not just because i really want bring it matthew mcconaghy fan club movie night spoilers its details that make this movie wall drivers licenses that you can see background one room creepy familys house which implies theyve been at this while filthy bathroom where you cant see human skin hanging back door until youre already inside with door closed ive always found it hard imagine female villain character who actually works movie like this unless shes either essentially browbeaten incapable individual action or is utterly irredeemably psychotic this movie has creepy female character who both casually flashes passersby her office window explaining only that she just got implants everyone seems want see them flirts with cops while she has girl tied up her trunk she also gives variety weird conspiracy theory ish explanations why she goes along with what spooky family does most unusual all is weird guy limousine who shows up no particular reason implies that he put these people here some reason presumably generate exactly type urban legends they are generating who might be satan some underling anyway maybe ranger asmodeus equinox has cousin movie left me wondering best possible way not usual why did they make this or how could they have thought this was good but instead who is that guy does he have other enclaves evil out there just waiting his visits that woman was she victim at one point who talked her way into joining them as survival mechanism then convinced herself that it was ok ya know,0.4807823129251701,0.023469387755102048,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1.0,No stars.,"The third sequel in the Texas Chainsaw series is now more famous for starring Matthew McConaughey and Renée Zellweger, neither of whom, at the time the film was made, knew better than to accept such trashy roles. The film begins by asking us to care about a group of teens who leave their prom due to a couple having a fight and end up lost in the woods. This mere minutes after having driven away from their high school, which presumably resides in their hometown. Clearly they have not learned their way around much, but no matter. Before too long, they very soon find themselves running for their lives away from the famous freaky family, not only lost in their home town but, before long, also without their car. One of the biggest gripes that people have with this film (which is saying a lot, because there is nothing but stuff to gripe about) is that Leatherface seems to have become a transvestite. You can almost watch the transformation in the film, which seems to me to be sort of the result of trying to make Leatherface too complex. There is a point in the film where the trapped Jenny (Zellweger) tries to get Leatherface to help her escape, talking to him exactly like a psychiatrist would talk to a disturbed child.Come on, we know Leatherface is disturbed; I just don't understand why cross-dressing had to be added to his impressive list of deviations from the pattern of behaviors generally associated with reasonably well-adjusted people. On the other hand, Kim Henkel did co-write the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Tobe Hooper, and has thus been granted at least some right to tamper with the character. What you see in the movie, however, is a lot of tampering gone horribly, horribly wrong. If it ain't broken, as they say, don't fix it. You may end up making it worse.What is amazing to me is how far McConaughey and Zellweger have both come in spite of this film. As I was watching the film, I couldn't believe I was watching the same actor who had turned in such wonderful performances in movies like Bridget Jones' Diary and Cold Mountain, as well as another actor who displayed strong acting presence in movies like EdTV and U-571. Why the focus on Leatherface being a transvestite? Leatherface is a side character anyway, it is Vilmer (McConaughey) who is the star, which is sad because he plays such a belligerent, disgusting character. If you don't believe me that he's more the star than Leatherface, count how many people Leatherface, or anyone else, kills with a chainsaw in the movie (hint: none).Vilmer is the new head of household in the backwoods family, working as a tow-truck driver/reckless murderer and who has the fascinating addition of an electric leg that is operated by remote control. At one point, a high school kid pleads for help, then when he realizes Vilmer's one of the bad guys, he runs away from the truck (running straight down the street rather than into the woods to relative safety, of course), Vilmer gleefully chases him down, laughing and hooting and hollering all the while, and then runs him over five or six times before stashing his body on the back of the truck to later taunt one of his little friends with.As is to be expected, there is never any motive given behind any of the random killings, this is all just the sickening actions of an insane family in the woods, evidently comfortably separate from any sort of law enforcement or even the most tenuous interaction with greater civilization, waiting for unsuspecting teenagers to stumble into their midst. Interesting that the movie starts out as such a gigantic horror movie cliché, and still manages to go downhill from there.Horror movie sequels are first faced with the usually daunting task of justifying themselves. A horror movie sequel has to have a premise that gives it a reason for having been made, otherwise it is clearly a cash cow made to cash in on the success of the original film. Texas Chainsaw 4, instead, simply passes itself off as something of a remake of the original, rather than another sequel, and turns from the more plodding and slow-moving original to the mindless, completely over-the-top belligerence that you see here. The scenes at the house are peppered with stupid violence, at one point Vilmer throws Darla to the ground and steps on her neck with his powerful leg, nearly killing her by suffocation or by breaking her neck, clearly not caring which. Naturally, she gets up and complains that she could easily leave him and go back to her husband. Charming. Add cannibalism to the mix and you have a hilariously bad movie. Jenny spends much of the latter half of the movie trying to escape from the hungry hungry hicks, as we are constantly bombarded with the stupid, stupid characters and plot twists that the movie makes as it ineptly tries to combine the horror and comedy that even the most mildly competent horror film can display. This is exactly the kind of thing that really makes me wonder why, every time a new movie comes out in a certain series, I always go back and watch the whole series before watching it. I'm still working on The Friday the 13th movies, the Nightmares on Elm Street, and the Child's Play films, which are decidedly more fun than the Texas Chainsaws. And to make matters worse, I have heard nothing but bad things about the 2003 Texas Chainsaw.

5.0,"a ridiculous, overacted mess","This extremely erratic remake/sequel tries to follow the template of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", nevertheless twisting it into a bizarre modern blend of dark comedy and tasteless antics. Its the usual story of high school prom night turned bad as the typical airhead girlfriend, moron boyfriend and likable nerdy girl (Renee Zellweger) fall victim to a rural Texas dysfunctional family led by madman (Mathew McConaughey). If you've seen the previous ""Chainsaw"" films, then you should know what to expect, but this comes off so eccentric, that its impossible to take seriously. Mathew McConaughey tries way too hard to be insane as the maniacal Vilmer, and Renee Zellweger tries way to hard to be scared as the female lead. The rest of the characters are either mindless fodder or laughable afterthoughts such as Tyler Cone as Barry who's every line in the film is a literary quote, and Leatherface in drag and constantly screaming in dress and makeup is just way too wacky. McConaughey's character's leg is controlled by a remote actuator, and he slaps and cuts himself repeatedly while abusing everyone around him, especially Zellweger. Somehow a powerful organization is behind the control and funding of the torture tactics implemented by Vilmer and his clan, a strange plot device that completely throws the film into left field. Its a masochistic freak show, and little gore, hardly any chainsaw action, and plenty of silly inconsistencies (at one point a chainsaw cuts bricks off a chimney with no effort???) make this effort a real blunder.

10.0,The buzz is back!,Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1994) is a highly underrated horror film by the co-writer of the classic and seminal film Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Kim Henkel decided to make a quasi-sequel to the first film. A very odd but pleasing results make this one a must see for fans. The story revolves around a high school student (Renee Zellweger) and her friends who's traveling the back roads toward their school prom. Along the way their car breaks down and the bump into a very bizarre individual named Vilmer (Matthew Mc Conaughey playing himself) who decides to have fun with his new found friends. One of the clues that are very important to this movie can be found on the side of Vilmer's tow truck. Vilmer also has a hobby that he shares with his dinner companions.I don't know why so many people hate this movie. I found it to be very unique and intelligent. Nothing is spoon fed and the performances are up to snuff. Renee Zellweger and Matthew Mc Conaughy are excellent as the wall flower lead and Vilmer respectfully. When this movie was finally released it was badly edited and it had a virtually non-existent release. It's a shame that people have to slam this movie. I found it quite entertaining. If you like the original then you'll love this follow up to the first film.Highly recommended.Keep an eye out for a special surprise at the end. Those who have watched the first movie will enjoy it.

7.0,"Totally bonkers, and surprisingly watchable.","The fourth film in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, The Next Generation, receives a lot of flack from many fans of all things Leatherface, but although I can appreciate why (it rarely takes matters seriously and doesn't make much sense), I still manage to get a kick out of the movie.

7.0,"It's Bad, but then it's pretty good too, I just like it!","This film is impossible to describe, it's really badly made, but I went through a stage of watching it repeatedly for some reason. The plot is almost non-existent and if there is one it's bizarre. It's not even slightly scary and I'm not sure if it even tries to be, it's easily the worst in a genuinely good series. The Leatherface is awfully played, more or less everyone can't act to save their lives, the two leads excluded. There is no actual massacre nor any chainsaw related deaths. So thats all the bad stuff out the way.Now the on the plus side, there is one thing. Matthew McConaughey. The first time I saw it I was stunned by his performance in it. He's really good. Very menacing and maniacal. Also Renee gives a decent performance as the sprightly young heroine.This film does have the power to annoy though. ""Oh my god my torch has run out"" ""I know, You two go and follow the mysterious car....I'll wander about in the woods with what is possibly the worst torch in existence...Oop..It's broke.""The ending however, is the real cherry on top which makes most people I know hate it. No kind of sense has been made so far but I'm working on it. Where did that plane come from, why did it kill Vilmer, who to him, must've looked like he was also being chased by a man with the chainsaw. So was it all some kind of cult? Why have the police not seen this place? It's not that far from a school let alone civilisation like the original was. Funny how this school where they travel about a mile from is right next to a huge desert too. The list of plot holes could go on....but if you can get past the awful acting, irritating plot, hate-able characters (which is a good thing I guess) and the fact it makes no sense, you might just enjoy yourself.

7.0,Worth another look,"This movie has aged extremely well. Yes Oscar's alum Renee Zellweger (Jerry Maguire) and Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyer's Club) which they made this right out of college. But there's more to it than that. Yes the film falls into the so bad it's good category with some truly ridiculous performances and dialogue outside of the two leads. But There is a raw primal intensity that rules the film making the overly comical feel like true horror especially with the insane twist. Now I'm not saying it's believable by any means but theres a twisted theology that resonates through the proceedings. Written and directed by Kim Henkel of the original film it definitely has a weird retro feel to it all. Both Zellweger and the sexy and twisted McConaughey come out on top of the film. Both of their performances are solid and definitely leave the promise of their future cinematic endeavors and Oscar wins. All in all there's nothing like it. It's flawed and nowhere near perfect but its original and wild.

6.0,Bizarre comedy sequel is okay as long as you don't take it seriously,"This, the fourth in the original series of CHAINSAW films, is without a doubt the oddest yet. Gone is the grinding horror of the original movie, in favour of an out-and-out comedy. It's easy to see why no more sequels were released after this, at least until Michael Bay's franchise 'reboot' – the formula had been worked into the ground and only repetition could follow. THE NEXT GENERATION is widely regarded as the worst of the series, a total non-event with more horror to be found in a pair of smelly socks, but I think critics are missing the point. This isn't MEANT to be a horror flick – instead it's a comedy.The threadbare plot is nothing new, a simple sequence of events designed to get some innocent teenagers into the chainsaw household. Once here, the sole surviving female finds herself menaced by a group of mad men (and a woman!). Director Kim Henkel, who wrote and produced the original classic, has plenty of affinity with his material and his focus here is to create new extremes out of old. The film is a chronicle of screeching insanity with every actor encouraged to go way over the top in the call of duty, and I have to admit, I enjoyed the film simply because it's so odd.Of course, it's saddled with cheesy '90s production values and a dearth of characterisation. The teenage 'good guys' are utterly devoid of interest, and the only interesting thing about the main character of Jenny is that the actress portraying her is Renee Zellweger, years before she became really famous in Hollywood. There's no sign of future greatness here, Zellweger is no different from a hundred other teenage scream queens. No, the real interest comes from the complete nutters portraying the 'family'. Leatherface is back, acted by a different actor and this time dressing up as an old woman; he's not menacing at all here, but instead slightly endearing and completely loopy, screaming just as much as Zellweger! The real star of the show, though, is another pre-stardom actor, Matthew McConaughey, playing demented murderer Vilmer. Interesting, McConaughey takes over from ANOTHER pre-stardom actor, Viggo Mortensen, who played virtually the same character in the previous sequel, Leatherface. McConaughey goes above and beyond with a performance of immense energy and physicality and watching him creeping around, complete with bionic leg (!) and harassing people is what makes the film.So there you have THE NEXT GENERATION. It's an overpadded film, full of long, slightly dull chase scenes and an overacting McConaughey literally chewing up the scenery. It may not be art, but I did laugh a lot in comparison to many other so-called Hollywood 'comedies'.",bizarre comedy sequel is okay as long as you dont take it seriously,this fourth original series chainsaw films is without doubt oddest yet gone is grinding horror original movie favour out out comedy its easy see why no more sequels were released after this at least until michael bays franchise reboot formula had been worked into ground only repetition could follow next generation is widely regarded as worst series total non event with more horror be found pair smelly socks but i think critics are missing point this isnt meant be horror flick instead its comedy threadbare plot is nothing new simple sequence events designed get some innocent teenagers into chainsaw household once here sole surviving female finds herself menaced by group mad men woman director kim henkel who wrote produced original classic has plenty affinity with his material his focus here is create new extremes out old film is chronicle screeching insanity with every actor encouraged go way over top call duty i have admit i enjoyed film simply because its so odd course its saddled with cheesy 90s production values dearth characterisation teenage good guys are utterly devoid interest only interesting thing about main character jenny is that actress portraying her is renee zellweger years before she became really famous hollywood theres no sign future greatness here zellweger is no different hundred other teenage scream queens no real interest comes complete nutters portraying family leatherface is back acted by different actor this time dressing up as old woman hes not menacing at all here but instead slightly endearing completely loopy screaming just as much as zellweger real star show though is another pre stardom actor matthew mcconaughey playing demented murderer vilmer interesting mcconaughey takes over another pre stardom actor viggo mortensen who played virtually same character previous sequel leatherface mcconaughey goes above beyond with performance immense energy physicality watching him creeping around complete with bionic leg harassing people is what makes film so there you have next generation its overpadded film full long slightly dull chase scenes overacting mcconaughey literally chewing up scenery it may not be art but i did laugh lot comparison many other so called hollywood comedies,0.4508592417683327,0.08834940312213037,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"

9.0,A postmodern dismemberment of Hooper's film--and I mean that in the best possible way,"""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"" follows a group of dimwitted Texas teenagers who take a wrong turn on prom night and end up in the hands of Leatherface, his psychotic brothers, and one of their slightly-mad girlfriends. To put it plainly, if there is any film that is going to divide an audience, it's this one, and most people will likely hate it for valid reasons. That being said, I count myself as one of the few admirers of this movie. Perhaps it's because I saw it at an impressionable age, or maybe it's just because I love a good atmospheric horror flick (and this one does have loads of atmosphere). Regardless, I've always found this film to be a lot of fun. It's not scary--it's certainly strange, sometimes even hilarious (both inadvertently and advertently)--but it's never quite boring.Many people have criticized the film over the years for lacking a chainsaw killing, its recreation of the dinner scene with pizza instead of flesh, etc. These people are missing the point. Henkel, whether you respect it or not, was deconstructing the original film here for a gen-x audience. Power up the chainsaw? Leatherface can barely do anything but run around screaming. Cook flesh? They'd rather eat pizza. Terrorize a group of young teenagers? These villains can hardly keep it together--one of them can't even walk without a remote control to power his animatronic leg. And best of all? Their operations are all overseen by a mysterious ""Man in Black."" Why? Nobody quite knows. Even the family doesn't seem to.I am still not entirely sure what Henkel's point was here, but it's clear he aspired to create a degenerated version of the original film, where its central elements have been twisted into a state of fruitlessness and decay. Perhaps a commentary on the culture, or of horror films at the time--it's hard to say. Regardless, this film is recklessly amusing, unabashedly corny, and never ceases to leave your jaw on the floor for a myriad of reasons. It's of course gone down in history for being the major debut of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, who play the mousey final girl and Leatherface's madcap brother/ringleader, and both are reasonably good here. Even the supporting cast handle the material well enough, and most of the corniness is a result of Henkel's often hammy dialogue. When all is said and done, though, I cannot bring myself to despise this film for all its shortcomings. It's not a ""good"" film per se, but I do see it as something of a failed experiment for Henkel. I have watched this film dozens of times and still have not quite decoded whatever it is he was trying to do here, but I am still endlessly fascinated by the haze surrounding it. It is a pure oddity, and one of the few true ones of its era, for better or for worse.",postmodern dismemberment hoopers film i mean that best possible way,texas chainsaw massacre next generation follows group dimwitted texas teenagers who take wrong turn prom night end up hands leatherface his psychotic brothers one their slightly mad girlfriends put it plainly if there is any film that is going divide audience its this one most people will likely hate it valid reasons that being said i count myself as one few admirers this movie perhaps its because i saw it at impressionable age or maybe its just because i love good atmospheric horror flick this one does have loads atmosphere regardless ive always found this film be lot fun its not scary its certainly strange sometimes even hilarious both inadvertently advertently but its never quite boring many people have criticized film over years lacking chainsaw killing its recreation dinner scene with pizza instead flesh etc these people are missing point henkel whether you respect it or not was deconstructing original film here gen x audience power up chainsaw leatherface can barely do anything but run around screaming cook flesh theyd rather eat pizza terrorize group young teenagers these villains can hardly keep it together one them cant even walk without remote control power his animatronic leg best all their operations are all overseen by mysterious man black why nobody quite knows even family doesnt seem i am still not entirely sure what henkels point was here but its clear he aspired create degenerated version original film where its central elements have been twisted into state fruitlessness decay perhaps commentary culture or horror films at time its hard say regardless this film is recklessly amusing unabashedly corny never ceases leave your jaw floor myriad reasons its course gone down history being major debut renee zellweger matthew mcconaughey who play mousey final girl leatherfaces madcap brother ringleader both are reasonably good here even supporting cast handle material well enough most corniness is result henkels often hammy dialogue when all is said done though i cannot bring myself despise this film all its shortcomings its not good film per se but i do see it as something failed experiment henkel i have watched this film dozens times still have not quite decoded whatever it is he was trying do here but i am still endlessly fascinated by haze surrounding it it is pure oddity one few true ones its era better or worse,0.5645739742437856,0.04140461215932915,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.25}"

6.0,before they were stars,"The first stories about the infamous cannibal family emerged in 1973. It's 1996 and it's been quiet for a few years. Jenny (Renée Zellweger) is at her high school prom. She gets brought along with her 'friends' when they get into a car crash. She heads off to find help. She and her friends fall prey to the secret cannibals and murderous tow truck driver Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey).This is a few months after Dazed and Confused. Both Zellweger and McConaughey would go from that indie darling to this forgotten horror comedy and eventually onwards to becoming Academy Awards winning stars. It's amazing to see the two Texans doing an iconic Texas horror franchise. Strict franchise fanatics would hate this Leatherface. There's no way any cinema snobs would like this. At the time, these future stars were nobodies. I can understand its dismissal at the time of its release. I myself am watching it for the first time. It is pure joy to watch McConaughey go full crazy and Zellweger finding her inner scream queen. This is also a little fun. Darla is a little funny but the drive-thru takes it too far. This movie has probably improved markedly due to the performances of its famous stars.",before they were stars,first stories about infamous cannibal family emerged 1973 its 1996 its been quiet few years jenny ren e zellweger is at her high school prom she gets brought along with her friends when they get into car crash she heads off find help she her friends fall prey secret cannibals murderous tow truck driver vilmer matthew mcconaughey this is few months after dazed confused both zellweger mcconaughey would go that indie darling this forgotten horror comedy eventually onwards becoming academy awards winning stars its amazing see two texans doing iconic texas horror franchise strict franchise fanatics would hate this leatherface theres no way any cinema snobs would like this at time these future stars were nobodies i can understand its dismissal at time its release i myself am watching it first time it is pure joy watch mcconaughey go full crazy zellweger finding her inner scream queen this is also little fun darla is little funny but drive thru takes it too far this movie has probably improved markedly due performances its famous stars,0.5467816091954023,0.038768472906403936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"

6.0,I have a soft spot for this movie,"Written and directed by Kim Henkel, who wrote the original film, this take on the Sawyer family has sadly been forgotten, but it had - as so many films do - a rocky creation, a two year period where it disappeared and features two big stars who pretty much don't want anything to do with it. It's also the last movie in the original timeline of the films before remake and reboot and reimagining became the constant status quo for chainsaw movies.I can see why some people dislike this movie. After all, there's now a thousand-year-old secret society paying off the Sawyers - who now choose pizza over human flesh - to kill people to keep the population in a constant state of fear. Or maybe they do it so people can achieve transcendence through that terror. Leatherface, who used to be a killing machine, now struggles with not only his ability to capture and murder the teengers, but his sexuality, cross-dressing and screaming like a child.He also does not use a chainsaw.The real center of this story is Renée Zellweger's Jenny, who Henkel wrote the story around, claiming that was about ""her transformation, her refusal to shut up, to be silenced, to be victimized. And by extension her refusal to be oppressed."" In the director's cut, it's shown that she's been abused her whole life, so the terror of the Sawyers leaves her unafraid.Actually, they're now the Slaughters, not the Sawyers, and led by the other big star in this production - he wasn't at the time - Matthew McConaughey as Vilmer Slaughter, a maniac who combines the characteristics of the HItchhiker, Chop Top and Leatherface with a cybernetic leg and the need to self-scar himself. His wife Darla reveals much of the conspiracy theory in the film, except that she also claims that she has a bomb implanted in her skull and that Vilmer is from space.This movie played 27 theaters, then Japan and then disappeared for two years, as CAA wanted nothing to ruin the success of McConaughey. It finally played in twenty cities in 1997. Yet it has its fans, as no less a Chainsaw fan as Joe Bob Briggs said, ""This is the best horror film of the 90s"" and called this ""a flick so terrifying and brilliant that it makes the other two Chainsaw sequels seem like ""After-School Specials.""The end of the film features John Dugan, Grandfather from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Paul A. Partain, who was Franklin and Marilyn Burns, who was Sally. I love that she locks eyes with Kenny as the movie closes. I also adore that this movie has so many Texas bands, like ""Der Einziger Weg"" by Debbie Harry and Robert Jacks (who was Leather in this), plus songs by Roky Erickson and Daniel Johnston.",i have soft spot this movie,written directed by kim henkel who wrote original film this take sawyer family has sadly been forgotten but it had as so many films do rocky creation two year period where it disappeared features two big stars who pretty much dont want anything do with it its also last movie original timeline films before remake reboot reimagining became constant status quo chainsaw movies i can see why some people dislike this movie after all theres now thousand year old secret society paying off sawyers who now choose pizza over human flesh kill people keep population constant state fear or maybe they do it so people can achieve transcendence through that terror leatherface who used be killing machine now struggles with not only his ability capture murder teengers but his sexuality cross dressing screaming like child he also does not use chainsaw real center this story is ren e zellwegers jenny who henkel wrote story around claiming that was about her transformation her refusal shut up be silenced be victimized by extension her refusal be oppressed directors cut its shown that shes been abused her whole life so terror sawyers leaves her unafraid actually theyre now slaughters not sawyers led by other big star this production he wasnt at time matthew mcconaughey as vilmer slaughter maniac who combines characteristics hitchhiker chop top leatherface with cybernetic leg need self scar himself his wife darla reveals much conspiracy theory film except that she also claims that she has bomb implanted her skull that vilmer is space this movie played 27 theaters then japan then disappeared two years as caa wanted nothing ruin success mcconaughey it finally played twenty cities 1997 yet it has its fans as no less chainsaw fan as joe bob briggs said this is best horror film 90s called this flick so terrifying brilliant that it makes other two chainsaw sequels seem like after school specials end film features john dugan grandfather texas chainsaw massacre paul partain who was franklin marilyn burns who was sally i love that she locks eyes with kenny as movie closes i also adore that this movie has so many texas bands like der einziger weg by debbie harry robert jacks who was leather this plus songs by roky erickson daniel johnston,0.43906249999999997,0.11822916666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,This Is Some Weird Stuff.... But I Like It!,"Okay, I know everyone's opinion is that the original movie is always better than the remake, and there is truth to that, but some movies have exceptions, like this one. I really thought the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was really cheesy, and it really didn't entertain me. I know what your gonna say, this movie was very entertaining, scary, and was anything but cheesy back in 1974, but it isn't 1974! To me a remake is just updating the film, but keeping it at it's original levels, in which most cases in remaking films, they just completely change the story and switch things back and forth, until youv'e got a whole different movie. This movie pretty much stuck to it's basic lines of the original film. Now with the acting in this film, it wasn't all too bad, although I've seen WAY better from Renee Zellweger. Matthew McConaughey's acting is always usually pretty good, so his acting level was the same. I also think a good thing about the movie is that the producer of the original film (Kim Henkel) directed this remake. I think that's good because she helped make the original, and should have the experience of dealing with this kind of movie. So, what I guess I'm trying to say here is that I really did enjoy this movie.
