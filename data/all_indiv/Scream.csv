1.0,An arrogant presumption of filmmakers with no originality of their own,"Wes Craven's '90s cult horror film ""Scream"" (1996) was a groundbreaking flick that set numerous trends for the future of the horror genre. It was charming, well-acted and coherent, so it was also simply well-written. The first two sequels were good sequels that were fun, managed to keep a lot of the charm of the original and played a game with the endless sequels that were made in that period of horror classics and today have their very peculiar, but quite nice pop cultural value. The last part of the grand master came years later. ""Scream 4"" (2011) was not quite in the jolt of the original, and incidentally designed as such, trilogy, but was still entertaining and the signature of the director was still noticeable and valuable. Seven years after Wes Craven's death, the franchise is now being driven to the wall by insanely arrogant film producers and the woke age along with its concomitants of lack of respect and lack of originality of its own.But from the beginning. The new Scream film claims to be a ""Requel"", as it also certainly does not forget to mention permanently in the film in clumsy reference to the self-irony of the original. A ""Requel"", we are instructed in the film, is a mixture of a sequel and a remake. So far so good, but more on that later.The film actually begins in the classic Scream style and fulfills the one pole of the remake quite alright: an initial murder, which however remains only a murder attempt, the establishment of a circle of friends, (apparent) love for horror films and slasher moments, which now already obviously should not come up short. Then the other pole of a ""Requel"" comes into play: Connections to the previous parts are built up, old characters are introduced and the myth is dug into as if one were a mole. So it comes out that apparently everything revolves around the previously unknown child of Loomis, one of the two killers from the first part. A classic movie flow is unwound, with allusions to the horror movie world, a classic story progression, and even painfully foreseeable plot developments. As I said, so far so good.As a viewer, you realize that while the weakest film in the series is taking place before your very eyes here, you still don't get the impression that this part was actually going to be particularly bad either. But to err is human, and trusting modern Hollywood productions is about as appropriate for one's health as stabbing one's heart with a long kitchen knife. The finale of the film should become the confirmation of this thesis and concomitantly the destruction of the preceding 85 minutes. Here the filmmakers, i.e. Screenwriters, directors and producers, seem to have succumbed to a premonition that their film would fail. But this lack of self-confidence on the part of the uncreative rascals was simply passed off, and such a thing is increasingly easy to do these days, in an age of wokeness, the desire for dead discourse, and the lack of ability for one's own self-criticism. Once again, the fans of the original and its successors were identified as the world devourers of modern cinematic art, i.e. Those who always raised a franchise to the Everest that today's uncreative filmmakers keep trying to blow up.The finale of ""Scream"" (2022) pursues the thesis that those fans are always the branches in the gears of the bicycle ridden by the well-heeled and only ever demanding Hollywood aristocrats of today. Those fans who make up the very largest part of a potential audience, and who so far seem to have only made the mistake of passionately liking a franchise. The ""Scream"" franchise is one such franchise that has been kept alive by such fans, fans who are now portrayed as potentially insane murderers in this new installment. At the same time, they are still too dumb to understand modern movies, such as ""The Babadook"" (2014), and the derivation for this is that they - watch out, cleverness afoot - are into movies like ""Scream"" (1996), i.e. Those stupid and bad horror movies.This is admittedly explained in a - attention - ""Requel"" by just such a luminary of that time. Well, thank you!The whole thing could have been made humorous and more all-encompassing, perhaps in such a way that modern Woke society gets at least a bit of fat in a reflected way - then you could have taken it self-ironic - but one-sided moralizing of people, the basic ideas of democracy, discussion and the freedom of art is no fun. It's only through the finale that small points in the film that you could have simply overlooked before also start to bother you, but in the retrospective, i.e. After the final viewing of the film, this no longer seems possible. The disrespectful treatment of Dewey (David Arquette), for example, the clumsy man-bashing, i.e. The right-around variant of sexism in the 21st century, and a half-dozen other pandering to a Twitter community, which is 90% sure not a dollar for a tickets to see this film are simply too much of a bad thing. In the end, postulating that the film was made ""For Wes"" is probably no longer just questionable after having constantly ridiculed one's craft.Those responsible should be ashamed of this film, but since shame obviously hardly seems to be a thing these days, that's not to be expected either way. Just as little as good counter-arguments from those who refuse to communicate and the modern Lancelots of discourse killers. In such a structure one does not need to mention any names. As is well known, fans of 90s horror wrote them on murder slips anyway and exchange them full of hatred in forums in order to throw branches that break the neck of modern film art into the bicycle spokes. Irony off. But irony also seems to be one of those great things that are almost completely lost these days, so what the heck.Arrogant, stupid and certainly without such ""unfashionable"" values as respect and discourse skills.",arrogant presumption filmmakers with no originality their own,wes cravens 90s cult horror film scream 1996 was groundbreaking flick that set numerous trends future horror genre it

4.0,Honestly one of the worst of the franchise,"Scream 5 (idiotically titled Scream) when it's a sequel, is honestly a bad slasher and one of the worst of the franchise, a disgrace to the first one, how does it have a 7.2?Scream 5 is one of the most predictable slashers I've ever seen, it follows the basic slasher playbook (which we all expected) and thought it could disguise it with just how meta it is.Honestly, it's one of the least cinematic slashers I've ever seen, almost every character shot is close up, like the film couldn't afford wide angle lenses, I could make a 5 minute short film with my phone and it would be better shot than this piece.Also, we have the worst Ghostface(s) since the one in Scream 3, their motivations were terrible and incredibly unexplained, also, how the actual tarnation did the one girl survive getting shot 3 times and burned on the stove? No one would survive that, she didn't even have anything to put her out with.I haven't even gotten to the terrible acting, the only ones who did a good job were Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox, great as always.It's also extremely sanitized for a requel, I thought it would take some risks, nope, it only kills 1 major character from the franchise, it pulled all the punches and played it safe, which was very disappointing.We've seen this 4 times before, a copy and paste variant of one of the greatest slashers ever, and the ending is one of the most predictable I've ever seen because we all knew what was going to happen?If the killers were good killers they would've killed the girls while they could, their motivations were just like everyone else's.Terrible acting, an extremely formulaic plot line, and a bad filming style make this film one of the worst of the franchise.And I'm gonna give Scream 5, a D+👎",honestly one worst franchise,scream 5 idiotically titled scream when its sequel is honestly bad slasher one worst franchise disgrace first one how does it have 7 2 scream 5 is one most predictable slashers ive ever seen it follows basic slasher playbook which we all expected thought it could disguise it with just how meta it is honestly its one least cinematic slashers ive ever seen almost every character shot is close up like film couldnt afford wide angle lenses i could make 5 minute short film with my phone it would be better shot than this piece also we have worst ghostface s since one scream 3 their motivations were terrible incredibly unexplained also how actual tarnation did one girl survive getting shot 3 times burned stove no one would survive that she didnt even have anything put her out with i havent even gotten terrible acting only ones who did good job were neve campbell courtney cox great as always its also extremely sanitized requel i thought it would take some risks nope it only kills 1 major character franchise it pulled all punches played it safe which was very disappointing weve seen this 4 times before copy paste variant one greatest slashers ever ending is one most predictable ive ever seen because we all knew what was going happen if killers were good killers they wouldve killed girls while they could their motivations were just like everyone elses terrible acting extremely formulaic plot line bad filming style make this film one worst franchise im gonna give scream 5 d,0.5833760683760685,-0.09596153846153846,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1.0,RIP Wes Craven,"As an avid Twitter user, it was a tough ordeal avoiding spoilers and the reveal of the killer(s). But now I understand it wasn't worth it. The killer reveal wasn't surprising at all, I actually hated that reveal, it was so clumsy and stupid.This film was more meta than the previous installments, not only they referenced Stab movies, but they also referenced past four Scream entries as in meta terms. The script was good when explaining the rules, meta aspects and the main ""requel"" trope, but when it comes to actual dialogues, it faltered most of the time.I loved Jenna Ortega's performance, she was outstanding. But I didn't liked the rest of the cast's performances, they were boring and annoying.One of the biggest letdowns in horror legacy sequels of this year, after Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022).I hope Scream 6 will be going to turn over a new leaf to this franchise.",rip wes craven,as avid twitter user it was tough ordeal avoiding spoilers reveal killer s but now i understand it wasnt worth it killer reveal wasnt surprising at all i actually hated that reveal it was so clumsy stupid this film was more meta than previous installments not only they referenced stab movies but they also referenced past four scream entries as meta terms script was good when explaining rules meta aspects main requel trope but when it comes actual dialogues it faltered most time i loved jenna ortegas performance she was outstanding but i didnt liked rest casts performances they were boring annoying one biggest letdowns horror legacy sequels this year after texas chainsaw massacre 2022 i hope scream 6 will be going turn over new leaf this franchise,0.6101370851370852,0.021308321308321308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
4.0,I Wanted To Like It More...!,"So, after waiting nearly 11 years since Scream 4 back in 2011, we finally get another Scream film, Scream 5, stupidly named Scream & even mocks the title in itself in the film but you'll hear about that later.The film follows another series of Ghostface Killings that are somehow connected to the new characters of the new generation & so with the help of the Original Characters, they all try to piece together who is doing this & why.I found the film to be mostly disappointing, I pains me to say that but it could've been so, so much better.The Pros:The homage to the Original Scream Films including the first one were ace. You knew immediately as soon as the film started what ones were what, the traits, the script, the scenes themselves, everything that paid homage was ace.The gore was full on in this one & I loved it. Better than the other Scream Films in terms of gore anyway...The opening was good & creative & again, the homage to the original film was also a plus for that reason alone.The kills were pretty brutal & the 18+ was a pleasant surprise.The Cons:The Story & it's twist sucked & here's everyone saying Scream 4's Story & Motivations were kak seriously.The film's kills were too few & far between. Too much chatty, blah, blah, blah scenes. It also seemed the male characters were getting killed off more easily than the female ones were.The characters were unlikeable, a lot of them were whiny & up themselves. Which brings me to the main trio who by the way were used too sparingly to the point where the film didn't even feel like a Scream Film at all & more of a cheap Netflix Film.The pacing was off a little & the runtime wasn't justified at 1 hour & 48 minutes.The Cinema Snob digs when referencing other crappy Horrors like Babadook, The Witch etc were unneeded.The film itself didn't feel very Scream like at all & again the lacking of the original characters had a good chunk to do with this. It felt too modern & wacky & too generic & out there to differentiate it from other slashers preferably to those on Netflix.The ending was a dumb & just plain embarrassing. All the women lived & all the men died typical.And the cherry on the cake, Dewey getting killed off!! That! Was! BAD!! I mean seriously, why him!? Why not Gale or someone else!? No, it had to be him & in such a callous way too!! That for me was the biggest downfall, if it weren't for that, then I would've gave the film a higher rating, but nah, that was a massive middle finger to the fans if ever we saw it!Overall, it's disappointing & it pains me to say that, it's definitely my least favourite now as of this date! The story sucked, the twists & motivations was weak to forgettably bad & the death of Dewey was just the final nail in the coffin.Give it a watch, but honestly I'd steer clear of this one if you love the previous 4. Scream 4 for me will always be the best one & the last true Scream Film before it went down hill in this instalment. 4/10.",i wanted like it more,so after waiting nearly 11 years since scream 4 back 2011 we finally get another scream film scream 5 stupidly named scream even mocks title itself film but youll hear about that later film follows another series ghostface killings that are somehow connected new characters new generation so with help original characters they all try piece together who is doing this why i found film be mostly disappointing i pains me say that but it couldve been so so much better pros homage original scream films including first one were ace you knew immediately as soon as film started what ones were what traits script scenes themselves everything that paid homage was ace gore was full this one i loved it better than other scream films terms gore anyway opening was good creative again homage original film was also plus that reason alone kills were pretty brutal 18 was pleasant surprise cons story its twist sucked heres everyone saying scream 4s story motivations were kak seriously films kills were too few far between too much chatty blah blah blah scenes it also seemed male characters were getting killed off more easily than female ones were characters were unlikeable lot them were whiny up themselves which brings me main trio who by way were used too sparingly point where film didnt even feel like scream film at all more cheap netflix film pacing was off little runtime wasnt justified at 1 hour 48 minutes cinema snob digs when referencing other crappy horrors like babadook witch etc were unneeded film itself didnt feel very scream like at all again lacking original characters had good chunk do with this it felt too modern wacky too generic out there differentiate it other slashers preferably those netflix ending was dumb just plain embarrassing all women lived all men died typical cherry cake dewey getting killed off that was bad i mean seriously why him why not gale or someone else no it had be him such callous way too that me was biggest downfall if it werent that then i wouldve gave film higher rating but nah that was massive middle finger fans if ever we saw it overall its disappointing it pains me say that its definitely my least favourite now as this date story sucked twists motivations was weak forgettably bad death dewey was just final nail coffin give it watch but honestly id steer clear this one if you love previous 4 scream 4 me will always be best one last true scream film before it went down hill this instalment 4 10,0.5244184188827046,0.08266027623170481,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"

5.0,"Well, sure, why not?...","Of course I have seen the previous ""Scream"" movies way before I sat down to watch the 2022 movie ""Scream"" from writers James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. But I have to be honest, I haven't been much of a fan of the ""Scream"" franchise, though I have seen the movie on the account of it being horror movies. So I wasn't really harboring much of any expectations to the 2022 movie.And with good cause, because directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett didn't really deliver anything that haven't been seen previously in the numerous ""Scream"" movies. Sure, there were new characters in the storyline, but essentially it was just the same old soup boiled on flavorless bones. So if you have seen the previous movies, you have essentially already seen the 2022 movie ""Scream"" as well. But chances are, that if you are a fan of the franchise, then you certainly will find some greater enjoyment in this 2022 addition to the franchise than I did.The storyline, while it certainly was watchable, just was too mundane and generic. And it was essentially just the same routine done again, but with new faces. Oh, and with some recurring faces too to reprise the 'legacy' characters, as they were called in the movie.For a horror movie, then the 2022 movie ""Scream"" just wasn't outstanding, and it is a movie that quickly will fade from my memory now that I have seen it. But then again, this wasn't a movie that I was particularly looking forward to getting to watch.The acting performances in the movie were good, and that goes for both the new cast and the former ""Scream"" stars returning to reprise their characters. I will say that it was most certainly David Arquette that put on the most memorably performance in this movie.Sure, the 2022 ""Scream"" movie caters to the fans of the franchise. But for us casual viewers that have seen the previous movies or at least have familiarity with the franchise, then this 2022 movie was just sort of mundane. I am sure that if you are new to the franchise, then the 2022 movie ""Scream"" is a good movie.I have to say that, for me personally, then ""Scream"" felt like a fully and wholly unnecessary movie.My rating of ""Scream"" lands on a mediocre five out of ten stars.",well sure why not,course i have seen previous scream movies way before i sat down watch 2022 movie scream writers james vanderbilt guy busick but i have be honest i havent been much fan scream franchise though i have seen movie account it being horror movies so i wasnt really harboring much any expectations 2022 movie with good cause because directors matt bettinelli olpin tyler gillett didnt really deliver anything that havent been seen previously numerous scream movies sure there were new characters storyline but essentially it was just same old soup boiled flavorless bones so if you have seen previous movies you have essentially already seen 2022 movie scream as well but chances are that if you are fan franchise then you certainly will find some greater enjoyment this 2022 addition franchise than i did storyline while it certainly was watchable just was too mundane generic it was essentially just same routine done again but with new faces oh with some recurring faces too reprise legacy characters as they were called movie horror movie then 2022 movie scream just wasnt outstanding it is movie that quickly will fade my memory now that i have seen it but then again this wasnt movie that i was particularly looking forward getting watch acting performances movie were good that goes both new cast former scream stars returning reprise their characters i will say that it was most certainly david arquette that put most memorably performance this movie sure 2022 scream movie caters fans franchise but us casual viewers that have seen previous movies or at least have familiarity with franchise then this 2022 movie was just sort mundane i am sure that if you are new franchise then 2022 movie scream is good movie i have say that me personally then scream felt like fully wholly unnecessary movie my rating scream lands mediocre five out ten stars,0.44240094396344404,0.14790464165464168,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.42}"
2.0,Unnecessary sequel/reboot,"SCREAM (2022) is a movie that feels totally unnecessary. It's a film full of interchangeable generic Gen Z actors and continuing to drag all the older ones back into a dying franchise. First the filmmakers really need to learn the timeline. The new bland main character Sam says that after the events of the original film, the copycat murders occurred about every decade. So let's see: 1996, 1998, 2000, 2011, 2022. Yeah, that's every decade! Lol. Next, how is Sam a full 5 years older than her sister and group of friends when she looks the same age as them? She's supposed to be like early 20s and they all look early 20s. Sam's age doesn't line up. Billy got her mother pregnant and died in 1996, so she should be at least 26. But the movie says she's 5 years older than her sister who can't be more than 17, which makes Sam 22.Next, they cast the most forgettable group of actors possible for this. The dialogue and humor was incredibly awkward. All of the 21st century, social media, self-aware dialogues were pretentious. I don't believe real people interact like this. I physically cringed throughout the curly-haired girl's REQUEL monologue. Even the acting within all the Stab movies they were watching was bad and cringe. I could have done without a couple of the returning actors, too. Courtney Cox is looking rougher with each new Scream movie. And the aging blonde actress from Scream 4 creeps me out with her eternally receding hairline. Was Randy's sister married to Adonis? How did THAT woman manage to sire those 2 fashion model looking people?Then there's the lack of logic. How did Sam's sister Tara miraculously survive the opening attack from Ghostface? She didn't look like someone who'd just been stabbed multiple times. The siblings big emotional scene in the hospital room was such bad acting lacking any kind of resonance. What father abandons his family and daughter that he raised for over a decade just because he found out she isn't his biological child? Why is Tara holding this against Sam? Her older sister is pouring out her soul to her explaining her whole life was turned upside down when she was like a pre-teen and the younger sister has zero sympathy? Why is there no one ever around in places where there should be a reasonable amount of people, like the hospital? A reasonably sized ""small"" town like Woodsboro shouldn't have empty hallways and waiting rooms. How did it take Sam and Dewey seemingly forever to get to the ""small town"" hospital? Why is the police force so oblivious to all these murders? They know that this town has a history of serial killers and copycats. Their Sheriff and key Deputies keep getting slaughtered and they don't seem to care.I literally forgot about a couple of the teen characters during the chunk of the film that focused on the 2 sisters, Dewey, Sidney, and Gale. When they showed up again after about 40 minutes, I was like ""oh, yeah she's in this movie"". In fact, the only 2 side characters I remembered were the twins and I recall early on predicting they were the killers and I thought for sure when Mindy joked that she was the killer, she really wasn't joking. Turns out the person she was making the joke to was one of the killers. THEN that's when I knew who her accomplice was, especially when he tried to divert Sam's attention towards her sister. The girl killer was pure cringe trying to imitate the iconic Stu from the original classic Scream of 1996. Why did Chad throw his phone away? Just wipe the blood on your jacket so he can work the buttons properly. Characters are stabbed multiple times, shot in the guts and somehow still completely lucid and walking and moving normally afterwards. Girl gets shot 3 times point blank range and somehow is still alive and screaming at the top of her lungs as she's consumed by fire. She should have been dead from the gunshots, not the fire...also turns out she still wasn't dead. Got to be a shot to the head because this franchise is utterly dumb at this point. Unless you're shot in the head, no matter how maimed you are in other vital parts of your body, you can fully function with no problem.Too many talking killers. Just kill your prey and get it over with. And the writers try to somehow redeem Billy Loomis as a hero in the afterlife as the ghost muse for his illegitimate daughter. Then they kill off my absolute favorite character of the franchise Dewey. Regardless of how far these movies have fallen, David Arquette has always been a reliable mainstay. Also, the scares in this franchise have been reduced to just a bunch of jump scares, both empty and actual. And honestly up until the point that Dewey died, Arquette was the only actor doing anything remotely close to good acting. I can't stress enough how BAD the dialogue was in this movie. It had none of the pop, wit, or humor of the original film. And as bad as the new actors were overall, I think the main actress playing Sam was by far the worst. She delivered her dialogue in the blandest way possible. I couldn't tell if she was mad, happy, or sad. If they are rebooting the franchise with her as the new hero, this is going to be a serious problem as she's nowhere near as good as Neve Campbell. But the actress playing the younger sister wasn't much better. Also, the twins, who I thought were the killers to begin with, actually survived somehow. I smell them being the killer duo in the next film as I predicted in this film. My prediction is pretty much the only thing that would even make me watch the next one.",unnecessary sequel reboot,scream 2022 is movie that feels totally unnecessary its film full interchangeable generic gen z actors continuing drag all older ones back into dying franchise first filmmakers really need learn timeline new bland main character sam says that after events original film copycat murders occurred about every decade so lets see 1996 1998 2000 2011 2022 yeah thats every decade lol next how is sam full 5 years older than her sister group friends when she looks same age as them shes supposed be like early 20s they all look early 20s sams age doesnt line up billy got her mother pregnant died 1996 so she should be at least 26 but movie says shes 5 years older than her sister who cant be more than 17 which makes sam 22 next they cast most forgettable group actors possible this dialogue humor was incredibly awkward all 21st century social media self aware dialogues were pretentious i dont believe real people interact like this i physically cringed throughout curly haired girls requel monologue even acting within all stab movies they were watching was bad cringe i could have done without couple returning actors too courtney cox is looking rougher with each new scream movie aging blonde actress scream 4 creeps me out with her eternally receding hairline was randys sister married adonis how did that woman manage sire those 2 fashion model looking people then theres lack logic how did sams sister tara miraculously survive opening attack ghostface she didnt look like someone whod just been stabbed multiple times siblings big emotional scene hospital room was such bad acting lacking any kind resonance what father abandons his family daughter that he raised over decade just because he found out she isnt his biological child why is tara holding this against sam her older sister is pouring out her soul her explaining her whole life was turned upside down when she was like pre teen younger sister has zero sympathy why is there no one ever around places where there should be reasonable amount people like hospital reasonably sized small town like woodsboro shouldnt have empty hallways waiting rooms how did it take sam dewey seemingly forever get small town hospital why is police force so oblivious all these murders they know that this town has history serial killers copycats their sheriff key deputies keep getting slaughtered they dont seem care i literally forgot about couple teen characters during chunk film that focused 2 sisters dewey sidney gale when they showed up again after about 40 minutes i was like oh yeah shes this movie fact only 2 side characters i remembered were twins i recall early predicting they were killers i thought sure when mindy joked that she was killer she really wasnt joking turns out person she was making joke was one killers then thats when i knew who her accomplice was especially when he tried divert sams attention towards her sister girl killer was pure cringe trying imitate iconic stu original classic scream 1996 why did chad throw his phone away just wipe blood your jacket so he can work buttons properly characters are stabbed multiple times shot guts somehow still completely lucid walking moving normally afterwards girl gets shot 3 times point blank range somehow is still alive screaming at top her lungs as shes consumed by fire she should have been dead gunshots not fire also turns out she still wasnt dead got be shot head because this franchise is utterly dumb at this point unless youre shot head no matter how maimed you are other vital parts your body you can fully function with no problem too many talking killers just kill your prey get it over with writers try somehow redeem billy loomis as hero afterlife as ghost muse his illegitimate daughter then they kill off my absolute favorite character franchise dewey regardless how far these movies have fallen david arquette has always been reliable mainstay also scares this franchise have been reduced just bunch jump scares both empty actual honestly up until point that dewey died arquette was only actor doing anything remotely close good acting i cant stress enough how bad dialogue was this movie it had none pop wit or humor original film as bad as new actors were overall i think main actress playing sam was by far worst she delivered her dialogue blandest way possible i couldnt tell if she was mad happy or sad if they are rebooting franchise with her as new hero this is going be serious problem as shes nowhere near as good as neve campbell but actress playing younger sister wasnt much better also twins who i thought were killers begin with actually survived somehow i smell them being killer duo next film as i predicted this film my prediction is pretty much only thing that would even make me watch next one,0.4616781165694208,0.05119580902189599,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,Elevated slasher,"Right off the bat I have to say, this is about as perfect of a sequel as I can remember. I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, except the parts where my jaw dropped. High-quality filmmaking all around.They managed to make a fresh new entry in the franchise while somehow keeping the same feel as the originals. Everything feels natural, nothing feels forced. You would think the meta aspect is old by now, but nothing is old if it's done well. It has one of the most meta scenes in movie history, and I loved it. It's funny, awesome and creepy, constantly keeping you at the edge of your seat.I can't believe I'm saying this, but this fifth entry in the franchise is my favorite. I liked them all except for Scream 3, but this feels better in so many ways.The writing is extremely clever, to the point where it feels like they're toying with the audience, and the audience likes it! No more stupid character decisions like the previous sequels. In fact, there are numerous moments where the characters do the smartest thing possible.But what's the biggest improvement? The kills in this movie are all brutal. If there was a Scream kills ranking, this movie would have almost every top spot. It made me so happy (what does that say about me? Lol).I had a blast with this movie. I can't wait to watch it again. Other writers, directors and studios need to study this case and apply it to all future sequel attempts. This is how it's done.Edit: I watched it again before it left Ultrascreen. I had the entire theater to myself :)When it comes to mysteries, you worry that the second time around won't be nearly as good. But I liked it even better. I noticed so many things. All of the brutal kills still made my jaw drop and the big moments still gave me the feels.This movie is so fast-paced. It's almost two hours long but flies by because it's filled with story and kills. I complain about so many movies because not enough happens, there isn't much movie ""substance."" In this movie, stuff happens. A lot.They did an amazing job with making Ghostface such an intimidating presence. Every time Ghostface is on the screen, the movie gives you the feeling, ""yes, it's time to poop your pants.""

4.0,not good,"Didnt know what to expect when going in. Didnt see any trailers since they spoiler so much. I did see a few people praise the movie but still kept my expectation neutral.Going in, the opening scene was underwhelming. This actress is so damn irritating in anything i see her in, and she didn't fail at being a pain in my side through out the movie. Do you know how disappointed i was when i found out this broad was still alive. The only thing decent about the opening was how brutal it was but the bad acting ruined it. The kills were the only positive thing about the movie as whole, ghost face was bad ass and the jumpscares always caught me off guard. Ghost face was literally the only good thing about this, because every character in this was LAME. I honest to god did not like anyone. It was difficult to root for anyone. The leading lady was one dimensional, her sister was annoying and a bad actress, her friends were wack and forgettable, sidney prescott was an after thought. The only exception was the car scene with the guy wanting to leave town, and forget the inhaler.Why did they bring back billy loomis as an imaginary friend/ghost and basically make him a hero. Why did they give billy loomis a daughter. The killer reveal was underwhleiming, and the motive was stupid and lazy. It was so dumb and random and added no depth to the series. And the part where the girl came back to life after catching fire was goofy.They should have made the black girl the killer cause there was one scene in the basement that could have been unsettling but the potential was taken away. The whole movie was just characters cracking jokes about who was or wasn't the killer, and when you finally find who it is its a letdown. And their ''motive'' makes it even worse.",not good,didnt know what expect when going didnt see any trailers since they spoiler so much i did see few people praise movie but still kept my expectation neutral going opening scene was underwhelming this actress is so damn irritating anything i see her she didnt fail at being pain my side through out movie do you know how disappointed i was when i found out this broad was still alive only thing decent about opening was how brutal it was but bad acting ruined it kills were only positive thing about movie as whole ghost face was bad ass jumpscares always caught me off guard ghost face was literally only good thing about this because every character this was lame i honest god did not like anyone it was difficult root anyone leading lady was one dimensional her sister was annoying bad actress her friends were wack forgettable sidney prescott was after thought only exception was car scene with guy wanting leave town forget inhaler why did they bring back billy loomis as imaginary friend ghost basically make him hero why did they give billy loomis daughter killer reveal was underwhleiming motive was stupid lazy it was so dumb random added no depth series part where girl came back life after catching fire was goofy they should have made black girl killer cause there was one scene basement that could have been unsettling but potential was taken away whole movie was just characters cracking jokes about who was or wasnt killer when you finally find who it is its letdown their motive makes it even worse,0.6439488636363636,-0.17275568181818185,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.31}"
4.0,Not at all in the same league as the original movies.,"But better than Scream 4, for going exactly where it wanted to. The criticism on the horror genre is clumsy. The kills are not very inventive, and some of it are disappointing and unrealistic. How can you survive so many stab wounds?!... The drama felt a lot like a soap opera. And the shocking death, really got me, until the next scene. The new cast is dull, and if it wasn't for the trilogy characters coming back, you would have no one to really root for. And to be honest, none of them were that worthy. The acting is overall subpar. Even Courteney Cox, who's used to giving better performances, disappointed me. But it has a lot to do with the material given to her. The killer's reveal and motives are lackluster. And the passionate speech about the genre, felt like white noise and too far fetched. I say the original trilogy remains unscathed, because this new movie is NOTHING like it, and from very different backgrounds. Which shows on several aspects of the script and its protagonists. And the way they talk and interact. But it definitely has enough callbacks and reminders of previous sequels, to escape the harshest of criticisms. It tried something different and similar at the same time. And is the only recent horror movie, I really enjoyed watching, since I don't even know how long. As it is free of any agendas or unnecessary politics. But it unfortunately does not have any of the charm and genuineness of the Craven/Williamson's movies...

2.0,Are you kidding me? It's utter garbage,"So nowadays Hollywood is devoid of ideas, either remakes, new versions or anniversary rehashes seem more common than new films, horrors especially have declined as people seem scared to push the actual limit of what will or won't offend the new weak generation.Scream is a classic, obviously not talking Oscar level etc but it's a classic franchise with a good following and a recognisable legendary mask.This film tries to break the fourth wall like deadpool but if it's possible they're actually in door 74 as it's just cringey self aware nonsense. Explaining why and who and linking it was so lazy, it could've been literally written by a child. It's just not really a new film in the real sense.What's ironic is it isn't clever or witty and it's actually just a bit of a shame, a lot of below par acting, too many cliche acknowledgements to catch out the audience and the same tired super loud sounds to get jump scares rather than doing anything actually scary.The acting was abysmal, the story was a weak re hash trying to appeal to the current stupid generation. The injuries and recovery were inconsistent and ridiculous with who can deal with pain etc.It was really predictable to, it wasn't even a swerve it was like yeah it's obviously you guys, I mean duh!Stop ruining franchises by appealing to a generation who don't appreciate anything and think a hair cut last week was retro. It's weak, disappointing and too self aware to be entertaining.It was slow,dull, predictable, did make a couple of attempts at gory kills but nothing that was creative or dramatic.Do not understand the high score except it was a blast to see ghost face again.Lazy.

I thought sadly movie sucked, ruined half way threw old characters are just props now I know it was to do something different but it brought NOTHING different on table, it was one of worser sequel then to 4th film at least 4th back in 2011 witch I knew movie would suck I didn't see it until at this year before 5th was released, 4th did suck so many reasons. But at least you have comeback with old characters that's its it simple as that before Wes Craven Died, even if Wes was a alive made this movie exact sameway he can't save this movie or at least he would bring up a different idea. Everyone likes and loves this movie is because it's a Reunion from first film, it's a Nostalgia witch means bringing back the past from first film that's why everyone loved it then somehow in trailer got 4 stars???? 4 stars for this crap I don't know how in earth this made so much money in Box Office, I don't even freaking how in earth this got pass???? What was soo Great about this 5th film?? It felt too rushed, story felt very rushed, it was lazy suspense, lazy ideas all it did was just a redo from first Scream film all over again with all this Reunion expect you have characters Related from first one that's it.

Story does still follows from 2011 4th Scream film Tara Carpenter (Jenna Ortega) was home alone staying at Kitchen as always then a strange phone call happens then she hangs up gets threat text messages, if she doesn't pick up or hangs up her friend will Die then she got attacked by Ghostface and she survives I givethat credit and it is something different to table to that because in every opening of Scream movies at start of film they just Die but at least in this one made it different Tara Survives, you have an older estranged sister Sam Carpenter (Melissa Barrera) finds out that in files or Boxes she Discovered that Billy Loomis from very, first Scream film is her father Sam then tells Tara that Billy is her biological father after discovering the truth years prior, which resulted in their parents separation and why Sam became estranged from her.She's been dealing with hallucinations of Billy Loomis witch she sees him in her vision anywhere in mirror looking like same character from 1st character but expect he aged a bit doesn't look any younger at all... you have other characters that were related to character Randy from 1st and 2nd film Mindy Meeks-Martin (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Mason Gooding (Chad Meeks-Martin) as in they have Uncle Randy you have relatives from Randy those characters I never cared about, you have Wes Hicks (Dylan Minnette) related to other character from Scream 4 as the son to Sheriff Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton) from 4th Scream becomes Sheriff now in moment you will be surprised what happened to them in half way of movie that was something different. You have Richie Kirsch (Jack Quaid) as boyfriend to Sam character, Amber Freeman (Mikey Madison) known for Once upon time in Hollywood plays the Susan ""Sadie"" Atkins one of Charlie Manson killers play's in this movie. You have original characters back Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), Dewey Riley (David Arquette), Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) back in film but they don't appear like in middle of movie they are just sadly used and wasted like props. Your lead character is Sam Carpenter with her boyfriend trying to find out why is Ghostface is after her. In this movie is just stupid it's like what is happening nowadays scene where you have Randy Niece Mindy talking about requels, sequels like Terminator, Ghostbusters, Jurassic Park everything you name. You have Dewey back but not in good way he play's a loser, living in trailer, has a put on weight has put on gut, so writers just made him like a loser you have 1 scene with him and Gale, you have that score song from 2nd scream film Hans Zimmer theme from Broken Arrow film staying as Nostalgic as it canyou will be Disappointment what happened to Dewey he gets killed off completely he doesn't survive I am like??? You didn't need to kill off Dewey just to shock audience other characters survived stabs a lot of times they get brutally stabbed like you thought they were Dead already but they weren't new characters can live they got stabbed a lot of times but Dewey nah he has to Die off to shock everyone because they out of ideas?? That's different??? Just because it's different doesn't mean it's always good, you want something different for this 5th crap make Dewey as lead and Sidney as cameo kill off Gale have Dewey go out for revenge... that's it simple that's different or kill off Sidney if your out of ideas Directors or writers... I reckon it shocked enough when they killed off Wes Hicks and Sheriff Judy Hicks that was shocking she got more times then to Dewey. Threw out film you have same house, same place like in first one house party, samething someone goes by themselves in basement to get Beers, you see miles and miles and miles awayAmber Freeman is the Killer I saw that miles away from beginning of movie I knew she was killer of how shifty she was and how she was acting staff like that I knew she was killer, I knew Sam boyfriend is killer before they got to House from first film. It's tattooed to Amber head killer she looks like a freaky killer. You have same moments where Mindy is sitting and watching first Scream does samething like what Randy does look behind you, while Ghostface slowly comes behind Randy but it does that Mindy I doubt Scream 6 they will kill off Mindy or Chad in next sequel.... and movie ends sameway like 1st film did, same jump scene with jumpscene then play's roll credits showing actors names with footage from 5th film. Unbelievable how ruined it is, how lazy it is even title is Scream why don't they call it Scream 5 now it's Scream and Scream ??? If someone is new to watch this franchise they don't even know witch one is witch??? To start with it would be funny if someone starts to watch this movie then person gets surprised this is sequel from past 4 movies... very lazy suspense, lazy character direction, using original characters from 1-4 as cameos as props sadly to say.... if you loved Scream franchise your curious about this movie DON'T EVER SEE IT at all just ended with 3rd film witch is perfect ending and it didn't need no more Scream films after 4th film or 5th film just best to end it with 3rd that's it... if you hated 4th film don't even think about seeing 5th film reason why i wanted to watch it is because i was curious i had free time, and also i was out for friends so yeah saw it for free... even i was lucky don't even spend a dollar until it's out on Netflix.7.1 i wish that was joke.",7 1 rating imdb please do me favor me avoid this garbage,i liked 1 3 scream films i thought their were very good olden days horror films i grew up with i thought first one was just better start fresher classic horror film by wes craven noticing easter eggs any other horror film fantastic 2nd 3rd i liked but now i can deal with those sequels now i thought sadly movie sucked ruined half way threw old characters are just props now i know it was do something different but it brought nothing different table it was one worser sequel then 4th film at least 4th back 2011 witch i knew movie would suck i didnt see it until at this year before 5th was released 4th did suck so many reasons but at least you have comeback with old characters thats its it simple as that before wes craven died even if wes was alive made this movie exact sameway he cant save this movie or at least he would bring up different idea everyone likes loves this movie is because its reunion first film its nostalgia witch means bringing back past first film thats why everyone loved it then somehow trailer got 4 stars 4 stars this crap i dont know how earth this made so much money box office i dont even freaking how earth
