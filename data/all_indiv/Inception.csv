10,A one-of-a-kind mind-blowing masterpiece!,"My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works: Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular ""Nolan's spirit"" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception. SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - ""extractors"" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called ""inception"". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels ""dream within a dream"", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life. Some short lines about the cast: Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.",one kind mind blowing masterpiece,my 3rd time watching this movie yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment left me

10,Insanely Brilliant ! Nolan has outdone himself !!,"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards.",insanely brilliant nolan has outdone himself,what is most resilient parasite idea yes nolan has created something with his unbelievably incredibly god gifted mind which will blow minds audience away world premiere movie directed by hollywoods most inventive dreamers was shown london has already got top notch reviews worldwide has scored maximum points now question arises what movie has that it deserve all this dom cobb di caprio is extractor who is paid invade dreams various business tycoons steal their top secret ideas cobb robs forcefully psyche with practiced skill though hes increasingly haunted by memory his late wife mal marion cotillard who has nasty habit showing up his subconscious wreaking havoc his missions cobb had been involved so much his heist work that he had lost his love but then as fate had decided wealthy business man saito ken watanabe hands over responsibility dissolving empire his business rival robert fischer jr cillian murphy but this time his job was not steal idea but plant new one inceptionthen what happens is classic heist movie tradition carry out task cobbs brainiac specialists team up again with him arthur joseph gordon levitt his longtime organizer tom hardy eames forger who can shapeshift at will yusuf dileep rao powerful sedative supplier there is only one word describe cinematography set designs special effects that is exceptional you dont just watch scenes happening you feel them movie is real thrill ride action scenes are well picturised music by hans zimmer is electronically haunting never runtime movie you will get chance move your eyes screen any other object leonardo who is still popularly known jack dawson played by him titanic should be relieved as his role as dom cobb will be remembered forever his performance may or may not fetch him oscar but it will be his finest performance till date supporting cast too did extraordinary work christopher nolan ah what man he is his work is nothing less than masterpiece he deserves all awards best director category if inception is metaphysical puzzle its also metaphorical one its hard not draw connections between cobbs dream weaving nolans film making intended seduce us mess with our heads leave ever lasting impression conclude i would just say before your life ends do yourself favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by nolan my rating 10 10thanks regards,0.5727122414622414,0.23569925444925438,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"

10,"In a Decade, ""Inception"" May Be A Religion","Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.""Inception"" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the ""Matrix"" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater.",decade inception may be religion,films about dreams subconscious are usually not very straightforward almost always weird inception is no exception that rule but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored contrast between questions what is real what is illusion i e matrix 1999 cell 2000 abre los ojos 1997 its american remake vanilla sky 2001 you really cant look away nor should you inception is excellent breathtaking movie that may be one only films released so far during summer 2010 that lives up its hype it is nearly perfect highly original film that holds your attention until credits roll less you know about this movie going more you will be entranced by seeing it leonardo dicaprio plays dom cobb world class criminal who with help team sleep experts works his way into peoples subconscious steals what people value most ideas directly their minds his last assignment possibly clear his name he is assigned not steal idea someone but plant one inside that persons mind difficulty comes when certain people are trained block their ideas being taken that plot summary only covers basics this pretty complicated story but describe every plot detail would take away magic this film you must see yourself believe dicaprio is good his role but unlike many other films he has starred this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry weight movie his shoulders or share it equally with one other co star instead this great ensemble cast teams together make this movie work just as their characters collaborate pull off such unique heist joseph gordon levitt ellen page tom hardy are especially good their roles special effects this film were also very good which is amazing considering their simplicity compared matrix movies there are slow motion shots but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences its especially interesting when film gets into architecture certain dreams impossible sequences are filmed way ive never seen other than drawings however special effects would mean nothing if story wasnt good this reason even something as simple as spinning top holds your attention way you would never think it would when seeing it this film credit here can be given writer director christopher nolan who has not made bad film yet there are many twists turns this film but nolan never loses his focus process telling story if nolan does not get nominated best director or best original screenplay next oscar season there is something terribly wrong with academy that being said there was still lot about this film i still dont get may require multiple viewings better understand however some best films ive seen are confusing at first 2001 space odyssey 1968 is film ive seen couple times still dont understand completely it still has major following though as im positive this movie will its incredibly entertaining movie but it also makes you think continues do so after you leave theater,0.574043799337917,0.22185852750190982,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"

8,Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.,"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)",sci fi perfection truly mesmerizing film,im nearly at loss words just when you thought christopher nolan couldnt follow up dark knight he does it again delivering another masterpiece one with so much power rich themes

8,Amazingly original...but also a bit overwhelming.,"This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in ""Titanic""--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from ""Third Rock"" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long, complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it, so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many.",amazingly original but also bit overwhelming,this review is being written by 46 year old guy i mention this because clearly this is film where age is important as younger folks probably will enjoy movie more can take fast paced action frenetic pace i assume older audiences probably will be little less amazed bit overwhelmed with film just something consider as you read this as movie ill be up front about fact that i did not love this film its just not sort movie id usually see only went because my oldest daughter nagged me go i am glad i did however as i really could respect movie many ways first story is wildly original though also quite confusing other than matrix films i cant think anything that even comes close it style second production looked sounded great music was intense worked great with amazing totally amazing special effects third it was nice see so many kid actors show that they are not light weights could act leonardo dicaprio is no longer pretty young thing he was titanic his maturity grit were welcome also seeing kid third rock suddenly playing action hero was great youd barely recognize him or other grown child actors fourth i loved ending it really pulled everything together very well so why am i not giving film glowing review well i am simply not action film fan insane pace tons shooting crazy plot simply lost me at times i much preferred slower more introspective moments film also while ken watanabe is fine actor i had devil time understanding lot what he said point where i wish theyd either dubbed him or had caption now this is not just because i am old crank who is slightly hard hearing my daughter too found his thick accent difficult other hand ms cotillard was very easy understand i was surprised how well she controlled her lovely french accent i could probably go about film as its long complex very prone be one watch re watch discuss with friends however at this point there are already bazillion reviews 7 billion people have already gone see it so ill call it day well worth seeing but perhaps too frenetic confusing many,0.5174211938296445,0.13497149564050964,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.28}"

9,Matrix but in dreamworld? Nah.,"I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks.

10,Incredible-Nolan keeps improving and Inception is by far the best improvement!,"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece!

10,Nolan at his most intelligent best.,"Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema.

9,Requires Concentration,"An incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created. Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.Visually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.",requires concentration,incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely intelligent world created whilst extremely complex science allowing story unfold is explained most part although i imagine everyone loses plot first viewing at some point me i was okay until very final saito scene it keeps you engaged throughout i think youre routing right people although reality overarching reason undergo entire film is little weak possibly skimmed over purely vehicle discover world dreams visually it cannot be faulted pairing with music works excellently as well youre constantly drawn into film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing more interesting than compelling having said that it is really one kind at least at this level so everyone should see inception if only appreciate depth nolan went into,0.5813492063492064,0.19010416666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8,"The pieces are amazing, but the whole is ""only"" very good","The pieces of the movie are amazing: 1. Hans Zimmer's music is hauntingly beautiful, probably my favorite movie score ever.2. The premise is unique and fascinating 3. The special effects are amazing and don't distract (unlike some Pierce Brosnan Bond movies). They fit into the plot perfectly.4. The acting is very good.But the assemled pieces make the whole only very good, not amazing: The movie is just too big, and they had to edit it to cut it down to essential info and scenes, resulting in a slightly unnatural flow that feels like trying to drink from a fire hose shoved in your mouth. A mild, subtle infodump feeling arises at times. There are no natural lulls or pauses to digest info. The first time watching you will feel absolutely lost for the first 45 minutes or so unless you read spoilers first, due to a combination of that flow and some out of sequence story telling. The 2nd time watching will be much more enjoyable than the first... it is that lesser enjoyment the first time through that keeps it from being amazing, knocking it down to just very good.

9,This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.,"Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands.

10,The perfect summer blockbuster?,"What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! ""What is the most resilient parasite? An idea"" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around ""Extractors"", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, ""Inception"" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!",perfect summer blockbuster,what do we ask summer blockbuster what is it that incites hysteria this time every year whatever dross studios churn out epic hugeness blowing stuff up romance action heroes what are we looking blockbuster i think it all boils down thrills audiences want thrill car chase thrill romance thrill spectacular if that is case then inception just might be greatest summer blockbuster all time as it also contains something we often dont look brains what is most resilient parasite idea says leonardo di caprios character cobb well inception is all about ideas its all right there title film central idea revolves around extractors who are paid extract secrets peoples subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams usually purpose corporate espionage however when one client asks them plant idea mind their corporate rival inception is born less said about this film better it is full ideas invention each set piece i divulge piece films genius is weakened this is film that cleverly intricately brings audience through several planes existence simultaneously but never allows viewer feel lost such is power christopher nolans script which i imagine is likely get overlooked due sheer visual magnificence his direction but everything that makes this film so great is script ideas everything else is just spectacle this film bears uncanny resemblance thematically with dicaprios other instant classic this year shutter island both films investigate depth tricks traumatised mind can play individual both films are luscious watch both films keep audience firmly outside realm reality however inception is even more layered film than shutter island i believe sci fi genre setting will prove be less alienating audiences than prison noir scorseses film there is not single dull moment nolans film there is style charm intelligence every frame film every performance is pitch perfect with some strong support by ellen page joseph gordon levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars leonardo dicaprio gives typically flawless performance as muddled grieving man who we never quite trust be living real world best part inception is large amount effects which were done camera while film does make use cgi there are some pretty mind blowing practical effects which are as simple as camera telling beautiful lies rare treat these days this is blockbuster that ticks all boxes smart sexy femme fatale sexy brainy girl very beautiful men very beautiful suits magical inception is kind film that reminds me why cinema will never die because anyone who thinks its ok watch this film laptop or ipad is fool this is pure cinema proud it not be missed big screen,0.5415761626287942,0.2816276803118908,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"

9,Intellectual masterpiece,"Inception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry. With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.Inceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.The director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.The acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn't win an Oscar for his performance.Meanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.To finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I've seen. With a thought-provoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable ending.I highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you won't be disappointed.",intellectual masterpiece,inception is beautiful piece film that has impacted large part film industry with everything actors cinematography music this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is inceptions slow start is only weak point this movie it begins intensely then slows down next 20 30 minutes while then finishing off as impeccable film nevertheless this is what brings film down me director christopher nolan managed create masterpiece with little no mistakes at no point during this intensely long movie did i feel bored instead i was always excited my toes intrigued acting this movie was phenomenal small number great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances it is truly beyond me how dicaprio didnt win oscar his performance meanwhile also employing greatest composer history with hans zimmer music adds significantly music adds extreme amount excitement keeps you constantly interested few composers can make you notice music but zimmer succeeds per usual finish film was astonishingly shot with beautiful eye catching scenes while also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some best action ive seen with thought provoking storyline that finishes with unbelievable ending i highly recommend inception everyone i promise you wont be disappointed,0.5841144527986634,0.2283072263993316,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10,Didn't win Best Picture? WHAT?,"Inception is as original as you can get with a sci-fi movie. I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn't enough, watching it twice isn't enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly film-making at it's greatest! It is one of the most re-watch-able movies a director has ever put out! It's like Dark Knight, Memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again.At times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it's the real world when it is actually the dream world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, oh my god! In my opinion it is his greatest performance. And Inception SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Fun fact: This film got nominated for Best Screenplay and many other Oscar nominations, yet they don't nominate the man who put it all together who DIRECTED THE GOSH-DARN MASTERPIECE!I watch this film at least twice a week and to see that Watchmojo put Social Network higher than Inception on their Top 10 Movies of the Decade list p*sses me off! Yeah, it's David Fincher, I get that Watchmojo love David Fincher, but higher than Inception? NAH!If anybody else directed this it would be an average, unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work. When Nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original, classic and everything great about movies. I'd place this on my top 5 films of the century list, most films on that list would include Nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that.More will be added soon...",didnt win best picture what,inception is as original as you can get with sci fi movie i feel like its kind pointless compare this blade runner aliens terminator 2 2001 space odyssey or any other sci fi blockbusters theyre completely different what nolan crafted is genius my mind he is still yet make bad movie it is now time get into spoiler territory inception is story about dreams how you can build anything you want nolan took 10 years write screenplay it was definitely worth while this is one most mind blowing nail biting epic action packed science fiction movies all time all performances this film are amazing special effects are flawless acting is flawless story is flawless writing is flawless this is one few pictures that just got everything right all categories most people saw there is no such thing as flawless movie i would 100 love disagree with them there all christopher nolan movies i have seen so far have no real flaws leonardo dicaprio christopher nolan pure gold these two should definitely collaborate more inception just proves that chris is cinematic god his screenplays his production his film direction everything is perfect you have imagine it believe it watching it once isnt enough watching it twice isnt enough you have got watch this 10 times or even more really get true essence why this movie is considered be one greatest all time it is truly film making at its greatest it is one most re watch able movies director has ever put out its like dark knight memento most his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again at times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like its real world when it is actually dream world leonardo dicaprios performance oh my god my opinion it is his greatest performance inception should have won best picture fun fact this film got nominated best screenplay many other oscar nominations yet they dont nominate man who put it all together who directed gosh darn masterpiece i watch this film at least twice week see that watchmojo put social network higher than inception their top 10 movies decade list p sses me off yeah its david fincher i get that watchmojo love david fincher but higher than inception nah if anybody else directed this it would be average unoriginal completely unimaginative piece work when nolan gets his hands something it is always going be original classic everything great about movies id place this my top 5 films century list most films that list would include nolan films because he is best director working today you have accept that more will be added soon,0.5065306122448978,0.34903061224489806,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date","Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",potpourri vestiges review bu uel meets kubrick nolans most ambitious venture till date,surrealism can appear be ineffably bizarre or inquisitively titillating depending purely viewers intellect though realm surrealism is highly nebulous complex but even slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry open pandoras box making task highly improbable nigh impossible this facet reality may pose handicap most gifted directors but not genius christopher nolan who not only dabbles with concept surrealism but also ingeniously blends it with elements science fiction his latest wonder named inception nolan created niche himself decade back by unleashing monster movie called memento he further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like insomnia prestige batman begins dark knight his unremitting desire innovation uncanny craving foray into unexplored realms imagination deservedly earned him auteur tag which gave him carte blanche that story teller like nolan desperately needs its highly apparent that nolan takes every possible advantage this liberty while filming inception inception is not only dreamlike but is dream itself is superior any other thing conceived silver screen with its entwined layers movie most part serves as unfathomable riddle makes multiple viewing extremely essential it incredibly does extremely well both humanistic as well as technical fronts fact balance between human emotions elements science fiction is so adequate that its impossible separate them movie is about futuristic world where human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion cobb is expert art extracting information stealing valuable secrets deep within subconscious dream state his proficiency extraction is marred by turmoil that begins with his wifes untimely death he is forced live life fugitive away his children his only chance redemption lies with japanese tycoon named saitu who wants him do inception planting information into someones mind order accomplish this unprecedented task cobb his team must overcome labyrinth unforeseeable challenges where even slight miss could trap them perpetual limbo any further revelation would be remissness my part as plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable justifying its profundity leonardo dicaprio gives solid performance lead role following his memorable performance shutter island he has brilliantly depicted complexities limitations cobbs enigmatic character highlighting his pain mental trauma marion cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as cobbs whimsical wife mal rest cast has given thorough performance with special mention ken watanabe ellen page joseph gordon levitt inception is incredibly brilliant as movie is breakthrough contemporary cinema nolans creativity his unparalleled execution definitely make it object great cachet but whether it would become bu uels un chien andalou or kubricks 2001 space odyssey serve as prototype movies come is time decide irrespectively inception is sine qua non not only aficionado but also average viewer who is willing delve deep enough savour delight ps one has imagine it believe it 9 10,0.5557105064247922,0.11843056414484986,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.52}"
5,Inception? More Like Insipid,"""Inception"" might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of ""The Prestige"" with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like ""The Dark Knight"") suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. ""Inception"" is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-",inception more like insipid,inception might have been better movie would certainly have been more entertaining had writer director christopher nolan not made his premise so complicated that film had spend its entire 2 25 running time explaining itself its audience seriously exposition never stops there were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause explain what was going another character which course was ham fisted way explaining it us but even with all that aggressive exposition movie never does make lot sense result is lot busyness oh theres always plenty stuff going thats nevertheless pretty boring because its never clear what all busyness is nolan has done this us before who hell came out prestige with any clue what that movie was about even his more narratively coherent films like dark knight suffer lack humor burden philosophical pondering that premises cant support inception is no exception ha movie is junk trying disguise itself as something important significant how much more fun it would have been if it had just been content be junk grade c,0.5860714285714285,0.15529761904761905,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.39}"
