10.0,A question of taste,"A number of interest points here. A brilliant premise. Material that was daring at the time, that one is amazed at what it got away with even if some of it may be an acquired taste. That it was the final film of the lovely Carole Lombard, who died far too young in a plane crash not long after with much more to give. And that it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch, a personal favourite of mine who had one of the most distinctive directing styles for any director often cited as ""the Lubtisch touch"".Found 'To Be or Not to Be' a truly fabulous film, have seen many very good to masterpiece films recently (as well as inevitably some duds) and this stands out among the very best of them. What could easily have been tasteless and offensive, with what it was satirising and considering the time, turned out to be one of the funniest comedies seen recently and ever actually and wartime comedies have seldom been funnier or more original. It also contains some of the best work of all involved. In front of and behind the camera, am aware that sounds very cliched but to me it's true.'To Be or Not to Be' looks great, immaculately yet atmospherically designed with a real sense of period and beautifully shot without being too glamorous. The music is neither too jaunty or low key, while Lubitsch's direction is one of 'To Be or Not to Be's' biggest stars in its sophisticated style that one can recognise from anywhere.Regarding the script, it is intricate and full of sharp wit and hilariously quotable lines that as mentioned above in my first paragraph when talking about the material being daring. The opening gag is hysterical and one that one does not expect, while the running joke concerning Robert Stack as Maria's (played by Lombard) admirer is an example of a running joke that doesn't get old prematurely and doesn't get repetitive, dangers with running jokes. 'To Be or Not to Be' is not just non-stop hilarity though, there is also surprising pathos that one doesn't always get in comedy and is genuinely poignant. Affectionate and inspiring are further things to describe and never had any problem with the pace.Lubitsch's direction is one of two particularly wonderful things about 'To Be or Not to Be'. The other is the simply sublime cast, showing Jack Benny at his funniest and Lombard being an absolute joy in all senses (found her touching too but a lot of it was to do with it being her final film and what a talent she was). Stack is amusing and charming and Stanley Ridges and Sig Ruman are great fun.Altogether, fabulous. Even in films that fit in the ""loved it"" category, improvements can be pointed out in order to be balanced, but in the case of 'To Be or Not to Be' there is nothing to fault. 10/10",question taste,number interest points here brilliant premise material that was daring at time that one is amazed at what it got away with even if some it may be acquired taste that it was final film lovely carole lombard who died far too young plane crash not long after with much more give that it was directed by ernst lubitsch personal favourite mine who had one most distinctive directing styles any director often cited as lubtisch touch found be or not be truly fabulous film have seen many very good masterpiece films recently as well as inevitably some duds this stands out among very best them what could easily have been tasteless offensive with what it was satirising considering time turned out be one funniest comedies seen recently ever actually wartime comedies have seldom been funnier or more original it also contains some best work all involved front behind camera am aware that sounds very cliched but me its true be or not be looks great immaculately yet atmospherically designed with real sense period beautifully shot without being too glamorous music is neither too jaunty or low key while lubitschs direction is one be or not bes biggest stars its sophisticated style that one can recognise anywhere regarding script it is intricate full sharp wit hilariously quotable lines that as mentioned above my first paragraph when talking about material being daring opening gag is hysterical one that one does not expect while running joke concerning robert stack as marias played by lombard admirer is example running joke that doesnt get old prematurely doesnt get repetitive dangers with running jokes be or not be is not just non stop hilarity though there is also surprising pathos that one doesnt always get comedy is genuinely poignant affectionate inspiring are further things describe never had any problem with pace lubitschs direction is one two particularly wonderful things about be or not be other is simply sublime cast showing jack benny at his funniest lombard being absolute joy all senses found her touching too but lot it was do with it being her final film what talent she was stack is amusing charming stanley ridges sig ruman are great fun altogether fabulous even films that fit loved it category improvements can be pointed out order be balanced but case be or not be there is nothing fault 10 10,0.6175656814449918,0.2964367816091953,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,The Nazis have never been mocked better,"Comedies rarely stand the test of time - this one does: one of the funniest films I have ever seen.When I was 16 (20 years ago, sigh...), this was re-released for a short time in a local art-house cinema, and my father insisted I go watching it with a friend. Well, teenagers don't normally line up to see 50 year old black and white comedies, but - man, was I glad I did!This is a pitch black comedy that feels as fresh today as it must have then; in fact, this must have been kind of a shock in 1942. There are no cheesy clean characters or cringe-worthy lines: this is a firework of fast, witty dialogue with an edge and the sexiest, cleverest (and most morally ambiguous) female protagonist I have ever seen in a film before the ""New Hollywod"" era.Even the structure and the way the story evolves are very modern; there are flashbacks and twists and turns that might be very common in contemporary films but must have seemed almost ""avant-garde"" at the time.The biggest fun, of course, is how Lubitsch takes the pi** out of Hitler's blind, fanatic followers. I don't believe the Nazis have ever been mocked better than in this comedy masterpiece (and I only hope old Adolf has seen it, too). Mel Brooks' remake is not bad, but the original is simply killer.

9.0,An indecent masterpiece,"As Adolf Hitler starts ravaging Europe, a polish theatrical Nazi-satire is cancelled, the day of the very first performance. Nevertheless, while Poland is invaded by the Nazi army, the same theatrical team, with the same German soldier costumes, will deliver the best play of their entire career in order to thwart the actions of a spy.This cinematographic gem directed by Ernst Lubitsch is built on a solid script, exquisite dialogues, and outstanding actors, especially Jack Benny, Carole Lombard and Sig Ruman. For obvious reasons, this indecent movie was initially coldly received: a comedy about world war II during world war II. This bitterness and/or bewilderment probably explains the blatant lack of nominations to the main Oscar categories. However, nowadays, we only remember the genius.In bulk, ones of my favorite quotes: May I have your autograph, Mr Bronski? So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt? To be or not to be. If we should ever have a baby, I'm not so sure I'd be the mother. They named a brandy after Napoleon, they made a herring out of Bismarck, and the Fuhrer is going to end up as a piece of cheese! Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg? Hey, wait a minute, you go to the hotel and I'll cross my fingers. I'm a good Pole and I love my country and I love my slippers.

8.0,"Fiction can make fun of reality, that's the revenge of reason over barbarity...","""To Be or Not To Be"" doesn't trivialize the barbarity of the Nazi regime as much as it ennobles art and gives an aura of metaphysical importance to laughter, as the main characteristic of the reasonable person. It's precisely because Ernst Lubitsch could laugh at the Nazism that one shouldn't underestimate the sadness and terror that devoured his soul. One could say the same about Chaplin's ""Great Dictator"", more focused on the inner heroism of the little people while Lubitsch' movie is a love letter to artists, and the work of a true one.Lubitsch grew up in Berlin and became an acting sensation after World War I before becoming one of the most promising directors of Hollywood. A precocious talent with a sense of sophistication that would be known as the 'Lubitsch touch', he was probably under the influence of that boost of creativity and flamboyance that made Berlin an artistic Mecca in the early 30s (like in Bob Fosse's ""Cabaret""). His film opens on Warsaw, a more suitable place for free art once Germany surrendered to swastikas. And as if he anticipated the criticism over his subject, the story features a play named ""The Gestapo"" and satirizing the Nazis. During a rehearsal, the man playing Hitler (Irish actor Tom Dugan) delivers a hilarious and unexpected ""Heil myself"". The line gets cut by the director who makes it a matter of ethics not to make Nazis funny, much to the actor's reluctance.Basically, Lubitsch asks us the question: should we sacrifice a good line for the sake of seeming decency? How many times haven't we felt the necessity to cross the barrier of good taste because it was so tempting. So the line is censored because of the risk of offending Hitler and when the Germans come on a day of September 1939, the play is cancelled once and for all. The situation resonates like Churchill's parable about war and dishonour, fearing the Nazis is the dishonourable attitude, even when meant to play safe, you're never safe with them, so let's just use your best weapon, guns or gags it doesn't matter. While I was wondering if Lubitsch would have been as loose on the Nazis if he knew about the Camps, I was hiding a chuckle because the line ""so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt"" kept springing to my mind. Should I feel guilty?No less than for any movie that dared to turn the subject into laughing matter, from Donald Duck's ""Der Fuerher's Face"" to ""La Vita e Bella"". It's because Nazis were human that their crimes were horrific, it's because they were human that they should be mocked. Art is the triumph of the intellect over the brutal force, the sensitivity over cynicism, it can be sophisticated and fancy but it can't really do without powerful sentiments, this is why the film makes a good use of Shakespeare's lines (borrowed from ""Hamlet"" and ""The Merchant of Venice"") and even more why it focuses on a married couple, the greatest actress of Poland Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) and her hammy husband Joseph (Jack Benny). The film opens with a sort of vaudevillian mood where Maria exploits her husband's ""Hamlet"" soliloquy to bring the handsome aviator Sobinski (Robert Starck) to her room, the running gag is not overused so Marie doesn't appear too cheap and Joseph too dumb.There's a fine balance between the romance and the screwball situations and they all get along with the intricacies of a plot that involves a sinister but seductive spy named Professor Siletski (Stanley Ridges), who proposes Maria to become an agent. Meanwhile, the troop must absolutely capture the man, confiscate the documents that contain names of Polish Resistant members and get rid of the spy, and this is where their Nazi costumes get quite handy. So we see Jack benny and all his friends impersonating Nazi officers and even Selitski with variable effects, sometimes with the right timing, sometimes a delay force them to rewrite the script. In a sort of meta-referential nod to his own art, Lubitsch directs actors playing directors, actors and writers, proving that sometimes a good act can be a matter of life and death. Hammy too much and your cover is blown if not your head. Maria proves to be a more restrained actress so she can dodge the Nazis' flair, same can't be said about Joseph and Benny's antics endanger the film's credibility in their exaggerated audacity, the man pushes his luck so often it's a wonder how he did survive.The film also suffers from a series of contrivances that happen all too conveniently near the end leading to a rushed climax only redeemed by the hilarious ending. Still, the real black spot in the film's legacy is of course the haunting of Carole Lombard's memory. The actress died in a plane crash a few weeks after the film's release, the USA had just entered the war and she was collecting bonds during a tour across America. In a way, she was a victim of that war though she lived far from the ruins and ashes of Poland, her death cut one of the most promising careers short and made Gable so inconsolable he joined the war too... I avoided that film for a long time because of that story, it had saddened me a lot even more because I happen to be afraid of flying.I couldn't believe how many times she referred to flights during the film, the simple fact that she loved an aviator gives it an eerie feeling, it's just as if the film was doomed to be clouded by tragedy, individual and universal. However, and that might be the secret of ""To Be or Not to Be"", It's all fiction, it's not reality, the film was criticized when the war was still raging and now it's a classic, once reality is as dead as fiction, what remains is the essence of art.as",fiction can make fun reality thats revenge reason over barbarity,be or not be doesnt trivialize barbarity nazi regime as much as it ennobles art

,Witty and mocking,"Joseph Tura and his wife are part of an actors troop in pre-WW2 Poland. When a handsome young pilot is forced to break off his affair with Mrs Tura to go to England and join the RAF, he sends a message through an English agent who offers to take messages to families of all the pilots when he goes to Poland. Realising too late that Professor Siletsky is a double agent taking addresses to the Nazi's, Lt Sobinski alerts Tura who is forced to play several roles to try and outwit the Nazi's and protect the underground resistance.Despite having heard it mentioned (and avoided the remake) I had still never seen this film until earlier today. I wasn't sure what to expect as I knew that it had been made during the war and that it's humour might not seem as mocking or sharp today. However I was surprised how funny it actually was while it also dealt with the Nazi issue at the same time. The mocking tone of the film is balanced nicely by a real vein of wit with sharp word play all around. The plot is kept ticking over by this humour until Tura is able to drive the film by his many performances!The Nazi's are mocked without taking away from the horrors of what they were. The cast are what really makes the film work for me though. Although he takes second billing, I can't help but feel that Benny is the star of the film as he has all the best characters and the lion's share of the lines. Lombard does very well indeed and shows a real ability for quick witty lines  the fact that she died in a plane crash leaving this her last movie should be considered a great loss. The whole support cast, whether Polish actor or German commander, all play very well managing to bring both wit and pathos to the film.Overall a film that is not as uncomfortable to watch as I suspected it might have been, in fact one that is downright hilarious at times and has all the sharpness and wit that I want in a comedy.

10.0,One of the great romantic/satirical comedies of all time,"There is a famous review of this film by the late Sunday Times critic, Dilys Powell which begins 'Is the joke funny?'... what Miss Powell was getting at was that, given the horror of the Holocaust, it is appropriate to laugh at the Nazis. The answer is, ultimately, irrelevant to the viewing of this modest masterpiece.Lubitsch was, by this time, coming to the end of an exquisite career that defined the nature of sophistication in 'light' cinema. 'To Be or Not To Be' skips lightly over all of the minefield of a subject like this and it is difficult or impossible to think of any other filmmaker who might have managed it (if you look at Mel Brooks' limp remake, you can see why).In 1996, I presented a massive season of 'the greatest' films in Belfast for the centenary of cinema - 250 titles in 9 months. Of all of them, this was the film which got the greatest ovation - about 5 minutes with a nearly full house standing and applauding! They may have applauded for many reasons, but here are certainly some of them...The very complicated narrative is presented virtually flawlessly and the comedy is never allowed to hold up the narrative. The principle actors - Carole Lombard (breathtakingly beautiful) and Jack Benny in particular, but many of the supporting cast as well - throw themselves into the affair with a gusto that is completely infectious. Apart from the satirical aspect of the story and the way in which Hitler and the Nazis are mercilessly ridiculed for their authoritarianism and the fear which is their only motivator, the film pokes gentle fun at the vanity of actors in a warm and happy manner. Finally, and most important, is the notion of farce. Farce rarely works in the cinema, but here it does, and in the grand manner - just look at how many times the situation regarding Professor Siletsky changes profoundly during the film - it is dizzying - yet the characters manage to come up with (often self-defeating or inappropriate) schemes on every occasion.This is a wonderful work that, I have no hesitation in saying, is absolutely vital for anyone who wants to really understand the glory of the cinema. But to answer Dilys Powell's question... yes, the joke is deliriously funny.",one great romantic satirical comedies all time,there is famous review this film by late sunday times critic dilys powell which begins is joke funny what miss powell was getting at was that given horror holocaust it is appropriate laugh at nazis answer is ultimately irrelevant viewing this modest masterpiece lubitsch was by this time coming end exquisite career that defined nature sophistication light cinema be or not be skips lightly over all minefield subject like this it is difficult or impossible think any other filmmaker who might have managed it if you look at mel brooks limp remake you can see why 1996 i presented massive season greatest films belfast centenary cinema 250 titles 9 months all them this was film which got greatest ovation about 5 minutes with nearly full house standing applauding they may have applauded many reasons but here are certainly some them very complicated narrative is presented virtually flawlessly comedy is never allowed hold up narrative principle actors carole lombard breathtakingly beautiful jack benny particular but many supporting cast as well throw themselves into affair with gusto that is completely infectious apart satirical aspect story way which hitler nazis are mercilessly ridiculed their authoritarianism fear which is their only motivator film pokes gentle fun at vanity actors warm happy manner finally most important is notion farce farce rarely works cinema but here it does grand manner just look at how many times situation regarding professor siletsky changes profoundly during film it is dizzying yet characters manage come up with often self defeating or inappropriate schemes every occasion this is wonderful work that i have no hesitation saying is absolutely vital anyone who wants really understand glory cinema but answer dilys powells question yes joke is deliriously funny,0.6992468415937804,0.23481535471331386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.4}"
7.0,"""Wait a minute. I'll decide with whom my wife is gonna have dinner and who she's gonna kill!""","I was genuinely shocked when the movie began to see Jack Benny in a Nazi uniform and thought how inappropriate that casting decision was, right until it was revealed he was taking part in a documentary on Nazi Germany. So with a sigh of relief, I settled back to enjoy this humorous treatment with Carole Lombard portraying Benny's wife as the couple, Joseph and Maria Tura, became part of the Polish underground in 1939 Warsaw, right on the brink of World War II. I always wonder how films like this might have been received by audiences of the time, realizing that war was imminent, and whether or not the viewing public had reservations about seeing a film treating such a serious topic with humor. In director Ernst Lubitsch's case, he handled the issue with a unique balance of political satire, romance, slapstick and wartime suspense, and if anything, the picture might be even better received today than back in the era in which it was made.Third billed in the film is Robert Stack as a Polish soldier infatuated with Maria Tura, thereby creating a bit of tension for Jack Benny's character in the early going. This situation ultimately turns to naught as Benny assumes a variety of impersonations to foil messages being carried by a German spy to Nazi headquarters. I was a fan of Jack Benny, mostly during his 1950's television show era, and it's uncanny how he affects so many of his typical stage gestures and mannerisms as an actor, along with the recognizable speech pattern. Not to mention the way he obsesses over his 'greatness' as an actor, another aspect of his comic persona. As someone of Polish descent myself, I kept a watchful eye on all of the English to Polish translations utilized in the film and they were handled pretty well. Things like notices at the Polish Theater and gender postings on the restroom doors. I only mention that because I got the biggest kick out of being able to read them. The picture probably could have thrown in a few standard colloquialisms to good effect, but I didn't notice any.If you like this film's subject matter, that is, a mocking comic treatment of the wartime Nazi regime, you might also look up another film from 1942 that takes place on American soil. It's called ""All Through the Night"", and has a cast headed by Humphrey Bogart and Conrad Veidt, dealing with Broadway gamblers who turn patriotic when they stumble onto a cell of Nazi saboteurs.

10.0,Swan Song in Warsaw,"In 1940 the American public was shocked when Charlie Chaplin released his first all talkie movie THE GREAT DICTATOR, in which he lampooned Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Despite the new European war, we were yet still at peace with both Axis states. Hollywood, with rare exceptions (BLOCKADE, CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY, ESCAPE) had been gingerly tackling the Nazis and Fascists. Yet public reaction to THE GREAT DICTATOR was odd. It had a big box office success, and yet many were appalled because it chose to say Hitler could be laughed at. Chaplin's response was that if he had been laughed at to begin with he would never have become such a threat.Actually other voices were beginning to stir in Hollywood. One was the great comedy director Ernst Lubitsch, who poked an occasional jab at the Nazis. Lubitsch had to wait until 1941 for a full assault on the Nazis - TO BE OR NOT TO BE, a film that looked at the German invasion of Poland, and it's occupation of Warsaw. It had an interesting cast. The lead went to Carole Lombard, who had many comedy performances under her belt. She played Maria Tura, the leading lady (and wife) of ""that great actor"" (as he always prefaces his remarks) Joseph Tura. Joseph is Jack Benny.Of all the leading men in her career, Lombard never played opposite one who was really more of a star in a different medium. Typical co-stars for Lombard were John Barrymore, Fred MacMurray, Cary Grant, Ralph Bellamy, William Powell, Robert Montgomery, Clark Gable, and Fredric March. Here it was Benny, who while he had a string of movie credits was basically a radio comedy star (and later would be a television star). His best films (GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE, ARTISTS AND MODELS, CHARLIE'S AUNT) were not record breakers at the box office. In fact, while his performances were good in these, he did not necessarily shine in them (Laird Cregar, in one simple moment in CHARLIE'S AUNT, got the biggest laugh of the film). Nobody realized that his performance as Joseph Tura would be his best one, and that within two years he'd make his final starring fiasco in THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT.Benny and Lombard proved to work well together as the egotistical, but oddly loving couple of theater hams. In fact the actors making up the Tura company are all good, including Lionel Atwill (who briefly is seen playing Claudius to Benny's Hamlet), Felix Bressart as Greenberg (who dreams of doing the Shylock speech from THE MERCHANT OF VENICE), Tom Dugan as Bronski (who hopes to play Hitler on the stage), Charles Halton as Dubosch (the stage manager, and the head of the Warsaw underground), and Maude Eburne as Lombard's cynical maid Anna. The screenplay did give plenty of time showing the difficulties and tensions of a stage company working together, and of handling temperamental stars and their egos.While putting on a play lampooning the Nazis (whom Benny and the others dislike), the government of Poland (Frank Reicher) says that due to the growing problems with Germany the play can't be produced. So the troop put on Tura's production of HAMLET. Benny as the Prince of Denmark (giving the great soliloquy) goes through the proper steps, although knowing the comedian from Radio one expects him to start it with ""WELL!"". But he finds that a man in uniform (young Robert Stack) leaves his seat in the middle of the third aisles just as he begins, ""To be or not to be...."" He does not know (until later in the film) that Stack had arranged to do this to keep a rendezvous with Lombard in her dressing room. Subsequently he treats her to a plane flight (he is a Polish Air Force pilot). When war comes he and his fellows fight, but the survivors make it to England. The grimmest section of the film is the occupation scenes. Like the comedy in THE GREAT DICTATOR, because we know what actually happened these scenes seem slightly unreal. But in 1941/42 they still get the fears and difficulties of the occupation across. Signs of stores and streets we saw hanging normally earlier are in ruins (including a delicatessen). The theater is boarded up. Had Lubitsch wished to do a tragic film he could easily have done so. But he allows the situation to blossom into a black comedy.Stanley Ridges plays Professor Siletsky, a secret German Agent who has fooled the Allies into going back to Warsaw. He has the names of families of the pilots. Stack is sent back to Warsaw to stop him, and contacts Lombard who helps. Soon the entire theater group gets involved. But will their theatrical egos blow their anti-Nazi plans? That is the running theme of the concluding portion of the film. Also along for the ride is Sig Ruman as Col. Ehrhardt, the Gestapo Chief who relishes the name ""Concentration Camp Ehrhardt"", but who keeps running afoul of Professor Siletsky (it is the Professor, isn't it?), when he makes seemingly harmless comments about Hitler. His reaction is usually to yell for his adjutant, Schultz (Henry Victor), whose whole purpose is apparently to be there to be yelled at.The film was a great success, but the death of Carole Lombard in a plane crash a month after it was shot cast a shadow over it. Yet it was a fitting swan song for that divine comedienne's career.",swan song warsaw,1940 american public was shocked when charlie chaplin released his first all talkie movie great dictator which he lampooned adolf hitler benito mussolini despite new european war we were yet still at peace with both axis states hollywood with rare exceptions blockade confessions nazi spy escape had been gingerly tackling nazis fascists yet public reaction great dictator was odd it had big box office success yet many were appalled because it chose say hitler could be laughed at chaplins response was that if he had been laughed at begin with he would never have become such threat actually other voices were beginning stir hollywood one was great comedy director ernst lubitsch who poked occasional jab at nazis lubitsch had wait until 1941 full assault nazis be or not be film that looked at german invasion poland its occupation warsaw it had interesting cast lead went carole lombard who had many comedy performances under her belt she played maria tura leading lady wife that great actor as he always prefaces his remarks joseph tura joseph is jack benny all leading men her career lombard never played opposite one who was really more star different medium typical co stars lombard were john barrymore fred macmurray cary grant ralph bellamy william powell robert montgomery clark gable fredric march here it was benny who while he had string movie credits was basically radio comedy star later would be television star his best films george washington slept here artists models charlies aunt were not record breakers at box office fact while his performances were good these he did not necessarily shine them laird cregar one simple moment charlies aunt got biggest laugh film nobody realized that his performance as joseph tura would be his best one that within two years hed make his final starring fiasco horn blows at midnight benny lombard proved work well together as egotistical but oddly loving couple theater hams fact actors making up tura company are all good including lionel atwill who briefly is seen playing claudius bennys hamlet felix bressart as greenberg who dreams doing shylock speech merchant venice tom dugan as bronski who hopes play hitler stage charles halton as dubosch stage manager head warsaw underground maude eburne as lombards cynical maid anna screenplay did give plenty time showing difficulties tensions stage company working together handling temperamental stars their egos while putting play lampooning nazis whom benny others dislike government poland frank reicher says that due growing problems with germany play cant be produced so troop put turas production hamlet benny as prince denmark giving great soliloquy goes through proper steps although knowing comedian radio one expects him start it with well but he finds that man uniform young robert stack leaves his seat middle third aisles just as he begins be or not be he does not know until later film that stack had arranged do this keep rendezvous with lombard her dressing room subsequently he treats her plane flight he is polish air force pilot when war comes he his fellows fight but survivors make it england grimmest section film is occupation scenes like comedy great dictator because we know what actually happened these scenes seem slightly unreal but 1941 42 they still get fears difficulties occupation across signs stores streets we saw hanging normally earlier are ruins including delicatessen theater is boarded up had lubitsch wished do tragic film he could easily have done so but he allows situation blossom into black comedy stanley ridges plays professor siletsky secret german agent who has fooled allies into going back warsaw he has names families pilots stack is sent back warsaw stop him contacts lombard who helps soon entire theater group gets involved but will their theatrical egos blow their anti nazi plans that is running theme concluding portion film also along ride is sig ruman as col ehrhardt gestapo chief who relishes name concentration camp ehrhardt but who keeps running afoul professor siletsky it is professor isnt it when he makes seemingly harmless comments about hitler his reaction is usually yell his adjutant schultz henry victor whose whole purpose is apparently be there be yelled at film was great success but death carole lombard plane crash month after it was shot cast shadow over it yet it was fitting swan song that divine comediennes career,0.393500309214595,0.1664718614718615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,Playing Hamlet in Poland,"Having seen most of Ernst Lubitsch American films, we had missed this one because it's not played often these days. ""To Be, or not to Be"" is a wonderful satire that only a director like Lubitsch, with his European background could have pulled. The film is a good comedy that seems to has kept some of its freshness intact.The film works because of the great contribution of Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, who sadly, died before the film had its premiere. They play the Turas, a Polish theatrical couple that foresee the Nazi invasion of their country.In fact, Jack Benny, a man associated as a comedian, first on radio, then on television, was an actor with an uncanny sense of timing. Mr. Benny was a natural for this type of comedy, as he proves in the film. His pairing with Carole Lombard was a stroke of genius. In fact, for being associated to lighter fare, he demonstrates with his take on Joseph Tura, he was an actor of stature.Carole Lombard is seen as Maria Tura, a grand dame of the Polish theater. Ms. Lombard gave a marvelous performance and her contribution to the success of this film is amazing. Robert Stack is seen as the pilot Sobinski. Other faces in the cast include Felix Bressard, Lionel Atwill, Sig Ruman, George Lynn, and others that are perfect under Ernst Lubitsch guidance.This is a film to be treasured because of the work of Jack Benny and the impeccable direction of Ernst Lubitsch.",playing hamlet poland,having seen most ernst lubitsch american films we had missed this one because its not played often these days be or not be is wonderful satire that only director like lubitsch with his european background could have pulled film is good comedy that seems has kept some its freshness intact film works because great contribution jack benny carole lombard who sadly died before film had its premiere they play turas polish theatrical couple that foresee nazi invasion their country fact jack benny man associated as comedian first radio then television was actor with uncanny sense timing mr benny was natural this type comedy as he proves film his pairing with carole lombard was stroke genius fact being associated lighter fare he demonstrates with his take joseph tura he was actor stature carole lombard is seen as maria tura grand dame polish theater ms lombard gave marvelous performance her contribution success this film is amazing robert stack is seen as pilot sobinski other faces cast include felix bressard lionel atwill sig ruman george lynn others that are perfect under ernst lubitsch guidance this is film be treasured because work jack benny impeccable direction ernst lubitsch,0.5583333333333332,0.3776315789473685,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,Classic Satirical Comedy That Gets Even Better As It Goes Along,"Beneath all the one-liners and amusing gags, this classic comedy has an undertone of satire that is quite effective. Jack Benny plays his role with just the right amount of exaggeration for it to work perfectly, and he, Carole Lombard, and the rest of the cast help Ernst Lubitsch to tell a lively yet worthwhile tale. There are a few slow spots early in the movie, but after it hits its stride, everything fits together well.Very few film-makers can make something like this succeed, because they take themselves too seriously. Lubitsch does not, and as a result this film provides a caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal of the Nazis, with a light-hearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them in the occupied countries. The right kind of lighter touch can sometimes be more effective in commenting on important issues than the heavy, emotionally laden harangues that are all too common.While providing good entertainment, this movie also brings out the Nazis' inherent insecurity, pettiness, and short-sightedness, while also demonstrating their growing capacity for destroying the innocent. For example, the wonderful character actor Sig Ruman is greatly entertaining as a Nazi bureaucrat, yet he also cleverly brings out the pathetic side of such persons.Aside from a couple of good gags, it starts off just a little slowly. A lot of time is spent on Robert Stack's character, who is (through no fault of Stack's) not very interesting. Likewise, the subplot involving him and Lombard takes up a lot more time than it was worth. Other than that, though, it moves briskly, with many entertaining scenes while it develops the story. As the pace picks up, the members of Benny's acting troupe get some fine moments of their own, Benny himself has some fine scenes with several other characters, and everything builds up nicely towards a good finale.",classic satirical comedy that gets even better as it goes along,beneath all one liners amusing gags this classic comedy has undertone satire that is quite effective jack benny plays his role with just right amount exaggeration it work perfectly he carole lombard rest cast help ernst lubitsch tell lively yet worthwhile tale there are few slow spots early movie but after it hits its stride everything fits together well very few film makers can make something like this succeed because they take themselves too seriously lubitsch does not as result this film provides caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal nazis with light hearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them occupied countries right kind lighter touch can sometimes be more effective commenting important issues than heavy emotionally laden harangues that are all too common while providing good entertainment this movie also brings out nazis inherent insecurity pettiness short sightedness while also demonstrating their growing capacity destroying innocent example wonderful character actor sig ruman is greatly entertaining as nazi bureaucrat yet he also cleverly brings out pathetic side such persons aside couple good gags it starts off just little slowly lot time is spent robert stacks character who is through no fault stacks not very interesting likewise subplot involving him lombard takes up lot more time than it was worth other than that though it moves briskly with many entertaining scenes while it develops story as pace picks up members bennys acting troupe get some fine moments their own benny himself has some fine scenes with several other characters everything builds up nicely towards good finale,0.5292187940264864,0.22534585606700983,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,A controversial classic that was actually made in 1941,"This movie was made before while the US was still playin' both ends against the middle. Makin' huge profits while staying ""neutral"" The film was not allowed to be released until after, the US entered the war. Easily the best of the screen versions. The cast is tight and the timing is impeccable. You can really tell that the cast believed in the film. Since America had not taken a formal stance at the time this went into production the producers, cast, and crew were really making something revolutionary and controversial. So much so that the making of this movie was not even mentioned on the Jack Benny radio program. Which is a major deal for those familiar with Old Time Radio, Jack's film career provided excellent material for comedy writers on the radio show, but also the radio show was an excellent opportunity to promote a movie. It is doubtful that this was a missed opportunity, what is more likely is that his sponsor or perhaps the network did not want to advocate a position. This movie is wonderful for so many reasons. Not only is it hilarious, there is suspense, intrigue, and history. Another poster, mentions the Nazi's jumping out of the plane at the order of a radio transmission by Hitler. The thing to remember here is that the Nazi army was seen as an unstoppable war machine, so efficient, that soldiers would commit suicide if asked. This was less humor than it was to evoke fear of fascism.Everyone remembers Bob Hope and his travels during WWII, well Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were no slouches either. After all they made this movie. Carole died in a plane crash along with her mother and twenty others returning from a war bond rally before the film was released. Jack went where few if any cameras or radio transmitters could reach. He could be found in the most remote parts of the world entertaining the troops. Not to take anything from Bob, he went there as well, he just had more photo ops.Bottom line watch this movie--twice, maybe more, the dialogue is so quick and witty there is a good chance you might miss it the first time, them again it is worth at least to looks.",controversial classic that was actually made 1941,this movie was made before while us was still playin both ends against middle makin huge profits while staying neutral film was not allowed be released until after us entered war easily best screen versions cast is tight timing is impeccable you can really tell that cast believed film since america had not taken formal stance at time this went into production producers cast crew were really making something revolutionary controversial so much so that making this movie was not even mentioned jack benny radio program which is major deal those familiar with old time radio jacks film career provided excellent material comedy writers radio show but also radio show was excellent opportunity promote movie it is doubtful that this was missed opportunity what is more likely is that his sponsor or perhaps network did not want advocate position this movie is wonderful so many reasons not only is it hilarious there is suspense intrigue history another poster mentions nazis jumping out plane at order radio transmission by hitler thing remember here is that nazi army was seen as unstoppable war machine so efficient that soldiers would commit suicide if asked this was less humor than it was evoke fear fascism everyone remembers bob hope his travels during wwii well jack benny carole lombard were no slouches either after all they made this movie carole died plane crash along with her mother twenty others returning war bond rally before film was released jack went where few if any cameras or radio transmitters could reach he could be found most remote parts world entertaining troops not take anything bob he went there as well he just had more photo ops bottom line watch this movie twice maybe more dialogue is so quick witty there is good chance you might miss it first time them again it is worth at least looks,0.5297940797940798,0.3078989703989704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.45}"
8.0,"Ah, Lubitsch","Only Ernst Lubitsch could have balanced all of the aspects of this film and had it come out right. He satirizes the Nazis without diminishing the evil they represented, delivers a comedy amidst the light drama of a resistance movement, and adds a little element of romance besides. The timing for the film was extraordinary; while it was being shot America had not yet entered the war, and before it was released, Carole Lombard had tragically died at age 33. The film opens a troupe of Polish actors rehearsing a play satirizing the Nazis in August, 1939, a month before the invasion, and it was highly topical at the time.Lombard is simply radiant in her last film, and finds the right restraint and touch between comedy and cooing out double entendres. Jack Benny is funny in the role of her husband, a ham actor whose wife begins talking to an ardent admirer in her dressing room when he begins Hamlet's soliloquy. The other man (Robert Stack) is a Polish airman who soon sweeps them up into an effort to stop a spy within the resistance's ranks.As always Lubitsch treats his viewers with such respect, letting us connect the dots without hitting us over the head with explanations or plodding along linearly. His humor is so clever, and varies between an actor raising an eyebrow which the audience will know the meaning of, and things like the repeated line ""So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?"". He also gets in a lot of jabs at the idiocy of the fascists, the most memorable being when two Nazis are told to jump out of a plan without parachutes and do so with a couple of Heil Hitler's and no questions asked. There are also moments that are quite touching, such as the Jewish member of the company quoting 'The Merchant of Venice' (""If you prick us do we not bleed? If you tickle us do we not laugh? If you poison us do we not die?"").My favorite lines were the sly repartee from Carole Lombard to elude the Production Code: Stanislav: You might not believe it, but I can drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes. Maria: Really? Stanislav: Does that interest you? Maria: It certainly does.Siletsky: Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg? Maria: I prefer a slow encirclement.",ah lubitsch,only ernst lubitsch could have balanced all aspects this film had it come out right he satirizes nazis without diminishing evil they represented delivers comedy amidst light drama resistance movement adds little element romance besides timing film was extraordinary while it was being shot america had not yet entered war before it was released carole lombard had tragically died at age 33 film opens troupe polish actors rehearsing play satirizing nazis august 1939 month before invasion it was highly topical at time lombard is simply radiant her last film finds right restraint touch between comedy cooing out double entendres jack benny is funny role her husband ham actor whose wife begins talking ardent admirer her dressing room when he begins hamlets soliloquy other man robert stack is polish airman who soon sweeps them up into effort stop spy within resistances ranks as always lubitsch treats his viewers with such respect letting us connect dots without hitting us over head with explanations or plodding along linearly his humor is so clever varies between actor raising eyebrow which audience will know meaning things like repeated line so they call me concentration camp ehrhardt he also gets lot jabs at idiocy fascists most memorable being when two nazis are told jump out plan without parachutes do so with couple heil hitlers no questions asked there are also moments that are quite touching such as jewish member company quoting merchant venice if you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die my favorite lines were sly repartee carole lombard elude production code stanislav you might not believe it but i can drop three tons dynamite two minutes maria really stanislav does that interest you maria it certainly does siletsky shall we drink blitzkrieg maria i prefer slow encirclement,0.5268518518518518,0.06567460317460318,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,"That Is The Question, Lubitsch Or Brooks?","One of the very few people who would think to remake an Ernst Lubitsch picture would be Mel Brooks who satirized just about every genre there was in Hollywood. But I doubt that Jack Benny, Carole Lombard and Robert Stack would have lent themselves to the slapstick type film that Brooks turned To Be Or Not To Be into and Mel's version is very funny.When the film opens the biggest problem that Jack Benny has on his mind is who's this secret admirer who keeps sending flowers to his wife Carole Lombard every night while they're on stage. Although it's helped his Hamlet performance, the angst Benny is feeling about Lombard being faithful, pretty soon Benny, Lombard, Polish airman Robert Stack and the whole touring company that Benny heads are all caught up in the Nazi German invasion of Poland which inaugurates World War II.Stack joins the Polish squadron of the RAF and there's a nice little Polish colony as with other occupied nations during World War II. One of them is Stanley Ridges who does propaganda broadcasts for the BBC. And he gets to be good pals with the airmen. But after he leaves for Germany on a 'secret' mission it's discovered in reality he's a German agent and is going back to Germany with a list of exiled Poles so that the Nazis could retaliate against families. Stack goes back to Poland after Ridges.Where he meets up with Lombard and Benny and the rest their troupe and let's just say that their talents as actors are never more needed than in the series of performances they give the occupying Germans.Whether dealing with marital problems or Nazis breathing down their necks Lombard, Benny, and Stack have no shortage of wits about them. Carole and Jack are old hands at comedy, but Bob Stack showed a nice gift for it as well. Of course Ernst Lubitsch's type of comedy is a great deal more sophisticated than Mel Brooks. He also was making his film at a time when the USA wasn't in the war yet and the outcome for Poland and the rest of the world remained in doubt. Not to mention what was left of a liberal spirit in Germany where Lubitsch was an exile from.This was Carole Lombard's farewell performance. Completed in 1941 To Be Or Not To Be was released just in time for Pearl Harbor and it certainly beats a lot of hastily made propaganda films that came out to tap into the national anger. It also got the same kind of knocks The Great Dictator did in satirizing the authoritarianism of the Nazis. But both films have stood the test of time. And it's not as preachy as The Great Dictator, but Lubitsch gets his point across. As for Lombard she went on a war bond tour which ended abruptly in a plane crash outside Las Vegas. FDR from the White House proclaimed she was as much a war casualty as any GI at the front and there were few who would disagree.If your taste runs to an earthier form of comedy Mel Brooks will certainly satisfy you. But for those who value sophistication as embodied in that phrase the Lubitsch touch, this To Be Or Not To Be still pulls in the laughs.",that is question lubitsch or brooks,one very few people who would think remake ernst lubitsch picture would be mel brooks who satirized just about every genre there was hollywood but i doubt that jack benny carole lombard robert stack would have lent themselves slapstick type film that brooks turned be or not be into mels version is very funny when film opens biggest problem that jack benny has his mind is whos this secret admirer who keeps sending flowers his wife carole lombard every night while theyre stage although its helped his hamlet performance angst benny is feeling about lombard being faithful pretty soon benny lombard polish airman robert stack whole touring company that benny heads are all caught up nazi german invasion poland which inaugurates world war ii stack joins polish squadron raf theres nice little polish colony as with other occupied nations during world war ii one them is stanley ridges who does propaganda broadcasts bbc he gets be good pals with airmen but after he leaves germany secret mission its discovered reality hes german agent is going back germany with list exiled poles so that nazis could retaliate against families stack goes back poland after ridges where he meets up with lombard benny rest their troupe lets just say that their talents as actors are never more needed than series performances they give occupying germans whether dealing with marital problems or nazis breathing down their necks lombard benny stack have no shortage wits about them carole jack are old hands at comedy but bob stack showed nice gift it as well course ernst lubitschs type comedy is great deal more sophisticated than mel brooks he also was making his film at time when usa wasnt war yet outcome poland rest world remained doubt not mention what was left liberal spirit germany where lubitsch was exile this was carole lombards farewell performance completed 1941 be or not be was released just time pearl harbor it certainly beats lot hastily made propaganda films that came out tap into national anger it also got same kind knocks great dictator did satirizing authoritarianism nazis but both films have stood test time its not as preachy as great dictator but lubitsch gets his point across as lombard she went war bond tour which ended abruptly plane crash outside las vegas fdr white house proclaimed she was as much war casualty as any gi at front there were few who would disagree if your taste runs earthier form comedy mel brooks will certainly satisfy you but those who value sophistication as embodied that phrase lubitsch touch this be or not be still pulls laughs,0.44220935220935226,0.11352745602745604,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8.0,"Benny good, man!","This is a quite brilliant Ernst Lubitsch film which manages to skilfully combine wartime dramatic pathos with wonderfully barbed humour, without doing so in an overtly propaganda-laden way. Set in Warsaw, just before and then during the initial German occupation which itself triggered World War 2, it starts in a relatively light-hearted manner as we're introduced to an acting troupe headed by husband and wife team Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, he the hammish, self-confident leading man, she the toy-boy-chasing leading lady. When the group's latest production, topically called ""Gestapo"" is closed down for fear of reprisals by the fearful authorities, they and their company join the local resistance. Amongst the rest of the cast are two spear-carrying extras who each dream of bigger parts, one who recites Shylock's ""If you prick me do I not bleed"" speech any chance he can, the other convinced he could pass for Hitler to the general public. When these foibles are adroitly woven into the plot at a climactic stage later in the film you appreciate how well written and crafted the movie is.I've never seen Jack Benny in any other feature and only know him for his deadpan humour on American TV much later than this but he's great here as the cuckolded husband pressed into action by the Polish resistance, struggling to balance his personal life with the National Good. His timing is spot-on and really you have to wonder why movies didn't also become his medium the way they did for say Bob Hope, but if this is his one major film role, then it's certainly a memorable one. Lombard I've sometimes not appreciated in some of her other roles but she's delightful here, coquettish, but clever with it.The film shows the Polish resistance running rings round their German occupiers and also lampoons Hitler in bold fashion which surely wouldn't have been lost on wartime viewers. I loved the interwoven plotting as well as the frequent laugh-out-loud gags - right from the first humorous ""Heil Myself"" to the last ""To Be Or Not To Be"" running gag. There are only a couple of misfiring jokes like when Lombard complicity moans ""Heil Hitler"" when receiving a kiss from the Polish traitor or the too obvious ""Friends, Romans and countrymen"" line from Benny but there are far more hits than misses for sure.For me this film could have worked as a drama without the comedy and as a comedy without the drama.

10.0,"""In the hands of a ham""","It has long been controversial to make a comedy out of war and tragedy, but often it is among the best ways of dealing with a difficult subject. Being able to satirize evil and imagine humour even in the most desperate of plights is a big part of coming to terms with these things. And when done in the right way, it can make some of the most compelling works that cinema has to offer. With To Be or Not to Be, director Ernst Lubitsch, who had spent most of his career making sophisticated and often innuendo-laden comedies with absolutely no political content, surprised everyone by tackling the most urgent of topical issues head-on, yet still maintaining the frivolous comedy style that was his forte.Co-written with Melchior Lengyel (who had provided Lubitsch with his earlier hit Ninotchka) To Be or Not to Be features a brilliant premise – that of actors turning their skills to do underground work. As such it takes a light-hearted yet affectionate view of stage acting (which is where Lubitsch started out). This was a rather timely subject in Hollywood at the time. In the early days of sound, a lot of theatre actors had been called in to do the talkie business, but now the trend was shifting towards subtler, more naturalistic performances, as especially encouraged by directors like William Wyler and George Stevens. And there's nothing wrong with that approach – Wyler and Stevens were making some excellent pictures – but as a result the good old ham actor was becoming a somewhat marginalised figure. To Be or Not to Be makes the theatrical scenery-chewers into the heroes. The debate between the different styles is itself the subject of many of the gags, for example Lionel Atwill continually having to be reminded not to overact. The young Polish airman who woos Lombard is named Stanislaw, perhaps after Stanislavski, the nemesis of ham actors.The casting of To Be or Not to Be is like a celebration of the little hams. You won't find theatrical legends like Charles Laughton or John Barrymore here, but supporting players like Atwill, Felix Bressart and Tom Dugan are exactly the sort of people who were now a dying breed in the Hollywood movie. Here they can be seen at their unashamed best. The two leads on the other hand are not hams at all, but they were among the best comedy actors of the era. Jack Benny was ironically a master at underplaying scenes, often at his funniest when doing very little, such as drawing out the pause before beginning Hamlet's soliloquy. Carole Lombard was a consummate comedienne, often adopting a tone of complete sincerity that made little throwaway lines (like her enraptured ""It certainly does (interest me)"" when Robert Stack is talking about his bomber) sound comically ridiculous. But she could turn that sincerity to dramatic purpose as well, for example her very genuine look of trepidation when she is questioned trying to leave the hotel.And finally let us talk of Lubitsch himself. There isn't much to say about Lubitsch's direction here that I haven't said in one of my many other reviews of his pictures. One thing that is specifically worth mentioning now though is the attention Lubitsch gives to minor performers. Another feature of the more modern directors is that they gave very little screen time to bit players. The aforementioned Wyler would often get supporting players to do their scenes with their backs to the camera so as not to draw attention from the leads. Again this is not intended as a criticism – it is right for Wyler's dramas. But Lubitsch was one director who always found a little bit of camera time for even the most inconsequential of actors. There are obvious examples in To Be or Not to Be with the many members of the acting troupe, but notice how in the scene with the Polish aviators in Britain, he treats several of them to close-ups. These aren't ""face-in-the-crowd"" close-ups that you might see in a montage. Instead it's as if each of these men has become a lead character for a few seconds, even though they will soon disappear from the story. But Lubitsch did not do this indiscriminately. In the scene where Lombard passes on the photograph at the bookstore, there are two Nazis in the background. We don't catch a glimpse of their faces, we just have to know that they exist. It seems that when Lubitsch lingers on a character's face he does so out of affection. And that is really the attitude that permeates To Be or Not to Be – contempt for the villains, affection for the heroes, even through all the wit and satire. It is this ideal that really makes that fusing of the tragic and the comic work.",hands ham,it has long been controversial make comedy out war tragedy but often it is among best ways dealing with difficult subject being able satirize evil imagine humour even most desperate plights is big part coming terms with these things when done right way it can make some most compelling works that cinema has offer with be or not be director ernst lubitsch who had spent most his career making sophisticated often innuendo laden comedies with absolutely no political content surprised everyone by tackling most urgent topical issues head yet still maintaining frivolous comedy style that was his forte co written with melchior lengyel who had provided lubitsch with his earlier hit ninotchka be or not be features brilliant premise that actors turning their skills do underground work as such it takes light hearted yet affectionate view stage acting which is where lubitsch started out this was rather timely subject hollywood at time early days sound lot theatre actors had been called do talkie business but now trend was shifting towards subtler more naturalistic performances as especially encouraged by directors like william wyler george stevens theres nothing wrong with that approach wyler stevens were making some excellent pictures but as result good old ham actor was becoming somewhat marginalised figure be or not be makes theatrical scenery chewers into heroes debate between different styles is itself subject many gags example lionel atwill continually having be reminded not overact young polish airman who woos lombard is named stanislaw perhaps after stanislavski nemesis ham actors casting be or not be is like celebration little hams you wont find theatrical legends like charles laughton or john barrymore here but supporting players like atwill felix bressart tom dugan are exactly sort people who were now dying breed hollywood movie here they can be seen at their unashamed best two leads other hand are not hams at all but they were among best comedy actors era jack benny was ironically master at underplaying scenes often at his funniest when doing very little such as drawing out pause before beginning hamlets soliloquy carole lombard was consummate comedienne often adopting tone complete sincerity that made little throwaway lines like her enraptured it certainly does interest me when robert stack is talking about his bomber sound comically ridiculous but she could turn that sincerity dramatic purpose as well example her very genuine look trepidation when she is questioned trying leave hotel finally let us talk lubitsch himself there isnt much say about lubitschs direction here that i havent said one my many other reviews his pictures one thing that is specifically worth mentioning now though is attention lubitsch gives minor performers another feature more modern directors is that they gave very little screen time bit players aforementioned wyler would often get supporting players do their scenes with their backs camera so as not draw attention leads again this is not intended as criticism it is right wylers dramas but lubitsch was one director who always found little bit camera time even most inconsequential actors there are obvious examples be or not be with many members acting troupe but notice how scene with polish aviators britain he treats several them close ups these arent face crowd close ups that you might see montage instead its as if each these men has become lead character few seconds even though they will soon disappear story but lubitsch did not do this indiscriminately scene where lombard passes photograph at bookstore there are two nazis background we dont catch glimpse their faces we just have know that they exist it seems that when lubitsch lingers characters face he does so out affection that is really attitude that permeates be or not be contempt villains affection heroes even through all wit satire it is this ideal that really makes that fusing tragic comic work,0.49057659208261634,0.16191623637406766,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
6.0,"Starts really great, stays solid","""To Be or Not to Be"" is an American black-and-white film from 1942, so almost 80 years old, that runs for almost 100 minutes and was directed by Ernst Lubitsch. It was nominated for one Oscar for its music and I must admit I did not find the soundtrack too memorable, but then again there is a saying that the best soundtrack is the one that does not distract any attention away from all the other components of a film. This is a definite contender for Lubitsch's most famous film from his days in Hollywood, even if other works by him attracted more Oscar attention. But the number of votes and also the really high rating are fairly telling. So not a bad choice if you want to start getting into Lubitsch's works. The most tragic thing about this film here is probably linked to the lead actress. Carole Lombard died in a plane accident before the film as released and she was only 30. She is perhaps the biggest star from the cast, but I am not an expert on American films from the 30s, just my perception. This is obviously from the days of World War II and while Lubitsch also made films during these dark times that had no connection with this war at all (because they were set earlier), this one here is all about it. There are even many references to Hitler, but also to other aspects inevitably connected to back then, like concentration camps, and it took a special set of skills really to take aspects like these and turn them into genuinely funny moment, like one character's nickname. Like I wrote in the title of my review, I thought this began really funny and if I only talkj about those moments that take place before the invasion, I may have given the film an even higher rating. Downright hilarious there with the repeated joke that one character leaves the audience when the words ""To Be or Not to Be"" (thus the title reference) are spoken and how the actor (the actor's actor) cannot deal with what he considers rejection, even if the actual rejection happens to come from his wife as he then does not know (yet). There are other really funny moments in this part and I want to say that, even if Lombard is good as well, the best performance comes from Jack Benny, not only because all the transformations (he is a true chameleon), but his face expressions were also downright funny every time, especially when he was on stage. And I also liked howw they made fun of him being a rather hammy actor. Which Hammy certainly was not, just his character maybe, that is also how he gets exposed, but I will get to that later. So big thumbs-up for Hammy, who reminded me a bit of a mix between Mark Ruffalo and the young Bruno Ganz here and there physically.Now after the invasion happens, the film gets more serious here and there (okay, cheating on your significant other is serious too, but you know what I mean, maybe nothing happened even, the film as definitely not explicit in that regard, different times I guess). There were even some moments that seemed memorable from a dramatic perspective, such as when the Nazi spy realizes he is dealing with an impostor or when the woman is not allowed to leave the place becaue the guy she met there did not give permission, even if he probably just forgot. Or the moment when the male protagonist sits in a room with the corpse of the guy he was actually pretending to be. But this scene like almost all others also resulted in a lot of comedy, so this film can definitely be called a bit of a satire and it is never really a drama about this priceless list of associates whose lives may be in danger. It could have made for a tough drama too à la Argo, but they took a different route and the one they took, namely the comedic one, was a success. Basically all scene with Ehrhardt were really amazing (not just the concentration camp running gag), such as the mustache moments, but everything else really too. Big thumbs-up for Sig Ruman. Then again, I am not surprised. He worked with Lubitsch for example too in Ninotchka and there he was just as funny. Now back to this film here. I still think it wasn't a great watch, but a pretty decent one. It as all a bit too absurd and over the top for me the longer it went and the more characters the protagonist imitated. It's never really a weak watch, but I wished it could have had some more subtlety. And it was just really unrealistic overall too, so best way to enjoy it is maybe as a guilty pleasure I would say. Overall, there is no hesitation for me though in giving this one a thumbs-up and, like I said earlier, it's a good choice if you plan on taking a dive into Lubitsch's filmography and have not seen anything else before this one. I as lucky enough to watch this on the occasion of a Lubitsch film series in my local theater and this film is definitely among the ones I liked more, but nowhere near being close to my number one favorite. Still go check it out. I was amazed how packed the theater was by the way.

6.0,Lightly entertaining,"German-occupied Warsaw, WW2. A band of actors, headed by husband-and-wife superstars of Polish theatre, set out to prevent a German spy from revealing key members of the Polish underground and families of Polish airmen fighting in Britain.Lightly entertaining. Is a comedy-drama but doesn't entirely succeed in either area. More weighted to comedy, the comedy is largely farce, with the usual sequence of problem arises - much consternation and mad scramble for a solution - gets fixed by something that causes another problem - rinse and repeat. There are some good, even great, comedic moments but they are few and far between as the movie largely trades in cheapish gags.While predominantly a comedy, the movie had potential as a drama. There's the intrigue re the spy, the plight of the Poles in Warsaw, the general examination of war and its consequences. However, with the emphasis on comedy, these sub-plots and themes largely take a back seat. There's also a romantic angle, which just cheapens the drama.Overall, entertaining and not a bad way to spend 100 minutes, but not brilliant.",lightly entertaining,german occupied warsaw ww2 band actors headed by husband wife superstars polish theatre set out prevent german spy revealing key members polish underground families polish airmen fighting britain lightly entertaining is comedy drama but doesnt entirely succeed either area more weighted comedy comedy is largely farce with usual sequence problem arises much consternation mad scramble solution gets fixed by something that causes another problem rinse repeat there are some good even great comedic moments but they are few far between as movie largely trades cheapish gags while predominantly comedy movie had potential as drama theres intrigue re spy plight poles warsaw general examination war its consequences however with emphasis comedy these sub plots themes largely take back seat theres also romantic angle which just cheapens drama overall entertaining not bad way spend 100 minutes but not brilliant,0.5134157509157509,0.10782967032967034,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,Excellent propaganda comedy,"During and just before WWII, there were a lot of propaganda films created by Hollywood to drum up morale in our fight against Fascism. Nearly all of them were deadly serious war films. And, while many of them were great, after a while they all tended to blend together. Because of this, TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a real standout picture. The movie is a comedy and yet is every bit as effective in inspiring the war effort. Now it's not surprising that the film is so well-made as its director is Ernst Lubitsch and he is ably supported by lots of wonderful character actors such as Felix Bressart and Sig Rumand (among others). However, the nice surprise about the movie was the acting of Jack Benny in the starring role (along with the wonderful Carole Lombard). For years, Benny made fun of his acting and the movies he made, but he was great and the film was great. Aside from the rather dopey HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT, in fact, I really like the few films he made.All-in-all, a fine and fun film--chock full of quality.",excellent propaganda comedy,during just before wwii there were lot propaganda films created by hollywood drum up morale our fight against fascism nearly all them were deadly serious war films while many them were great after while they all tended blend together because this be or not be is real standout picture movie is comedy yet is every bit as effective inspiring war effort now its not surprising that film is so well made as its director is ernst lubitsch he is ably supported by lots wonderful character actors such as felix bressart sig rumand among others however nice surprise about movie was acting jack benny starring role along with wonderful carole lombard years benny made fun his acting movies he made but he was great film was great aside rather dopey horn blows at midnight fact i really like few films he made all all fine fun film chock full quality,0.5189102564102563,0.3416666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.1}"
10.0,Jack Benny as Hamlet,"This is one of the great movie farces of all time. I would rank it very close to my all time favorite ""Dr. Strangelove."" There are several tiers of interpretation as is true of any noteworthy satire. It is not only poking fun at the stupidity and vanity of Nazism, but at aggressive war in general. Referring to Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) playing Hamlet on stage, Colonel Ehrhardt (Sig Ruman) states, ""What he did to Shakespeare we are doing to Poland."" Only someone with the comic genius of Ernst Lubitsch could compare the Thespian rape of Shakespeare with the physical rape of a country and make it work.Jack Benny, although one of the most popular entertainers of all time, never got his just deserts for his acting abilities. Though he utilizes many of his physical mannerisms that worked so well for his comedy routines on radio, in the movies, and later on TV, he also does some very fine acting in ""To Be Or Not To Be."" He is teamed with the multi-talented Carole Lombard yet keeps up with her all the way. The two work well together. Had Carole Lombard not been tragically killed in a plane crash while serving her country just before the release of this film, she would possibly have been teamed with Benny again. The rest of the cast, including newcomer Robert Stack, keep up the pace and give all the support needed to make Lubitsch's film a winner, in particular the histrionics of Sig Ruman, the definitive Nazi stooge, later parodied in the popular TV series ""Hogan's Heroes.""The script which Lubitsch himself helped put together blossoms with hilarious one-liners such as ""So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt?"" To read a few of the most famous ones, see IMDb quotes for the film. Better still, rent or buy a copy of this classic and watch it a few times to hear them for yourself. IMDb only lists some, not all, for that would take several pages.The story sounds like one for a typical romantic or screwball type comedy. A troupe of Shakespearean actors in Warsaw, Poland, appear to be on the road to success due to the fame of the leading lady, Maria Tura (Carole Lombard). Her husband, Joseph (Benny), seems to be in her shadow, though he does his best as the Prince of Denmark, Hamlet. Yet each time he does the famous soliloquy that begins, ""To be or not to be,"" the same man gets up and walks out. This leads Joseph to think he is a failure as Hamlet until later in the film he learns that the young man, Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack), is leaving each time for a rendezvous with Joseph's wife, Maria. At this point Hitler invades Poland and the theater is closed as the Nazi's come to town. A Nazi professor, Prof. Alexander Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), flies in with a list of names of traitors (Polish patriots) who are to be taken care of by the local Gestapo headed by Col. Ehrhardt (Ruman). It is up to the Shakespearean troupe to keep these names out of the hands of the Gestapo and then to escape with their lives. So they use their acting talents to impersonate Gestapo officers and even Hitler himself. Joseph becomes Ehrhardt but botches it when the professor brings up the relationship between Maria and Lt. Sobinski who is now in Warsaw also. The rest of the film involves several funny mix-ups and mistaken identities filled with satirical buffoonery. Though this was somewhat controversial when first released because some, including Jack Benny's own father, misunderstood the satire, the film is possibly even more funny and relevant today than during World War II when the Nazi menace was for real. Because Lubitsch made the spoof universal in nature, ""To Be Or Not To Be"" transcends time and space.",jack benny as hamlet,this is one great movie farces all time i would rank it very close my all time favorite dr strangelove there are several tiers interpretation as is true any noteworthy satire it is not only poking fun at stupidity vanity nazism but at aggressive war general referring joseph tura jack benny playing hamlet stage colonel ehrhardt sig ruman states what he did shakespeare we are doing poland only someone with comic genius ernst lubitsch could compare thespian rape shakespeare with physical rape country make it work jack benny although one most popular entertainers all time never got his just deserts his acting abilities though he utilizes many his physical mannerisms that worked so well his comedy routines radio movies later tv he also does some very fine acting be or not be he is teamed with multi talented carole lombard yet keeps up with her all way two work well together had carole lombard not been tragically killed plane crash while serving her country just before release this film she would possibly have been teamed with benny again rest cast including newcomer robert stack keep up pace give all support needed make lubitschs film winner particular histrionics sig ruman definitive nazi stooge later parodied popular tv series hogans heroes script which lubitsch himself helped put together blossoms with hilarious one liners such as so they call me concentration camp ehrhardt read few most famous ones see imdb quotes film better still rent or buy copy this classic watch it few times hear them yourself imdb only lists some not all that would take several pages story sounds like one typical romantic or screwball type comedy troupe shakespearean actors warsaw poland appear be road success due fame leading lady maria tura carole lombard her husband joseph benny seems be her shadow though he does his best as prince denmark hamlet yet each time he does famous soliloquy that begins be or not be same man gets up walks out this leads joseph think he is failure as hamlet until later film he learns that young man lt stanislav sobinski robert stack is leaving each time rendezvous with josephs wife maria at this point hitler invades poland theater is closed as nazis come town nazi professor prof alexander siletsky stanley ridges flies with list names traitors polish patriots who are be taken care by local gestapo headed by col ehrhardt ruman it is up shakespearean troupe keep these names out hands gestapo then escape with their lives so they use their acting talents impersonate gestapo officers even hitler himself joseph becomes ehrhardt but botches it when professor brings up relationship between maria lt sobinski who is now warsaw also rest film involves several funny mix ups mistaken identities filled with satirical buffoonery though this was somewhat controversial when first released because some including jack bennys own father misunderstood satire film is possibly even more funny relevant today than during world war ii when nazi menace was real because lubitsch made spoof universal nature be or not be transcends time space,0.481254724111867,0.17010582010582012,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Skewers the Nazi cause as effectively as Casablanca,"In celebrating the 75th anniversary of the release of Casablanca, it is easy to overlook another anti-Nazi film, Ernst Lubitsch's ""screwball"" comedy To Be or Not To Be, a film that skewered the Nazi cause with equal effectiveness. While not as dramatic or filled with memorable lines and patriotic songs, To Be or Not To Be, like Casablanca, the film features two main Hollywood stars, Carole Lombard and Jack Benny and a love triangle in which romance must be subordinate to a greater cause. Set in Poland just before the German invasion of September 1, 1939, the film opens as a mustachioed man bearing a close resemblance to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler is seen walking alone in the streets of Warsaw.This Hitler, however, turns out to be the actor Bronski (Tom Dugan), a bit-player impersonating the Fuhrer in a play being put on by a Polish theatrical group. Is Hitler ""by any chance interested in Mr. Maslowski's delicatessen?"" teases the narrator in the opening segment. ""That's impossible—he's a vegetarian!"" Responding to all the ""Heil Hitler"" salutes, Bronski asserts ""Heil myself"" as he walks through an open door. Bronski is playing a secondary role to the famous Polish actor Josef Tura, played by Jack Benny, then a radio star whose trademark straight face and deadpan humor marks the film.Tura's wife Maria, also a popular Polish actress, is played by Carole Lombard who was to meet a shocking death in a plane crash in January, 1942 shortly after the film was completed. In the film, Maria is two-timing her actor husband by romancing a young flyer Lt. Sobinski (Robert Stack) who falls ""head over heels"" for the actress. The running gag in the film is that whenever Josef is playing Hamlet and delivers the line, ""to be or not to be,"" it is a signal for Sobinski to get up from his seat in the theater and go backstage to meet Maria in her dressing room. It appears that Tura is more upset about his speech being interrupted than what happens behind the curtain.The sudden Nazi invasion, however, puts all romantic trysts on the back burner and the mood shifts to solemn. The plot now becomes more involved with espionage and patriotism than acting when Sobinski, now a pilot for the Royal Air Force, discovers that respected Polish professor Siletski (Stanley Ridges) is a double-agent working for the Nazis. When the Lieutenant returns to Warsaw to eliminate the traitorous professor, Maria and Josef team up to help by launching an elaborate charade to trick the unsuspecting Nazis. While the film takes its name from the famous line in Hamlet, Shylock's monologue from the Merchant of Venice, spoken in front of Nazi swastikas, is recited by Jewish actor Felix Bressart, ""Have we not eyes? Have we not hands, organs, senses, dimensions, attachments, passions?"" he asks the Nazis, ""If you poison us, do we not die?"" It is a noteworthy plea for tolerance in the days of rabid anti-Semitism even though the line ""Hath not a Jew eyes?"" is not spoken. According to Thomas Doherty writing in Tablet magazine, ""the word ""Jew"" was seldom heard on the Hollywood screen, even in war-minded scenarios where the topic of anti-Semitism was front and center."" He also quotes film historian Lester D. Friedman saying that ""The studio bosses were always—even at this point—afraid of thrusting Jews into the spotlight."" Whatever the reason, To Be or Not to Be is marked with the genius of one man, the great Jewish director Ernst Lubitsch who said, ""What I have satirized in this picture are the Nazis and their ridiculous ideology,"" and that the tone and temper of the film ""cannot leave any doubt in the spectator's mind what my point of view and attitude are toward these acts of horror."" While the film is a broad and biting satire, from the beginning of production in November 1941 to its completion on December 24th, however, events made sure that To Be or Not to Be, as well as Charles Chaplin's The Great Dictator, was no longer a laughing matter.",skewers nazi cause as effectively as casablanca,celebrating 75th anniversary release casablanca it is easy overlook another anti nazi film ernst lubitschs screwball comedy be or not be film that skewered nazi cause with equal effectiveness while not as dramatic or filled with memorable lines patriotic songs be or not be like casablanca film features two main hollywood stars carole lombard jack benny love triangle which romance must be subordinate greater cause set poland just before german invasion september 1 1939 film opens as mustachioed man bearing close resemblance german chancellor adolf hitler is seen walking alone streets warsaw this hitler however turns out be actor bronski tom dugan bit player impersonating fuhrer play being put by polish theatrical group is hitler by any chance interested mr maslowskis delicatessen teases narrator opening segment thats impossible hes vegetarian responding all heil hitler salutes bronski asserts heil myself as he walks through open door bronski is playing secondary role famous polish actor josef tura played by jack benny then radio star whose trademark straight face deadpan humor marks film turas wife maria also popular polish actress is played by carole lombard who was meet shocking death plane crash january 1942 shortly after film was completed film maria is two timing her actor husband by romancing young flyer lt sobinski robert stack who falls head over heels actress running gag film is that whenever josef is playing hamlet delivers line be or not be it is signal sobinski get up his seat theater go backstage meet maria her dressing room it appears that tura is more upset about his speech being interrupted than what happens behind curtain sudden nazi invasion however puts all romantic trysts back burner mood shifts solemn plot now becomes more involved with espionage patriotism than acting when sobinski now pilot royal air force discovers that respected polish professor siletski stanley ridges is double agent working nazis when lieutenant returns warsaw eliminate traitorous professor maria josef team up help by launching elaborate charade trick unsuspecting nazis while film takes its name famous line hamlet shylocks monologue merchant venice spoken front nazi swastikas is recited by jewish actor felix bressart have we not eyes have we not hands organs senses dimensions attachments passions he asks nazis if you poison us do we not die it is noteworthy plea tolerance days rabid anti semitism even though line hath not jew eyes is not spoken according thomas doherty writing tablet magazine word jew was seldom heard hollywood screen even war minded scenarios where topic anti semitism was front center he also quotes film historian lester d friedman saying that studio bosses were always even at this point afraid thrusting jews into spotlight whatever reason be or not be is marked with genius one man great jewish director ernst lubitsch who said what i have satirized this picture are nazis their ridiculous ideology that tone temper film cannot leave any doubt spectators mind what my point view attitude are toward these acts horror while film is broad biting satire beginning production november 1941 its completion december 24th however events made sure that be or not be as well as charles chaplins great dictator was no longer laughing matter,0.534140826873385,0.10765503875968994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,Encore!,"Husband and wife Carole Lombard (Maria) and Jack Benny (Joseph) are the leading lights in a Polish Theatre Company during the outbreak of World War 2. They are currently performing ""Hamlet"" and soldier Robert Stack (Sobinski), who is obsessed with Lombard and attends all her performances, is there in the audience on every occasion. Lombard and Stack arrange meetings with a pre-determined code. When Benny gives his ""To be or Not to Be"" soliloquy, that is Stack's cue to get up and leave and go backstage, much to Benny's outrage at someone getting up and leaving during his finest moment! When traitor Stanley Ridges (Professor Siletsky) passes through Poland on his way to deliver a list of names of Polish Resistance members to Hitler, the actors jump into action to prevent him reaching Germany with the list. Can they get away with their daring charades? This film is funnier than I expected and had me laughing out loud on a few occasions. Jack Benny is excellent in the lead role and the whole cast are on form. There are loads of humorous scenes and the film has a great ending to round things off. It's a shame that they cut Carole Lombard's line about what could possibly happen in a plane from the film. This would have given extra poignancy to the film given that she died in a plane crash after making this film. I think the line should have remained in there.Basically, a gang of actors come good and defeat the Nazis through various deceptions. It's lightweight entertainment that really does entertain.",encore,husband wife carole lombard maria jack benny joseph are leading lights polish theatre company during outbreak world war 2 they are currently performing hamlet soldier robert stack sobinski who is obsessed with lombard attends all her performances is there audience every occasion lombard stack arrange meetings with pre determined code when benny gives his be or not be soliloquy that is stacks cue get up leave go backstage much bennys outrage at someone getting up leaving during his finest moment when traitor stanley ridges professor siletsky passes through poland his way deliver list names polish resistance members hitler actors jump into action prevent him reaching germany with list can they get away with their daring charades this film is funnier than i expected had me laughing out loud few occasions jack benny is excellent lead role whole cast are form there are loads humorous scenes film has great ending round things off its shame that they cut carole lombards line about what could possibly happen plane film this would have given extra poignancy film given that she died plane crash after making this film i think line should have remained there basically gang actors come good defeat nazis through various deceptions its lightweight entertainment that really does entertain,0.526470588235294,0.1647058823529412,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.5}"
,Sublime,"This movie proves that comedy can be sublime. At a time when the gods are crazy, this movie swims with the current, seeking to outdo their craziness. That's why it's also very touching. The outcome of the craziness was unknown at the time. That also makes this film daring. Whether intentionally or not, the film implies that Hitler himself was a Hitler-impersonator, that Hitler is a kind of unattainable ideal, a Platonic idea of pure evil. A similarly sublime and bold and touching film made during another craziness (not twenty years thereafter, as its more applauded cousins!) is ""THE GAY DECEIVERS"" (1969). It too dances with the gods, and breaks your heart as it makes you laugh.",sublime,this movie proves that comedy can be sublime at time when gods are crazy this movie swims with current seeking outdo their craziness thats why its also very touching outcome craziness was unknown at time that also makes this film daring whether intentionally or not film implies that hitler himself was hitler impersonator that hitler is kind unattainable ideal platonic idea pure evil similarly sublime bold touching film made during another craziness not twenty years thereafter as its more applauded cousins is gay deceivers 1969 it too dances with gods breaks your heart as it makes you laugh,0.5800000000000001,0.2009523809523809,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,Splendid wartime comedy and referenced as an over-the-top classic movie,"This black and white classic comedy well produced by Alexander Korda deals with the friendly marriage Joseph and Maria Tura (Jack Benny , Carole Lombard), they along with a troupe of scene actors spontaneously become involved with the Polish resistance. The valiant marriage uses their talents of theatrical interpretation to save Warsaw freedom fighters from the invading Nazis. Meanwhile , during the representation of the famous play 'Hamlet' by playwright William Shakespeare, a spectator, lieutenant Stanislaw (Robert Stack), gets up his seat and goes to dressing room of themain player .....Unforgettable characters , lots of laughs , one of the best films of the film history and the best of the great director Ernest Lubitsch, a real cinema classic. Sensational Jack Benny and sophisticated Carole Lombard who wears lush gowns , this is her last appearance , but shortly after she was deceased in a plane crash . Phenomenal secondary cast such as : Stanley Ridges as professor Siletsky and special mention for Sig Ruman as inefficient concentration camp's Colonel Ehrhardt. However, it was only nominated to musical score for the maestro composer Miklos Rozsa, though the movie deserved several Oscars, unfortunately , did not win Academy Awards . The motion picture was magnificently directed by Ernest Lubitsch incuding his usual 'Lubitsch touch'. At the time of the movie, for the 40s, this one failed and obtained lukewarm reception by public, being a flop at boxoffice, and had lousy reviewers. As Lubitsch was framed to deal slightly with a very serious issue, the 1939 Nazi invasion on Poland. Although in 1966, fortunately , the Congress of United States justly included it in the 'National Film Registry', considering as an American cultural treasure . Of course, in Germany and other countries in German influence was really prohibited, and in Spain retarded thirty years its premiere .The film was remade as an inferior musical version (1983) by Alan Johnson starred by marriage in real life , Mel Brooks (role of Jack Benny) and Anne Bancroft (Carole Lombard's character and Charles Durning (Col.Ehrhardt).",splendid wartime comedy referenced as over top classic movie,this black white classic comedy well produced by alexander korda deals with friendly marriage joseph maria tura jack benny carole lombard they along with troupe scene actors spontaneously become involved with polish resistance valiant marriage uses their talents theatrical interpretation save warsaw freedom fighters invading nazis meanwhile during representation famous play hamlet by playwright william shakespeare spectator lieutenant stanislaw robert stack gets up his seat goes dressing room themain player unforgettable characters lots laughs one best films film history best great director ernest lubitsch real cinema classic sensational jack benny sophisticated carole lombard who wears lush gowns this is her last appearance but shortly after she was deceased plane crash phenomenal secondary cast such as stanley ridges as professor siletsky special mention sig ruman as inefficient concentration camps colonel ehrhardt however it was only nominated musical score maestro composer miklos rozsa though movie deserved several oscars unfortunately did not win academy awards motion picture was magnificently directed by ernest lubitsch incuding his usual lubitsch touch at time movie 40s this one failed obtained lukewarm reception by public being flop at boxoffice had lousy reviewers as lubitsch was framed deal slightly with very serious issue 1939 nazi invasion poland although 1966 fortunately congress united states justly included it national film registry considering as american cultural treasure course germany other countries german influence was really prohibited spain retarded thirty years its premiere film was remade as inferior musical version 1983 by alan johnson starred by marriage real life mel brooks role jack benny anne bancroft carole lombards character charles durning col ehrhardt,0.4285455486542444,0.15196687370600415,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
