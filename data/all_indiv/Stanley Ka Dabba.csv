8.0,"Irrespective of the Box Office result, this should be ideally considered a more important movie than TAARE ZAMEEN PAR, targeting the dark side of our Society.","Instead of going into any comparison of this film with TAARE ZAMEEN PAR, I would like to talk about STANLEY KA DIBBA alone and the cinematic excellence achieved by its director Amol Gupte through his honest and sincere efforts. In few words, SKD is a very simple, sober and free of any gimmick kind of movie made on a sensitive subject related with child education. It is a soulful journey into the small world of the little masters, their truthful friendships, their innocent planning and their lovable concern for each other.It reminds you of those carefree years spent in the early school days, when there was no tension, greed or cunningness in our hearts for each other. When we used to demand very funny things from the GOD with our eyes closed and hands folded. All those cherished moments of our loving school days are as it is there in STANLEY KA DABBA as if they have been shot with a hidden camera without being in the knowledge of all the children. And that's precisely how it was done by Amol Gupte, reportedly with a minimum technical crew barely visible and using the natural lights available to make every child feel comfortable in his own self. Indeed a highly appreciable task achieved by the Cinematographer Amol Gole and his director Amol Gupte which is clearly visible on the screen in its fabulous frames and striking close ups.STANLEY KA DABBA needs to be treated a little more than a normal movie, since it brings forward an important issue of child education in our country. In fact there have been numerous documentaries made on this burning topic but for a complete commercial movie the plot has been used for the first time by an intelligent director, backed by a foreign production house. The film starts off straight from the school premises and also ends right there. So in clear terms it deals more with the School, Classmates and the Teachers and has nothing to do with Parents and Home. Where the first half is very evenly paced taking you into the psyche of a struggling child, the second one goes a little slow but leads to a more solid thought provoking climax, which strikes you real hard.Apart from its remarkable direction the second ace in STANLEY KA DABBA is the performance of all the kids in the movie. Lead by Partho as Stanley, who is also the son of director Amol Gupte, each and every child in the film is simply adorable. May be they are so natural in their act (without anything artificial) because their shooting was done in a very relaxed ambiance and that too only on Saturdays and Sundays in the form of a creative workshop. Partho is purely the soul of the film particularly in its final sequence which forces you to think about what you are doing for the cause personally.Along with the kids, the teachers are equally worth watching lead by the director Amol Gupte himself in the role of Hindi teacher Verma Sir. Amol is just superb as the teacher obsessed with food and so is Divya Dutta as the English Teacher. Especially watch for them together in the scene where Divya makes Amol feel his mistake and repent. The other teachers in the staff played by Divya Jagdale, Raj Zuthsi and Rahul Singh also come up with their genuine efforts. In the soundtrack I really liked the Lyrics and Composition of ""Tere Ander Bhi Kahin"", ""Life Bahot Simple Hai"" and ""Dekho Ik Nanhi Si Jaan Nikal Parhi"". No doubt, a job well done by the Hitesh Sonik with the inspiring words of Amole Gupte himself. (However I really thought it was done by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy as the sound was quite similar to TZP.)The film drags a little after a while because there is no story progression in its initial hours. The director very intelligently uses only suggestive scenes for the Big Competition sequence but still the stage performance could have been more colourful and energetic. Further I couldn't believe that in a Big Private reputed School, both the teachers and the Principal (after so many regular Parent Teacher Meetings) are not aware of the family status of a famous boy of their school and he continues to hide the facts from them for so long. Post interval the film may not be an entertaining fair for everyone particularly the children and you may find them acting a little restless in its final moments.But more importantly, in reality this is not a children movie at all. In fact it's strictly for the grown-ups who actually are responsible for the current position of child education in our country. And in disguise it's also a tight slap for all of us who very well know the truth but still don't like to discuss or do something about the issue at our personal levels.As a concerned person wishing to have a better society around me with more happy, cheerful and educated children in the future, I would like to say that just forget about the weak points mentioned by myself in the above lines. As an unbiased reviewer I had to do that but as an aware movie lover I would like to recommend this movie to every citizen of this country, of any age, caster or region. And would like to humbly request everyone to must watch STANLEY KA DABBA if you seriously want all the children in your family to have a better world to live in after we are all gone.",irrespective box office result this should be ideally considered more important movie than taare zameen par targeting dark side our society,instead going into any comparison this film with taare zameen par i would like talk about stanley ka dibba alone cinematic excellence achieved by its director amol gupte through his honest sincere efforts few words skd is very simple sober free any gimmick kind movie made sensitive subject related with child education it is soulful journey into small world little masters their truthful friendships their innocent planning their lovable concern each other it reminds you those carefree years spent early school days when there was no tension greed or cunningness our hearts each other when we used demand very funny things god with our eyes closed hands folded all those cherished moments our loving school days are as it is there stanley ka dabba as if they have been shot with hidden camera without being knowledge all children thats precisely how it was done by amol gupte reportedly with minimum technical crew barely visible using natural lights available make every child feel comfortable his own self indeed highly appreciable task achieved by cinematographer amol gole his director amol gupte which is clearly visible screen its fabulous frames striking close ups stanley ka dabba needs be treated little more than normal movie since it brings forward important issue child education our country fact there have been numerous documentaries made this burning topic but complete commercial movie plot has been used first time by intelligent director backed by foreign production house film starts off straight school premises also ends right there so clear terms it deals more with school classmates teachers has nothing do with parents home where first half is very evenly paced taking you into psyche struggling child second one goes little slow but leads more solid thought provoking climax which strikes you real hard apart its remarkable direction second ace stanley ka dabba is performance all kids movie lead by partho as stanley who is also son director amol gupte each every child film is simply adorable may be they are so natural their act without anything artificial because their shooting was done very relaxed ambiance that too only saturdays sundays form creative workshop partho is purely soul film particularly its final sequence which forces you think about what you are doing cause personally along with kids teachers are equally worth watching lead by director amol gupte himself role hindi teacher verma sir amol is just superb as teacher obsessed with food so is divya dutta as english teacher especially watch them together scene where divya makes amol feel his mistake repent other teachers staff played by divya jagdale raj zuthsi rahul singh also come up with their genuine efforts soundtrack i really liked lyrics composition tere ander bhi kahin life bahot simple hai dekho ik nanhi si jaan nikal parhi no doubt job well done by hitesh sonik with inspiring words amole gupte himself however i really thought it was done by shankar ehsaan loy as sound was quite similar tzp film drags little after while because there is no story progression its initial hours director very intelligently uses only suggestive scenes big competition sequence but still stage performance could have been more colourful energetic further i couldnt believe that big private reputed school both teachers principal after so many regular parent teacher meetings are not aware family status famous boy their school he continues hide facts them so long post interval film may not be entertaining fair everyone particularly children you may find them acting little restless its final moments but more importantly reality this is not children movie at all fact its strictly grown ups who actually are responsible current position child education our country disguise its also tight slap all us who very well know truth but still dont like discuss or do something about issue at our personal levels as concerned person wishing have better society around me with more happy cheerful educated children future i would like say that just forget about weak points mentioned by myself above lines as unbiased reviewer i had do that but as aware movie lover i would like recommend this movie every citizen this country any age caster or region would like humbly request everyone must watch stanley ka dabba if you seriously want all children your family have better world live after we are all gone,0.5128693767170328,0.17748275162337662,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,A Heart warming marvelous film,"Way back while watching François Truffaut's ""400 blows"" a desire to watch a matured Indian film on a child protagonist cropped in my mind. Thanks to the changing wave of Indian cinema Aamir Khan gave us the brilliant Taare Zameen Par in 2007 which was the creation of Amol Gupte (He was the creative director of the film). In 2011 Amol Gupte came up with heart warming Stanley Ka Dabba which reflected the potential he had showed with the screenplay of TZP. Stanley Ka Dabba starts with a highly zoomed shot of a warm day with a school kid (that's Stanley superbly played by Partho) with bruised face, little shabby yet jubilant walking towards the camera. As he enters the school and changes the calendar followed by a sleepy moment of ecstasy within himself reflects the monotonous schedule of a lonely child who is happy with his own supposed peaceful existence. He is the star kid who is good at everything from books to ball without any air of arrogance. His friends and teachers all love him except Khadoos , an appropriate title given by the 4th standard student to their Hindi teacher Verma Sir (played by Amol Gupte). Verma sir is an unapologetic glutton who pounces on others tiffin (dabba) be it the teachers or students. The cold war between Verma and Stanley starts with later not bringing much awaited Dabba for Verma sir to pounce upon. With a beautiful cat-and-mouse game the student gang of Stanley makes Verma run all around the campus everyday till the group is caught red handed. Without revealing the climax it is the emotional journey without getting too filmy that touches the right chord. With Verma realizing his mistake to the oxymoron brutally sweet climax it keeps the viewer engaged and at the end one leaves the hall pondering on certain aspect of Indian society that needs to be taken care for freedom of more Stanleys in real life.Amol Gupte made a path breaking debut with Stanley Ka Dabba which tells simple uncomplicated story even though it reflects a complicated story about some harsh Indian reality. To tell his story the writer (again Gupte himself) did a commendable job in creating few characters around which the story revolves and took his sweet time in creating each characters. The teachers are sketched out of reality. Rosi Miss (played beautifully by Divya Dutta) is the loving English teacher who is a lady with gentle heart is someone everyone of us again identify. Similarly there is a strict science teacher Mrs Iyer (played by Divya Jagdale) who is not among favorites. Each teacher has been given adequate screen time as needed in the screenplay. Verma Sir (aka Khadoos) is a well edged character and when one expect a filmy flashback on Verma sir's life the writer keeps it subtle making Verma a symbolic extension of Stanley (and different Stanleys in the society). But then to keep Stanley and Verma in the same plane would be blasphemous. While Stanley is symbolizes Friendship and humanity Verma reflects selfishness within.The technical department played a crucial role in defining the mood of the theme with fabulous use of camera(DOP by Amol Gole) that zooms in amateurishly to speak about the restlessness with Stanley's character or in the scene where Verma Sir looks at the dabba. The scene reflects Dabba being an important character in the narrative. Deepa Bhatia does a commendable job in the editing department and same goes to the sound designer who specially during the rehearsal sequences uses right beats of guitar telling us about the joy inside Stanley. The music is effective by Hitesh Sonik who uses the right instruments for respective moods added to it awesome lyrics by Amol Gupte again to add on to the cream. Specially ""apne andar kahin chupa hai ek Stanley"" the lyrics speaks some thousand sentences. And the poems in the film are intelligently human that reminded me of the marvelous poem in another masterpiece film Udaan. (like Udaan I sincerely hope Stanley too wins lots of awards in film festivals and awards)Amol Gupte avoided filmy clichés and forced emotions while writing the story. He didn't go overboard and in his own lethargic space creates a beautiful world of Stanley and provides a cushion of happiness for the audience. But then suddenly in the flight of happiness he punches hard with a thudding twist that breaks the cushion. Yet the end is optimistic and about hope. The movie didn't come with a sledgehammer and all to tell audience about some problem instead it just tells a story about a sweet child n his problem n how he moulded his life to live in an innocent and optimistic way. A heart warming tale of friendship and belonging that makes ""Stanley Ka Dabba"" a must watch.",heart warming marvelous film,way back while watching fran ois truffauts 400 blows desire watch matured indian film child protagonist cropped my mind thanks changing wave indian cinema aamir khan gave us brilliant taare zameen par 2007 which was creation amol gupte he was creative director film 2011 amol gupte came up with heart warming stanley ka dabba which reflected potential he had showed with screenplay tzp stanley ka dabba starts with highly zoomed shot warm day with school kid thats stanley superbly played by partho with bruised face little shabby yet jubilant walking towards camera as he enters school changes calendar followed by sleepy moment ecstasy within himself reflects monotonous schedule lonely child who is happy with his own supposed peaceful existence he is star kid who is good at everything books ball without any air arrogance his friends teachers all love him except khadoos appropriate title given by 4th standard student their hindi teacher verma sir played by amol gupte verma sir is unapologetic glutton who pounces others tiffin dabba be it teachers or students cold war between verma stanley starts with later not bringing much awaited dabba verma sir pounce upon with beautiful cat mouse game student gang stanley makes verma run all around campus everyday till group is caught red handed without revealing climax it is emotional journey without getting too filmy that touches right chord with verma realizing his mistake oxymoron brutally sweet climax it keeps viewer engaged at end one leaves hall pondering certain aspect indian society that needs be taken care freedom more stanleys real life amol gupte made path breaking debut with stanley ka dabba which tells simple uncomplicated story even though it reflects complicated story about some harsh indian reality tell his story writer again gupte himself did commendable job creating few characters around which story revolves took his sweet time creating each characters teachers are sketched out reality rosi miss played beautifully by divya dutta is loving english teacher who is lady with gentle heart is someone everyone us again identify similarly there is strict science teacher mrs iyer played by divya jagdale who is not among favorites each teacher has been given adequate screen time as needed screenplay verma sir aka khadoos is well edged character when one expect filmy flashback verma sirs life writer keeps it subtle making verma symbolic extension stanley different stanleys society but then keep stanley verma same plane would be blasphemous while stanley is symbolizes friendship humanity verma reflects selfishness within technical department played crucial role defining mood theme with fabulous use camera dop by amol gole that zooms amateurishly speak about restlessness with stanleys character or scene where verma sir looks at dabba scene reflects dabba being important character narrative deepa bhatia does commendable job editing department same goes sound designer who specially during rehearsal sequences uses right beats guitar telling us about joy inside stanley music is effective by hitesh sonik who uses right instruments respective moods added it awesome lyrics by amol gupte again add cream specially apne andar kahin chupa hai ek stanley lyrics speaks some thousand sentences poems film are intelligently human that reminded me marvelous poem another masterpiece film udaan like udaan i sincerely hope stanley too wins lots awards film festivals awards amol gupte avoided filmy clich s forced emotions while writing story he didnt go overboard his own lethargic space creates beautiful world stanley provides cushion happiness audience but then suddenly flight happiness he punches hard with thudding twist that breaks cushion yet end is optimistic about hope movie didnt come with sledgehammer all tell audience about some problem instead it just tells story about sweet child n his problem n how he moulded his life live innocent optimistic way heart warming tale friendship belonging that makes stanley ka dabba must watch,0.5579142857142858,0.2560388167388168,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"

9.0,"A gem that will be cherished in my mind for a long time, Thanks Stanley!","The film as its subtitle says is a small film with a big heart.It is the true family entertainer. A kind of film that school kids should see to find themselves on the screen and grown ups should see for nostalgic feeling of school days.The film, according to me is a gem because it doesn't try to be extra - ordinary or path breaking. The film remains simple, realistic and naive. The film is just like a new born baby.No lime lights or publicity stunts were done to promote the film and thats why I love it even more.The director ""Amole Gupte"" (deserves the respect I have for him) has his own good story to tell which is funny (or witty) but really impulses you in the end when a simple message is conveyed in the most beautiful way!Beautiful is the word to describe the performances.The kiddo is already a star.Amole Gupte has proved it once again that he is in the same league of Naseeruddin Shah or Irfan Khan, and he has his own place in the heart of Bollywood.Story is simple yet touchy.Looks as if all the emotions of a school kid are portrayed beautifully on a celluloid.Screenplay is strong and never distracts us from the main track despite of many strong sub plots.Music is very good and suits the movie. Background score thumps the movie and helps in making it a heartthrob movie.The film deserves a 5* but it would be a quite heavy tag to carry for a simple and innocent movie.A gracious 4.5* will be suitable.But above all, this film should not be missed at any condition! I am glad that the movie is not Taare Zameen Par kind of film.Here is no dirty game of snatching credits and above all, no stars try to super- impose over each other ( yes main stream actors like Amole Gupte and Divya Datta are present).The film will be cherished in my mind for a long time, Thanks Stanley!",gem that will be cherished my mind long time thanks stanley,film as its subtitle says is small film with big heart it is true family entertainer kind film that school kids should see find themselves screen grown ups should see nostalgic feeling school days film according me is gem because it doesnt try be extra ordinary or path breaking film remains simple realistic naive film is just like new born baby no lime lights or publicity stunts were done promote film thats why i love it even more director amole gupte deserves respect i have him has his own good story tell which is funny or witty but really impulses you end when simple message is conveyed most beautiful way beautiful is word describe performances kiddo is already star amole gupte has proved it once again that he is same league naseeruddin shah or irfan khan he has his own place heart bollywood story is simple yet touchy looks as if all emotions school kid are portrayed beautifully celluloid screenplay is strong never distracts us main track despite many strong sub plots music is very good suits movie background score thumps movie helps making it heartthrob movie film deserves 5 but it would be quite heavy tag carry simple innocent movie gracious 4 5 will be suitable but above all this film should not be missed at any condition i am glad that movie is not taare zameen par kind film here is no dirty game snatching credits above all no stars try super impose over each other yes main stream actors like amole gupte divya datta are present film will be cherished my mind long time thanks stanley,0.5570704125806166,0.24125231910946196,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.26}"
7.0,Delicious!,"Amole Gupte's directorial debut Stanley Ka Dabba pictures a kid who never brings his dabba (tiffin box) to school, gets attracted to his classmates' tiffins, gets scolded by his ""khadoos"" Hindi teacher and sometimes just manage to satiate his hunger with tap water. The kid is Stanley. From bruises on face to his incapability of bringing tiffin, he finesses with false reasons for all, cutely wrapped in his juvenile voice. Dressed with unwashed clothes, torn pocket and bag, one really expect a reason for it and a story beyond it. Though somewhere on a predictable note, the story telling promises it in a refreshing way. ""Khadoos"", the Hindi teacher, played by Amole Gupte himself, has a lust for food which becomes his weakness that deviates him from teaching Hindi in class to discussing the size of tiffin boxes of children.Stanley's dabba gang has varied characters who marks their presence with genuineness and innocence, from the tiffin rich kid to the true friend. But Stanley is the star in his own way. With his gifted talent, he never fails to cherish his sweet Rosy Miss (Divya Dutta) and also the audience! In such a simple-straight story telling which is yet beautiful, how does it matter much even if the back cast performances are felt amateurish? Not much, really. With Partho - the star kid, Amole Gupte, Divya Dutt making their presence very real, the film flows gracefully. Also, the art-direction right from the kitchen to the classroom makes the movie look more real. Background score sounds well and also the song picturisation adds flavor to it. Jhoola Jhool in the voice of Hamsika Iyer being my personal favorite.With not much packed in it's first half, Stanley Ka Dabba offers you a light hearted, not-at-all spicy, healthy treat in its course of less than 2 hours. It brings smiles, tears and not only serves you a delicious entertainment but also a cause to realize! Watch for it!Stanley Ka Dabba!

9.0,"Good story,Brilliant acting,Great Direction,Brilliant Screenplay-The Perfect Mix!","Stanley Ka Dabba - a plain storyline, with the regular Indian school setup and largely unfamiliar cast - is a well-scripted,well-characterized brilliantly directed movie that leaves you with an immediate freshness that rarely many movies can do.Its the story of Stanley, a 4th standard student in a missionary school. Stanley and many of his friends are the quintessential restless,playful and curious kids. They play,share stories,learn together and yes share their ""Dabbas"" (lunch boxes)-the central plot of the movie,as you can make out from the title. The story is pretty straight-forward here on. You have the different characters in the teachers. A strict and no-nonsense science teacher, A beautiful and encouraging English teacher. However the teacher who takes the cake(quite literally:) ) is the ever-hungry and mean Hindi teacher(Amol Gupte).the movie never loses its flavour, displaying with beauty the innocence and puerile nature of the kids and the rhythmic monotony of everyday school that we've all been part of.Amol Gupte has definitely made one of the best kids-oriented movies in the Indian cinema sphere. Not only is the direction top-notch, he has even acted brilliantly as the insatiably hungry teacher,who shows no shame in eating out of his students' lunch boxes. Special praises to Partho who has done such amazing work as Stanley, and Divya Dutta who just by her sheer screen presence brings in positivity to the frame.When i saw the title and even until the movie started playing in the theater, I thought this was a children's movie.But soon realized it was a wrong notion. This movie is as much for adults as is for the kids.If you want a break from the regular humdrum of Hindi cinema and want to see meaningful cinema without the preachiness (like Taare Zameen Par) then go watch Stanley Ka Dabba, cause u wont be disappointed.

Hats off children. Secondly, great acting by Stanley Amole Gupte and Divya Dutta and other staff too. The best part of the movie is that there is no flaw in it except the duration of the movie. I think they could have added much more to it. But i suppose the director wanted to keep it short and simple.Movies like these makes me proud that yes we( Bollywood) also have something to present, something original.I wont be surprised if it will be given the National Award for best film. The TZP team have did it again. Great work. We need more of such kinds.This movie will fetch your heart in the beginning only and you will crave for more.

10.0,Stanley Ka Dabba - WOW!,"There is a scene in the movie when the teacher gives Stanley a chocolate as a mark of her appreciation towards his beautifully written essay. With a sheepish smile, Stanley takes it amidst generous applause from his friends. He then tries to put that chocolate into his shirt pocket only to find to his dismay that the pocket is torn and is no good to hold his chocolate. This is one amongst the many bits in the movie that fall into place at the end.Stanley ka dabba is a story of a kid who is special in his own ways. On the exterior he comes across like any other kid who narrates stories to his friends, sings songs during class breaks, and doesn't miss a chance to have fun. But, the only shortcoming here is that Stanley doesn't get a lunch box to school. It's a problem only according to his Hindi teacher Khadoos Verma but Stanley's friends like all kids have no qualms about sharing their dabbas with him. But, Verma who himself doesn't get a dabba is always preying on others' dabbas gives Stanley a piece of his mind and asks him to get lost till he doesn't get a dabba of his own to school everyday. This point in story leads to the big climax of the movie which I must confess is one of the most overwhelming and extremely touching ending to have seen in recent past.This movie is all about the magical moments held together by threads of simplicity and honesty. Amole doesn't employ any overtly comical, emotional scene to score brownie points. The movie just floats in a good pace giving enough depth for the characters to evolve and get identified by the audience. He sets up the proceedings so brilliantly that the viewer can't really help but feel like he is in the same class as Stanley's and is actually looking at everything happening right there. And of course, all this culminates into one fantastic climax that'll remain etched in the viewers' memories for long time.Amole Gupte was last seen in 'Phas Gaya Re Obama' and 'Kaminey' donning the actor's hat. Before that, he was credited as writer and creative director for the beautiful 'Taare Zameen Par'. He comes back with this movie, now managing all the major departments and delivering a movie that's just sheer genius of art.Amol Gole, the cinematographer of this movie shot it in a hand-held Canon 7D camera because they didn't want to scare the kids away or make them nervous as the kids didn't know at that point in time that they were shooting for a movie !! Yes, the kids were told that these were regular acting workshops and only in the end were they informed about it. These are the things that make this movie look life like and come across as a simple story with an honest intention.Hitesh Sonik's music and Amole Gupte's lyrics gel so well with the scenes that they seem like dialogues between characters but with a difference.The kids Abhishek Reddy, Saisharan Shetty, Aman Mehra, Walter D'souza and others have all done a brilliant job considering that they are the real supporting cast of the movie. Divya Dutta as the charming English teacher who Stanley admires a lot is brilliantly casted. Divya Jagdale and Raj Zutshi are good as well. Amole Gupte as the khadoos teacher just carries on the great work he has been doing lately. But, if this movie has to be remembered for one person then it has to be Partho Gupte(Amole gupte's son) who plays the central character of Stanley and seems so natural in every dialogue and action of his as the lovable kid.What stands out in the movie is the amazing control that Amole Gupte has on the narration of the story. Never does he let the rhythm drop and displays great control on his direction. For me, the dabba was a metaphor for what Amole wanted to convey through this story. It was a medium for him to give out the message in the end.Its not everyday that I quote Karan Johar but here I go. On the day of the music release, he said, 'There is no mainstream or alternative cinema. There is good cinema and bad cinema, Stanley Ka Dabba is very good cinema'.Yeah, Stanley Ka Dabba is one of those movies that'll try to give out a message without trying to be preachy or dumping that thought heavily on the viewers' minds.As an avid movie-watcher , I get disappointed when I watch tons of mindless and stupid movies churned out by the movie industry but still hope that every now and then on a Friday there is a movie like Stanley releasing!",stanley ka dabba wow,there is scene movie when teacher gives stanley chocolate as mark her appreciation towards his beautifully written essay with sheepish smile stanley takes it amidst generous applause his friends he then tries put that chocolate into his shirt pocket only find his dismay that pocket is torn is no good hold his chocolate this is one amongst many bits movie that fall into place at end stanley ka dabba is story kid who is special his own ways exterior he comes across like any other kid who narrates stories his friends sings songs during class breaks doesnt miss chance have fun but only shortcoming here is that stanley doesnt get lunch box school its problem only according his hindi teacher khadoos verma but stanleys friends like all kids have no qualms about sharing their dabbas with him but verma who himself doesnt get dabba is always preying others dabbas gives stanley piece his mind asks him get lost till he doesnt get dabba his own school everyday this point story leads big climax movie which i must confess is one most overwhelming extremely touching ending have seen recent past this movie is all about magical moments held together by threads simplicity honesty amole doesnt employ any overtly comical emotional scene score brownie points movie just floats good pace giving enough depth characters evolve get identified by audience he sets up proceedings so brilliantly that viewer cant really help but feel like he is same class as stanleys is actually looking at everything happening right there course all this culminates into one fantastic climax thatll remain etched viewers memories long time amole gupte was last seen phas gaya re obama kaminey donning actors hat before that he was credited as writer creative director beautiful taare zameen par he comes back with this movie now managing all major departments delivering movie thats just sheer genius art amol gole cinematographer this movie shot it hand held canon 7d camera because they didnt want scare kids away or make them nervous as kids didnt know at that point time that they were shooting movie yes kids were told that these were regular acting workshops only end were they informed about it these are things that make this movie look life like come across as simple story with honest intention hitesh soniks music amole guptes lyrics gel so well with scenes that they seem like dialogues between characters but with difference kids abhishek reddy saisharan shetty aman mehra walter dsouza others have all done brilliant job considering that they are real supporting cast movie divya dutta as charming english teacher who stanley admires lot is brilliantly casted divya jagdale raj zutshi are good as well amole gupte as khadoos teacher just carries great work he has been doing lately but if this movie has be remembered one person then it has be partho gupte amole guptes son who plays central character stanley seems so natural every dialogue action his as lovable kid what stands out movie is amazing control that amole gupte has narration story never does he let rhythm drop displays great control his direction me dabba was metaphor what amole wanted convey through this story it was medium him give out message end its not everyday that i quote karan johar but here i go day music release he said there is no mainstream or alternative cinema there is good cinema bad cinema stanley ka dabba is very good cinema yeah stanley ka dabba is one those movies thatll try give out message without trying be preachy or dumping that thought heavily viewers minds as avid movie watcher i get disappointed when i watch tons mindless stupid movies churned out by movie industry but still hope that every now then friday there is movie like stanley releasing,0.6019050312432664,0.2178728991596639,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"

,The Lunchbox Children,"Amole Gupte tells a splendid and tasty little heartwarming story that is poignant and entertaining. It reminded me of Nila Madhab Panda equally terrific 'I Am Kalam'. While Panda's film had a more fairy tale feel to it, Gupte's film is more of a slice of life. He has penned down a solid script. He has vastly improved since 'Taare Zameen Par' (which tended to be preachy at times). He shows a very keen understanding of children's psyche. Moreover, Gupte has done a stupendous job as director.Much of the film is set inside a school and it focuses on the teacher's and student's interaction and yet it is done with so much authenticity and sincerity. The innocence and playful nature of the children is beautifully demonstrated and the weariness of everyday school, that we have once experienced, is well captured.The execution is simple and superb. The art direction and cinematography are very good. The songs are soothing, with nice lyrics and music. The performances are brilliant, especially the child actors. Amole Gupte is excellent as the voracious Hindi teacher and Divya Dutta can easily make a strong impression with her presence alone and here she brings positive energy. But the film centers on Partho Gupte who is outstanding with a natural performance which is easily one of the finest of the year.I was initially under the impression that this was a children's film but that's not the case. Both children AND adults ought to watch this because it's an important film that pretty much makes the same point that Panda's 'I Am Kalam' does: All children deserve to live their childhood like a child and they must be educated.",lunchbox children,amole gupte tells splendid tasty little heartwarming story that is poignant entertaining it reminded me nila madhab panda equally terrific i am kalam while pandas film had more fairy tale feel it guptes film is more slice life he has penned down solid script he has vastly improved since taare zameen par which tended be preachy at times he shows very keen understanding childrens psyche moreover gupte has done stupendous job as director much film is set inside school it focuses teachers students interaction yet it is done with so much authenticity sincerity innocence playful nature children is beautifully demonstrated weariness everyday school that we have once experienced is well captured execution is simple superb art direction cinematography are very good songs are soothing with nice lyrics music performances are brilliant especially child actors amole gupte is excellent as voracious hindi teacher divya dutta can easily make strong impression with her presence alone here she brings positive energy but film centers partho gupte who is outstanding with natural performance which is easily one finest year i was initially under impression that this was childrens film but thats not case both children adults ought watch this because its important film that pretty much makes same point that pandas i am kalam does all children deserve live their childhood like child they must be educated,0.6325412858746192,0.3156642817059484,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.36, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"

8.0,Stanley ka Dabba Review,"Stanley ka Dabba is a film written and directed by Amole Gupte. I never felt the need actually to see this film as I didn't feel much attracted to the subject before. But after seeing the film, I can say that I was overjoyed. These films go out to prove that stories with good content still do exist in Bollywood.Plot: The story of a Hindi Teacher who scolds a child for not bringing his own tiffin.Story and direction: The film doesn't start out with that much interesting scene. It paces very slowly to introduce us to the world of Stanley, our protagonist. But as it catches up I remember being hooked to this film. I myself have studied in a Christian school in Mumbai for 8 years of my life. So I could very easily relate to the school environment portrayed in the movie. The Christian schools have mostly English speaking teachers. I laud Amole for bringing that fact in the teachers of this film. Also, each time a tiffin used to open in any scene, my mouth watered. The climactic revelation also shocked me for almost 5 minutes. That was just like someone punched me in the face. But still there are some flaws in this film. The film's camera work wasn't that great. It sometimes looked that a documentary was being shot and there are so many shots where the focus is on someone's face i.e. no wide angle shots. Also, it looked like in some scenes that Amole Gupte was trying to replicate Taare Zameen Par. If he had treated this film different than that film, I would have been more happier.Performances: Partho Gupte stole the whole movie. The innocence that his character portrayed was perfect. No wonder he got a special mention in the National Awards that year. Amole Gupte was also good as the Hindi teacher (He is just named 'Khadoos'). He can safely be called the villain of the film. Divya Dutta was also good as Rosy. Rahul Singh was perfect as the Christian principal of the school. All the kids in supporting cast were also just right.Music: The songs for this film are mostly situation related. 'Dabba' by Sukhwinder Singh was my track of the film. The rest were just OK.Favorite Scene: The scene where Stanley brings up a science project to the teacher and she immediately rejects it stating it's not related to the course and a bit expensive. This scene highlighted to me the problem of our education system right away. We don't want children to think out of the box.Verdict: This film affected me a lot in a whole other dimension. Watch this film for Partho Gupte. He is one hell of a child artist.I am going to go with an 8.5/10",stanley ka dabba review,stanley ka dabba is film written directed by amole gupte i never felt need actually see this film as i didnt feel much attracted subject before but after seeing film i can say that i was overjoyed these films go out prove that stories with good content still do exist bollywood plot story hindi teacher who scolds child not bringing his own tiffin story direction film doesnt start out with that much interesting scene it paces very slowly introduce us world stanley our protagonist but as it catches up i remember being hooked this film i myself have studied christian school mumbai 8 years my life so i could very easily relate school environment portrayed movie christian schools have mostly english speaking teachers i laud amole bringing that fact teachers this film also each time tiffin used open any scene my mouth watered climactic revelation also shocked me almost 5 minutes that was just like someone punched me face but still there are some flaws this film films camera work wasnt that great it sometimes looked that documentary was being shot there are so many shots where focus is someones face i e no wide angle shots also it looked like some scenes that amole gupte was trying replicate taare zameen par if he had treated this film different than that film i would have been more happier performances partho gupte stole whole movie innocence that his character portrayed was perfect no wonder he got special mention national awards that year amole gupte was also good as hindi teacher he is just named khadoos he can safely be called villain film divya dutta was also good as rosy rahul singh was perfect as christian principal school all kids supporting cast were also just right music songs this film are mostly situation related dabba by sukhwinder singh was my track film rest were just ok favorite scene scene where stanley brings up science project teacher she immediately rejects it stating its not related course bit expensive this scene highlighted me problem our education system right away we dont want children think out box verdict this film affected me lot whole other dimension watch this film partho gupte he is one hell child artist i am going go with 8 5 10,0.4887155388471177,0.25026942355889725,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10.0,Eh what did you get?,"I cried a few times. Some times when I remembered feeling like Stanley. Many a times when I remembered knowing somebody like Stanley. In many ways, adults are less wise, more insecure and less resilient than kids - 9 year olds in this case. We seek pity, we are quick to judge and somewhere along the way we came to know reality through our lens of cynicism and apathy. Kids seem to get on with it, take people on face value and see reality as this manifestation of their own imagination.In India, child labour is a reality and quite frankly in many parts of the world, some developed, some developing, to varying degrees, unchildlike acts of bonded labour, abuse and trafficking happen. But what is really worthy of a 10 is not that this film gets you thinking from your mind, but that it gets you feeling from your heart for this uncomplicated, slice-of-life story with child protagonists but I dare say extremely appropriate for adult audiences. Amole Gupte has made a brilliant film, with a fantastic script, amazing photography from Amol Gole, an excellent ensemble cast including all of the kids. He translates his passion for cinema so exactingly on to the screen as a director. For his performance as Khadoos, he should be top contender for Best Villain Award at next year's ""Some atrocious sponsor Flimsy Affair Awards"".

,The Whole World Should Join Hands In The Fight To Abolish Child Labor,"This superb film is a wake-up call to all the governments of the world with stand by and do nothing to stop the exploitation of children.Child labor is a growing trend in developing countries. Shockingly most of the children are forced into it by their relatives. In India over 12 million children are exploited as child laborers and why the Government Of India has allowed it to rise to incredible this figure remains a mystery to me.Children have a right to education and nobody should stand in their way to shop them from acquiring it. Clearly individuals who employ children as laborers should be jailed for 4-5 years. Should they repeat this offense, they should be jailed for 8-10 years. However due to rampant corruption in India, these characterless b*st*rds bribe the Police and get of scot-free.Moving on to the film. Firstly, I personally vote this the best film of 2011 and vote for Partho Gupte as best junior actor and Amol Gupte as best supporting actor.Stanley Ka Dabba is a 2011 Hindi film written, directed and produced by Amole Gupte, starring Divya Dutta, Partho Gupte (son of Amol Gupte), Divya Jagdale, Raj Zutshi, and Amole Gupte. The film was released on May 13 , 2011.Plot: Stanley(Partho Gupte)is a fourth grader who is very popular amongst his friends. He is talented and is liked by his teachers. However, he never brings his lunch box or 'dabba'. 'Khadoos'(Amol Gupte), as he is popularly called, is a Hindi teacher who does not bring his own dabba but likes to eat other's lunch. Stanley's friends share their lunch with him by hiding from Khadoos. Khadoos eventually finds them in the terrace and warns Stanley to bring his own lunch or otherwise avoid coming to school. Stanley misses school for a few days and his absence is felt by his teachers and school mates. But one fine day, Stanley brings his dabba packed with mouth-watering items for Khadoos. Khadoos realises his mistake and quits the school. Meanwhile, Stanley's performance in an inter-school festival is appreciated by everybody. Towards the end, the reasons for Stanley's lack of a dabba is revealed. Amol Gupte is both a brilliant director and an exceptionally gifted actor. His genius reflects in his son. I have all the confidence that when Partho grows up, he will be a great actor. In fact all the supporting actors in the film, Divya Dutta, Raj Zutshi(My Favorite Actor!) and Divya Jagdale give a superb performance. About Amol Gupte: Amole Gupte (Marathi: अमोल गुप्ते)is an Indian screenwriter, actor, and director, particularly known for his work on the 2007 Bollywood film Taare Zameen Par (Like Stars on Earth) as creative director and screenwriter. The film was also initially conceived and developed by Gupte and his wife, Deepa Bhatia (concept, research, and editing).Verdict: my choice for best film of 2011, and a must have on DVD/VCD and one to watch with the entire family, neighbors and friends.P.S: On a closing note, please help in the fight against child labor, if you happen to see children employed as laborers, please report this to the proper authorities both Indian and NGO who are working hard to eradicate it.",whole world should join hands fight abolish child labor,this superb film is wake up call all governments world with stand by do nothing stop exploitation children child labor is growing trend developing countries shockingly most children are forced into it by their relatives india over 12 million children are exploited as child laborers why government india has allowed it rise incredible this figure remains mystery me children have right education nobody should stand their way shop them acquiring it clearly individuals who employ children as laborers should be jailed 4 5 years should they repeat this offense they should be jailed 8 10 years however due rampant corruption india these characterless b st rds bribe police get scot free moving film firstly i personally vote this best film 2011 vote partho gupte as best junior actor amol gupte as best supporting actor stanley ka dabba is 2011 hindi film written directed produced by amole gupte starring divya dutta partho gupte son amol gupte divya jagdale raj zutshi amole gupte film was released may 13 2011 plot stanley partho gupte is fourth grader who is very popular amongst his friends he is talented is liked by his teachers however he never brings his lunch box or dabba khadoos amol gupte as he is popularly called is hindi teacher who does not bring his own dabba but likes eat others lunch stanleys friends share their lunch with him by hiding khadoos khadoos eventually finds them terrace warns stanley bring his own lunch or otherwise avoid coming school stanley misses school few days his absence is felt by his teachers school mates but one fine day stanley brings his dabba packed with mouth watering items khadoos khadoos realises his mistake quits school meanwhile stanleys performance inter school festival is appreciated by everybody towards end reasons stanleys lack dabba is revealed amol gupte is both brilliant director exceptionally gifted actor his genius reflects his son i have all confidence that when partho grows up he will be great actor fact all supporting actors film divya dutta raj zutshi my favorite actor divya jagdale give superb performance about amol gupte amole gupte marathi is indian screenwriter actor director particularly known his work 2007 bollywood film taare zameen par like stars earth as creative director screenwriter film was also initially conceived developed by gupte his wife deepa bhatia concept research editing verdict my choice best film 2011 must have dvd vcd one watch with entire family neighbors friends p s closing note please help fight against child labor if you happen see children employed as laborers please report this proper authorities both indian ngo who are working hard eradicate it,0.5395909645909647,0.4082020757020757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.26}"
1.0,Stanley ka Dabba Movie,"Stanley ka Dabba Movie OK, so enough of praises and subtle style of direction. This isn't a Documentary neither a Main stream cinema . Indeed it's a Debut. Debutant Director Amol Gupte has tried his skills best using a SLR (Canon 7D - impressive). The closeup shots are good, but camera shakes a lot depicting a weak hand held streaks. Although the shots are always cut short. First half is wasted totally showing different tiffin boxes with unusual stuffs. Yes, the Dabbas are loaded with Jalebis, biscuits or chakris. Ironically, there is a rich fat kid who brings a Dabba which can satisfy appetites of many.Altogether the second half looks incomplete and fails flat on the promises or the surprise. The child labor story lacks the punch and the thrill. The whole gag is circumcised around who eats whose dabba. There are several better narration with respect to a child labour. The Protagonist is a lovely child of Gupte -Promising Partho. His eloquence are best in the movie and he delivers with the cute little face of his. His expressions are hard but can come easy with time. The end morals and the statistics cannot save this movie. There was not a single stealer when you talk about emotions. The obnoxious crave for children's Dabba was never explained and so was the Vanishing act of ""Khadoos"" the Hindi teacher played by Gupte. The screenplay was superb in patches and songs were good with the timing. However they could not strike the right chord. Other casts like Divya Dutta, Divya Jagdale, Raj Zutshi and Shiv Subramaniam were not given any screen space.

10.0,A Heartpicking story,"Nice entertainment with high morale......This movie contains...very high morale theme....results attachment with theme from starting frame of the movie....excellent direction with awesome acting from all the characters...Its a story of cruel teacher and student.......FULLY ENJOYABLE......Stanley (played by Partho) is the most popular boy in Class 5. His friends want him around all the time, whether it is to play football after school, to bellow out the Kaminey song, Dhan tan tan at the top of his lungs, or to listen to those wild stories that he spins without a blink of an eye. We learn early on that Stanley does not bring his own tiffin lunch. The director doesn't spoon-feed us with the reason, only giving us a shadow of pathos in the scene where we see the boy secretly quenching hunger pangs by drinking straight out of a tap in the school toilet.Few films have the heartwarming impact of Stanley Ka Dabba, which takesyou right back to the wonder years of your school life.

7.0,"Simple in its plot and storytelling, yet complex with its metaphors of friendship, hunger & the egalitarian powers of the school uniform","There are some films that move you beyond critical appreciation. Stanley Ka Dabba is one of them. It's endearing, poignant and uncluttered. Unlike its predecessor Taare Zameen Par that was a film about kids for parents, Stanley Ka Dabba is for children. And if you're looking right, there is food-for-thought for grown-ups too. One of those films that is simple in its plot and storytelling, yet complex with its metaphors of friendship, hunger, right to education and the egalitarian powers of the school uniform. As an adult, it triggers a flood of memories. In our time, a school wouldn't be a school if you didn't have science teachers like Mrs Iyer. Hardly a caricature, this was a breed that believed in strict countenances and textbook talks. Often stepped in mediocrity themselves, they were usually blind to unconventional flashes of brilliance in their students. And who hasn't heard stories of friends who fell prey to the 'righteousness of right-handedness'. But the strongest connect of the story was obviously with the Dabba. We've all been a part of dabba gangs and had our share of dabba stories in school. I remember that if my mother packed noodles, burgers or pizzas instead of the regular dal- roti-sabzi, I'd definitely be the dabba-star of the day. What we didn't realise then is that the dabba often revealed everything the uniform tried to hide. But then, class differences hardly mattered in class. That's the beauty of innocence, and Amole Gupte captures it well. The main thread of course pits hunger versus gluttony, innocence versus shame and dignity versus disgrace. There are two parallel worlds, one that centres around the very-popular Stanley in Stanley's classroom; and the other in the staffroom where 'Verma sir' unwittingly entertains with his antics. Both their lives are strangely similar. Both long for food – one out of hunger, the other out of gluttony. And both get their share – one out of friendship, the other of pity. But when their worlds' collide, you wonder if quiet dignity has the power to embarrass shame. As a film for kids, the messaging is quite clear without a talk-down or a dumb-down of the issues. I was personally quite entertained by a very talkative little girl who sat behind me in the theatre. She completely identified with Stanley and his world, was very upset with the actions of the 'khadoos sir', implored her father with questions on why Stanley never got his dabba and often tried to pre-empt the story in her way. She behaved exactly like how the director would have wanted her too. And I'm quite sure that she will learn to value her dabba a little more when she gets back to school after the summer holidays. As a documentary film maker, I believe that a documentary with messaging on child labour would never have had the same reach as a Stanley Ka Dabba. I'm glad Amole Gupte decided to push the limits and set his story in the space of actuality, but within the grammar of fiction. The hybrid works really well for me. I'm sure with time, it will charm the cynic too. For now, I'd rate it beyond critical appreciation.",simple its plot storytelling yet complex with its metaphors friendship hunger egalitarian powers school uniform,there are some films that move you beyond critical appreciation stanley ka dabba is one them its endearing poignant uncluttered unlike its predecessor taare zameen par that was film about kids parents stanley ka dabba is children if youre looking right there is food thought grown ups too one those films that is simple its plot storytelling yet complex with its metaphors friendship hunger right education egalitarian powers school uniform as adult it triggers flood memories our time school wouldnt be school if you didnt have science teachers like mrs iyer hardly caricature this was breed that believed strict countenances textbook talks often stepped mediocrity themselves they were usually blind unconventional flashes brilliance their students who hasnt heard stories friends who fell prey righteousness right handedness but strongest connect story was obviously with dabba weve all been part dabba gangs had our share dabba stories school i remember that if my mother packed noodles burgers or pizzas instead regular dal roti sabzi id definitely be dabba star day what we didnt realise then is that dabba often revealed everything uniform tried hide but then class differences hardly mattered class thats beauty innocence amole gupte captures it well main thread course pits hunger versus gluttony innocence versus shame dignity versus disgrace there are two parallel worlds one that centres around very popular stanley stanleys classroom other staffroom where verma sir unwittingly entertains with his antics both their lives are strangely similar both long food one out hunger other out gluttony both get their share one out friendship other pity but when their worlds collide you wonder if quiet dignity has power embarrass shame as film kids messaging is quite clear without talk down or dumb down issues i was personally quite entertained by very talkative little girl who sat behind me theatre she completely identified with stanley his world was very upset with actions khadoos sir implored her father with questions why stanley never got his dabba often tried pre empt story her way she behaved exactly like how director would have wanted her too im quite sure that she will learn value her dabba little more when she gets back school after summer holidays as documentary film maker i believe that documentary with messaging child labour would never have had same reach as stanley ka dabba im glad amole gupte decided push limits set his story space actuality but within grammar fiction hybrid works really well me im sure with time it will charm cynic too now id rate it beyond critical appreciation,0.42307814407814415,0.03168730158730158,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.45}"
,Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind,"""Kitaab"" takes the mantle for a movie with a soul of a child. True to its sensibilities - it is innocent, honest and child-like. Made in 1977 by Gulzar, the movie is an example how a movie should be made for young audience. After three decades one can say ""Stanley Ka Dabba"" qualifies to be in the same league. Amol Gupte deserves a standing ovation for capturing the child in its purest form of human being, not yet moulded by the harsh realities of life. The moments in school are quite identifiable. So are the classmates who vow to remain loyal in thick and thin. The stern teacher and the favourite teacher, we all had them. The last 15-minutes does have a strong message to tell and perhaps scratches the surface of a major underlying issue we all choose to remain silent. In the recent past if you have adored ""Taare Zameen Par"", then ""Stanley Ka Dabba"" is strictly unmissable. Honestly speaking, give it a go!",eternal sunshine spotless mind,kitaab takes mantle movie with soul child true its sensibilities it is innocent honest child like made 1977 by gulzar movie is example how movie should be made young audience after three decades one can say stanley ka dabba qualifies be same league amol gupte deserves standing ovation capturing child its purest form human being not yet moulded by harsh realities life moments school are quite identifiable so are classmates who vow remain loyal thick thin stern teacher favourite teacher we all had them last 15 minutes does have strong message tell perhaps scratches surface major underlying issue we all choose remain silent recent past if you have adored taare zameen par then stanley ka dabba is strictly unmissable honestly speaking give it go,0.5018518518518519,0.10717592592592592,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,"Truly, a little story with a big heart","Truly, a little story with a big heart This is the bottom line of the movie and it sticks to it right from titles.The story is told right in the title animation itself but it's much better than that actually. But how it will unfold is something that has to be seen only. You will find a boy Stanley going into a class and telling stories to justify every act he does. And then the teachers make an entry that is a statement in itself each one's is as natural and as hilarious. It's a science teacher and English teacher and yes the Khadoos Hindi teacher who will be most ruling for major part. Filmed in school for 95% of the time, this movie brings back the school day memories alive.This is story of food and how important it is for anyone, and specifically to children. And in what irony, we are. One gets huge lunch boxes; one never gets anything to eat and fills his stomach by water. This isn't tear- dropping thing but yes a thought provoking one. Then, one man gives away his self dignity and respect to grab food and one denies the same to protect his self respect.The characters are so well written that we can relate to anyone of the children actually and yes it's a complete walk in retrospection to school days that makes this small film a worth watching engaging thing. The production values disappear at few places but that has to be given for the producers who do not have money enough to shoot it better, the editing could have has been better but barring this few unneeded hindrances, it's a story that's universal and prevailing and that has to be taken seriously about.Kudos to the writer- director Amole Gupte who brought such a beautiful story even without the big names like Aamir Khan (who was instrumental in bringing out Taare Zameen Par), the eccentricities like the intro of Aamir, the boy being turned from hopeless to a bright child and all. This is much simple, and much more natural too but the climax is hard to digest and for me the tears rolled down as if they were so very natural.Happy to have watched this, and given a chance please do watch it.
