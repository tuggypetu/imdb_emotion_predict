9.0,"A must watch for its superb performances and for the man, who never lived for himself.","A true story of a selfless protagonist, fighting for the freedom of falsely framed victims of a minority community, this is about SHAHID AZMI, a noted lawyer who was killed in his own Kurla office in February 2010 by some unidentified men. With a mix of more facts and less fiction, director Hansal Mehta makes this best film of his career in a pure realistic style, as an absorbing documentation of the life of Shahid Azmi which is going to be a fascinating yet disturbing cinematic experience for many. Shot at actual locations with an immensely likable touch of romance in this otherwise unkind portrayal, the film reaches its peak with all the gripping courtroom scenes filmed in the most authentic manner rarely seen before in a Hindi film in particular. SHAHID grabs you from the collars within the first 10 minutes itself, especially in the scene wherein even a mother is scared to open the door of their hideouts in the riots, listening to the voice of her son knocking at it constantly. And once you get into the grim, shocking world of Shahid's valuable life, Mehta never lets you move out of it even for a minute, in the next 100 minutes of his film very convincingly. Apart from its scary & unbelievable kind of real life account of a lawyer, what makes SHAHID hit you hard is its sharp editing, flawless casting and superb, realistic performances from the entire talented cast. Perfectly played by Raj Kumar Yadav, the actor goes deep down the skin of his character and surely becomes a strong contender of many worth deserving awards this year. Such is the authenticity in his performance that after watching him, one feels like having met the real SHAHID and for that both the actor and his director truly deserve all the praises showered upon them in the last few months. Other than Raj, there are two names in the film playing the female Muslim characters perfectly and the ease, with which they play their respective difficult characters, clearly proves the true talent of these ladies undoubtedly. The names are Prabhleen Kaur and Baljinder Kaur (Shahid's mother) and they do provide a strong visible support to Raj Kumar's towering performance along with subtle Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub,silently playing his helpful brother. As the public prosecutor, Vipin Sharma once again proves that he is a remarkable actor. Plus Kay Kay Menon & Tigmanshu Dhulia, truly impress in their small cameos, as expected. Also Shalini Vatsa, Prabal Punjabi and Mukesh Chhabra turn out to be a very valuable addition to the supporting cast with their truthful acts. Considering the film from a general public viewpoint, one might find few glitches in it related with Shahid's Pakistani training camp days and his escape from there, shown in just a few scenes. Moreover Kay Kay simply vanishing from the story progression to never return later may also tease many (like myself). But these few points are not solid enough to bring down the excellence achieved by the team in its overall depiction and thus need to be ignored to attain a bigger and much important social objective as desired. Personally, more than the film, it is the message, the purpose and the mission of the man named SHAHID, which forces me to include it in my must see movies list right away, particularly for the Indian viewers, who are facing this religious clash everyday like an inseparable issue of our multi-cultured society. Specifically talking about the unsung hero of many victim families from the minority, SHAHID is an important document bringing to us an iconic name of our social system, not known to majority of people living in the other parts of the country. And the reason for this shameful mass ignorance ironically lays in the way our media works, which actually holds back the positive news for their obvious reasons and always spreads the negative word around in a much stronger and deliberate manner to gain some instant attention. Probably that is the reason why we very well know about the men who made important arrests at those crucial times of crisis but don't really know about the man who got many innocents out of the jail after few years, rightly fighting the court of law with his own sincere efforts.For instance, be it Mumbai, Kashmir, Punjab, Gujarat, Assam or any other region of our country, we always get to hear and read the news of suspected terrorists arrested from anywhere and it's at once all over the media as their main focus. But whenever the same court serves justice making those 'framed people' free after having proved innocent, very seldom we get to hear about them on the channels or respectfully mentioned in the headlines on the first page. The poor coverage of such cases, don't let us know about many courageous and human right activists like SHAHID AZMI and therefore the film presented on his life is indeed a very vital and major contribution made by Hansal Mehta and his team to Indian Cinema as well to Indian social system, embracing diverse religious beliefs since centuries. Practicing as the lawyer for such special framed cases, Shahid had an astonishing record of getting 17 acquittals from the court in his short career span of only seven years. And even thinking about those 17 families greeting their wrongly framed members back in home is enough to make you realize the relevance & importance of this historical achievement made by the makers of SHAHID. So if you are willing to see a rare kind of alarming as well as enlightening biographical film made on a true fighter who always fought for others in his forcibly shortened life of only 32 years, then do watch SHAHID as a must and celebrate this new triumph of Indian cinema made for a cause.",must watch its superb performances man who never lived himself,true story selfless protagonist fighting

9.0,A strong evidential piece of cinema that enlightens!,"I feel ashamed of myself for not knowing Shahid Azmi- a slain lawyer and an altruistic humane activist before Hansal Mehta came up with a strong evidential piece of cinema that does not merely solve the purpose to entertain but also dares to enlighten our unresponsive- unsympathetic minds confined into its own safe but scared place to stay put. We probably have become either numb to whatever happens in our neighborhoods or blatantly reactive about just anything that comes in way without assessing what is right and what is not.'SHAHID' is the need of the hour. It demands and shows the guts to start a never-ending movement, if not on the roads, definitely in our heads, to bring change in the system by joining it and not wiping it out or denying its very existence. Shahid, played by 'Kai Po Che!' fame Raj Kumar could be anyone of thousands who gets trapped into the torturous custody of Indian Police known for its tactical power-driven machinery and is thrown into Jail for beholding a name that comes from a certain section of people in minoritybut where the most would disappear in the galore to turn radical against country & its governing bodies, Shahid decides to stand out. While his tenure in longing to get set free, Shahid keeps his conscience alive and opts to be a helping hand for those who have nothing but an assurance of not being guilty.SHAHID is an extraordinary effort in terms of writing and direction. Based on the real-life criminal lawyer-cum-human rights activist Shahid Azmi, film amalgamates facts and fiction beautifully. It is a biopic that is handled with sheer honesty, clarity in thoughts, rightly positioned screenplay, brilliance in execution and a very very significant memorandum to all human beings. Hansal Mehta never and never loses his grip on the subject. He keeps it as real as it is happening in a gully adjacent to my living place. Special mention to the replication of Indian courts' undramatic-nontheatrical-dreary modus operandi where there is no usual Bollywood 'order-order' but an actual exchange of verbal spats. Camera work by Anuj Dhawan captures the environs and the emotions equally good. Dialogues are crisp, colloquial and taut. But what make it an exceptional biopic are the performances. Shahid's fearless-in your face-uncomplicated character could never come so strong if Raj Kumar has not given it his flesh & blood. This man can make you laugh with his charmingly simplistic behavior, watch it when he is trying to be comfortable with his lady-love still unaware of his feelings, and also can make your heart bleed with his heartrending silence when attacked for his forgettable past. Extended applause for his bravura performance! Prabhleen Sandhu as his wife too is a gifted actor. She brings with herself an unpolished charm that hits every chord she aims to. Md. Zeeshan Ayyub here has not much like in RAANJHANAA to overwhelm you but still he keeps your expectations fulfilled. Kay Kay Menon and Tigmanshu Dhulia play their parts efficiently with a sparkling presence on screen.After PAAN SINGH TOMAR, here comes an earnest biographical drama that I hope could change the way Indian Cinema thinks about our real life heroes. This is also a film that raises many a questions about humanity and its survival in today's times. It also shows our judiciary system in true lights. As said in the film by the character Kay Kay Menon plays, ""It takes time but it works."" Painfully correct!On the whole, very few people dare to rise and take a stand to tell a story that might have been vanished from lives & in files if not attempted. Hansal Mehta joins the same league.

8.0,Amazing,"Rarely in Bollywood biopics look so real, Normally we are accustomed to seeing bollywood biopics with song and dance and all, Shahid however tries very much to be real. Hansal Mehta after several rubbish films comes back with a striker. The film tries to depict the life of Shahid Azmi who was killed in 2010. The film starts off well to the point, but the entire Kashmir episode could be dealt with more importance as it looks too abrupt, but the rest of the film, the way he becomes a lawyer and till the end are really superb. However the romantic track does distract though it is necessary yet thankfully it isn't too filmy.The climax does seem a bit abrupt but otherwise the film does full justice to the subject.Hansal Mehta surprises everyone with a brilliant concept and superb handlingRajkumar Yadav who started off doing small roles in Shaitan, Talaash and a lead in Ragini MMS and of course Kai Po Che finally proves that he is indeed here to stay if anyone has doubts, he is simply amazing, his unconventional looks and dialect suit the role perfectly, his expressions are really outstanding. Prabhleen Sandhu is perfect as Mariam though her role is not too demanding yet she gives a superb performance. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Arif Azmi is really superb yet again after Jannat 2 and Ranjhanaa, he is here to stay. The film has cameos by KK Menon and Tigmanshu Dhulia and both are perfect, Prabal Panjabi known for his comic roles in Mujhse Fraandship Karoge and Mere Dad Ki Maruti stuns everyone with an understated performance The others mostly unknown faces give natural performances too.",amazing,rarely bollywood biopics look so real normally we are accustomed seeing bollywood biopics with song dance all shahid however tries very much be real hansal mehta after several rubbish films comes back with striker film tries depict life shahid azmi who was killed 2010 film starts off well point but entire kashmir episode could be dealt with more importance as it looks too abrupt but rest film way he becomes lawyer till end are really superb however romantic track does distract though it is necessary yet thankfully it isnt too filmy climax does seem bit abrupt but otherwise film does full justice subject hansal mehta surprises everyone with brilliant concept superb handlingrajkumar yadav who started off doing small roles shaitan talaash lead ragini mms course kai po che finally proves that he is indeed here stay if anyone has doubts he is simply amazing his unconventional looks dialect suit role perfectly his expressions are really outstanding prabhleen sandhu is perfect as mariam though her role is not too demanding yet she gives superb performance mohammed zeeshan ayyub as arif azmi is really superb yet again after jannat 2 ranjhanaa he is here stay film has cameos by kk menon tigmanshu dhulia both are perfect prabal panjabi known his comic roles mujhse fraandship karoge mere dad ki maruti stuns everyone with understated performance others mostly unknown faces give natural performances too,0.6532828282828284,0.30782828282828284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,"style of Sinclair Lewis, or on a really good day, John Grisham","Hansal Mehta's SHAHID, in Hindi, begins with the murder of a lawyer in his office. His first name, Shahid, which also means 'martyr' indicates that he was Muslim. We flashback to the riots in the early 1990s in which he is caught up, causing him to train with Muslim militants in Kashmir. This is not the Kashmir of so many Hindi film songs and dances, but of narrow roads cut into enormous cliffs, the rocks overhanging them. Shahid runs away from the training camp when he is forced to witness the beheading of a turncoat, is arrested in Delhi, and in Tihar Jail must choose between siding with terrorists again or continuing his former law studies. He chooses the latter, but on release finds that the law is a double- sided game. So he starts his own practice and takes on only the cases he wants. One is of a woman whose mother-in-law wants her house; we learn later that she is divorced, has a child, and that Shahid wants to marry her. He does, and his family reluctantly agrees. But the majority of his cases favor Muslims who have been falsely accused of terrorism, as we move through more terrorist attacks over time, including the 26/11 attack on the Taj Hotel. In every case shown, including the one involving the house, he receives phone threats, until ...

8.0,"Shahid, Law aur Gangster.","'Shahid' is about the life of the controversial lawyer Shahid Azmi who was assassinated in 2010. Directed by Hansal Mehta, produced by AKFPL, Bohra Bros, and distributed by UTV Motion pictures . The film is set to release on the 18th of October after its world premier at the 2012 TIFF. The movie stars Raj Kumar Yadav in the title character and the story revolves mainly around him. Hope the producers and the director join again to make a biopic on the life of Narendra Dabholkar(Another Marathi icon who was recently assassinated). The story opens with Shahid being shot point blank at his office and it continues linearly otherwise. The opening immediately reminded me of 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' and 'Jobs'. Is it a necessity that biopics should begin very dramatically or with a possible ending of the life of the person depicted? Is it because there are many milestones in the life of icons that its difficult to create an apt ending to these sort of movies? The movie showcases more of a rather sweet life of Shahid in the first half and gains momentum in the second half where the major drama occurs. Pre-interval drama is more of Shahid's own upcoming and the people he meets while post-interval is full of courtroom drama. The interval was placed exactly at the mid point of the parabolic life story of Shahid Azmi. I wonder how Raj Kumar was chosen to play the role of Shahid when he looks nowhere close to the man he's portraying. Apart from the looks the guy was very comfortable in his role. Actors should take up biopics seriously as it has more scope for them(Take Ashton Kutcher as an Inspiration). Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Arif, he's one actor to look out for his subtle reactions. He made us realize that if not for Arif, Shahid wouldn't have accomplished so much. Prabhleen Sandhu(Mariyam), K K Menon(War Saab), Tigmanshu Dhulia(Maqbool Menon) in their respective small roles made the story complete. Very few people knew about Shahid Azmi and I think that this man should be made known to everyone. I've not lived when there was a Gandhi but was alive when Shahid was fighting for the lives of the innocent in a polite way. There's a point in the movie where Shahid is being provoked by a prosecutor about his dark past and this is what he says to her ""I can sue you but I won't"". Such a remarkable character he should have been. His record of 17 acquittals in a short span of time is indeed a great achievement so people please watch this for sure, Shahid will not disappoint you. I hope more such biopics should be made and the patronage for such genre will increase. In a country where iconic people are made gods, a film made about them will be a blessing.

Fortunately, I was lucky to watch SHAHID and it blew away my mind with incomparable direction and stupendous performances.Based on the life of lawyer and social activist Shahid Azmi, SHAHID gives real-time events which changed the life of an innocent boy to a social activist who was only committed to fight for justice.It takes courage and guts to make a movie like SHAHID. The movie opens with a bang with torture scene giving you goose-bumps. As the movie progress, you will be sucked into the film. The court-drama, romantic track and even the climax sequences are definitely the highlight of the film. Full credit should be given to Hansal Mehta for finally coming out with sensible film after year of delivering flops. Screenplay is tight. Art direction and cinematography is simple yet powerful. Raj Kumar Yadav gives his career-best performance. He fits into the character of Shahid Azmi as if it is tailor-made for him.

10.0,The best film I've watched recently!!!,"Saw this film today and couldn't resist coming to IMDb and look at this movie's page.I was shocked to see the 6.7 rating and read the 3 reviews which give 7 stars(hopefully that will change).Now,it could be just that not everyone likes this movie as much as I do.But,when I think about it there is not a single thing about this movie that you can criticize.This movie is as underrated as you can find.Acting by every actor in the film is top-notch.But,the acting of protagonist's mother and Kay Kay Menon are something exceptional.Cinematography is also good compared to other Indian movies.If this movie had a more famous actor like Aamir Khan or Akshay Kumar,I am sure I wouldn't have write this review.Story is both cruel and sweet. If you have not seen it till now and you are reading this then STOP AND WATCH IT NOW.You will not regret this.I know you have read previous two lines in reviews of almost every random movie but I really mean it.Even though I have viewed it only once,I can tell you that this movie will be among my favorite films.

10.0,Shahid ! Nice movie after a long time,"Watched this movie recently and i was simply too much impressed with its script, acting, and direction all were just too natural, real and perfect, hardly i realized in 150 minutes that i am watching a movie.The story was very sensitive as it was based on real life of Late lawyer Shahid Azmi who known for his high acquittal rate specially of terror accused who are falsely implicated in terror cased being poor and helpless, he was gunned down by unknown men in his office on Feb 2010 as he was defending the accused of 26/11 Fahim khan.The story is portrayed in such a gripping, yet responsible manner that it makes you hold your attention right from the beginning where we first meet Shahid as a young boy scarred by the barbaric violence during the communal riots of Mumbai in 1993. The devastating impact of those events prompts him to join a terrorist training camp in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. But in a terrific scene that illustrates the actor's ability to convey volumes without the crutch of words, he changes his mind and heads back home.Shahid spent 6 years in Tihar jail along with the other terror accused, and kept hope and continued his studies being in Jail and latter was acquitted by the court after 6 years as there was no evidence found against him.A scene that stings with honesty, Shahid asks a packed courtroom if an accused by the name of Matthew, Donald, Suresh, or More, would be singled out and subjected to the same injustice as his client Zaheer, who has remained in jail for a year-and-a-half although no evidence could be gathered against him.This film has remarkable cast and their perfect performances. Particularly worthy of mention: Prabhleen Sandhu as Shahid's wife Mariam, who brings depth and real feeling. Also, Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub (last seen playing Dhanush's friend in Raanjhanaa), wonderful as Shahid's trusted sibling Khalid. Expectedly it's Rajkumar Yadav who provides the soul of this fearless film. Relying on minimalist instinctive acting over loud theatrics, he delivers his second winning performance this year after Kai Po Che.Shahid according to me is GEM of a movie produced in recent years. Its hard to find such movies these days , where a good movie is only defined by how much money it has made.My rating 10/10",shahid nice movie after long time,watched this movie recently i was simply too much impressed with its script acting direction all were just too natural real perfect hardly i realized 150 minutes that i am watching movie story was very sensitive as it was based real life late lawyer shahid azmi who known his high acquittal rate specially terror accused who are falsely implicated terror cased being poor helpless he was gunned down by unknown men his office feb 2010 as he was defending accused 26 11 fahim khan story is portrayed such gripping yet responsible manner that it makes you hold your attention right beginning where we first meet shahid as young boy scarred by barbaric violence during communal riots mumbai 1993 devastating impact those events prompts him join terrorist training camp pakistan occupied kashmir but terrific scene that illustrates actors ability convey volumes without crutch words he changes his mind heads back home shahid spent 6 years tihar jail along with other terror accused kept hope continued his studies being jail latter was acquitted by court after 6 years as there was no evidence found against him scene that stings with honesty shahid asks packed courtroom if accused by name matthew donald suresh or more would be singled out subjected same injustice as his client zaheer who has remained jail year half although no evidence could be gathered against him this film has remarkable cast their perfect performances particularly worthy mention prabhleen sandhu as shahids wife mariam who brings depth real feeling also mohammad zeeshan ayyub last seen playing dhanushs friend raanjhanaa wonderful as shahids trusted sibling khalid expectedly its rajkumar yadav who provides soul this fearless film relying minimalist instinctive acting over loud theatrics he delivers his second winning performance this year after kai po che shahid according me is gem movie produced recent years its hard find such movies these days where good movie is only defined by how much money it has made my rating 10 10,0.4847768793051812,0.1204836777478287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.45}"

8.0,Stabs Directly Into Our Heart.,"That is what Hansal Mehta succeeds in achieving by adopting the life of Shahid Azmi into silver screen. With powerful performances and an engaging story-line, Shahid is one of 2013's best films.Rajkummar Rao has evolved into a more mature actor with this role, if we compare his previous stints. His commitment to the film can be clearly seen by the portrayal. I was mesmerized with how he handled the emotions & the advocacy. Brilliant! Special mention for Mohammed Zeeshan & Prabhleen Sandhu for their marvelous support. Although, few other actors were average, they didn't affect the film intrinsically.Next, the story is written in pure thrilling style not dwelling on points that would induce boredom. It constantly kicks us in the stomach as we get uncomfortable with the scenes on-screen. The reality shown is excellent. A good screenplay & fine score couples the whole film together. Mehta's direction is appreciable.It throws light into how practicing law cannot always be gleeful i.e. if you are fighting for a cause.

9.0,A must watch thought-provoking-emotional-thriller.,"Ever wondered a movie which is so-simple in it's presentation as well as hard-hitting at the same time? A movie which tries to grasp you emotionally but then hits you hard in the face?Well, earlier Raj Kumar Gupta's Aamir was one of those now Shahid joins that list. Shahid first teaches you, ""Jurm Karne Waale Aur Jurm Sehne Waale Dono Ka Koi Mazhab Nahi Hota"" and then right from the start you keep on asking yourself Why on earth do these things happen? Why? Why?Shahid is a biopic of Shahid Azmi, a man who first became the victim of being accused by the police of knowing a terrorist and how he gets a motive in his life for doing higher studies while he is serving jail time. You must have guessed it by now that after his acquittal he goes on to study LAW and then helps the hopeless people who falsely become the victim like him of unsubstantial accusations made by the police.Shahid played by Raj Kumar Yadav is nothing less than a class act. There is a certain innocence in his portrayal of Shahid Azmi which makes you feel about the character. You just cannot take your eyes off him when he is performing. When he cries you feel sad when he smiles you smile and when he gets scared you care for him.This is no mean feat for an actor who is so young and with this amount of talent he certainly is the future of BOLLYWOOD, thanks to his presence in GOW2, LSD, Kai Po Che!, and a small yet noticeable role in Talaash. The supporting cast is commendable being led by Kay Kay Menon who is as usual a treat to watch, Tigmanshu Dhulia who still has that look in his famous dialogue of GOW- ""Beta, tumse na ho payega"" in Why do we make money?. Believe me it's worth it looking at him many a times more with that look. And lastly its Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub(remember Murari of Raanjhnaa) as a so-sensible and more-responsible elder brother.Hansal Mehta, the director and writer Apurva Asrani and Sameer Singh has kept the movie emotional as well as thought provoking which is an achievement as it's really hard to maintain a line between these two. Whatever it is but Shahid is engaging and thrilling as those acts of terrorism keep on coming after certain interval of time and then you are also emotionally attached with the central character. The one thing which also does favor to the movie is that it's not predictable. The background score is engaging and the one and only song Beparwah sung by Arijit Singh is really lovable and infectious. Supported by great visuals in parts and dark where it's needed from Anuj Dhawan the cinematography is worth appreciating.I recommend you do watch this biopic of a real life hero which works in every department. I wouldn't hesitate to say this is one of the best movies of this year and cannot be missed.

9.0,Brave and Beautiful!,"This film is a winner all the way, being one of the brilliant contemporary Indian films till date. Based on the life accounts of one of the most controversial figures of our times, the slain lawyer Shahid Azmi who got 17 cases successful in 7 years of his career, the film also highlights the Indian judiciary system and the venom of terrorism in broader light by director Hansal Mehta (also directed ""Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar!""/2000) whose narration is gritty, no nonsense and moreover without any melodrama which will make you sympathize and criticize few moments in the film. The film scores with it's screenplay (Sameer Gautam Singh, Apurva Asrani and Hansal Mehta) whose development and portrayal has shades of films like ""Lawrence Of Arabia"", ""Bombay"", ""Mammo"", ""Black Friday"" and ""Aamir"". and even in the dialogue part, few of the lines here are much better than that of what we hear the punchlines in the so called Masala entertainers. The film has a great cinematography by Anuj Dhawan which captures the depth of the life and surroundings of the protagonist brilliantly and the editing by Apurva Asrani which is a reminiscent of his brilliance in the 1998 cult ""Satya"" where he has done an award winning job in making the film slick, sharp and smooth. In performances, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Kay Kay Menon, Vipi Sharma, Akash Sinha, Prabhleen Sandhu and Baljinder Kaur are true to their roles and hatsoff to the casting genius Mukesh Chhabra for picking up such a great starcast which make the frame go alive with their brilliance. Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub is great in the film as he returns with his ""Raanjhanaa"" charms and last but not the least is Raj Kumar: Take A Bow as he walks away with all the applauds with such a brilliant portrayal of the slain lawyer with sheer excellence.

,It's fiction!,"A fake biography exaggerated to prove the subject was a saint. He could be good or bad, I am not saying he was not a good guy. But this story is fictitious. And using fiction to paint somebody's image calling it biography is wrong. Most people come out of the theater thinking it was completely true as it is tried to portray. And absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, what he did to win his cases only he knows. But if his image was to be portrayed it shouldn't have been mixed with fiction. Or it should have been claimed to be completely fictional story. Director even mixes his life's story to make the story more dramatic. I would have rated it 10/10 if it was not connected to a real person (with controversial life). He acquitted 17 people in a short period can also mean he was just a brilliant lawyer and nothing to do with innocence of people he defended. Even Dr Naik would make a brilliant lawyer but only faithful to people of his faith. Also there is no mention of how many cases he lost because he couldn't win while defending a real terrorist. So yes there can be shortcoming in Indian law enforcement but that doesn't warrant painting a lawyer (with unknown/unproved intent) as saint using fiction.",its fiction,fake biography exaggerated prove subject was saint he could be good or bad i am not saying he was not good guy but this story is fictitious using fiction paint somebodys image calling it biography is wrong most people come out theater thinking it was completely true as it is tried portray absence evidence is not evidence absence what he did win his cases only he knows but if his image was be portrayed it shouldnt have been mixed with fiction or it should have been claimed be completely fictional story director even mixes his lifes story make story more dramatic i would have rated it 10 10 if it was not connected real person with controversial life he acquitted 17 people short period can also mean he was just brilliant lawyer nothing do with innocence people he defended even dr naik would make brilliant lawyer but only faithful people his faith also there is no mention how many cases he lost because he couldnt win while defending real terrorist so yes there can be shortcoming indian law enforcement but that doesnt warrant painting lawyer with unknown unproved intent as saint using fiction,0.5816964285714288,0.11830357142857144,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,Fictitious yet not hard to believe.,"Shahid is one of those low budget movies which comes in every year and gets pummeled by all the star studded, extravagant, over the top commercial films. Premiering in Sept 2012 in the Toronto Film Festival and Oct 2013 in India, it has been successful throughout, but has not gained the popularity/recognition it deserves. Shahid deals with two very delicate subjects – Terrorism and Hindu-Muslim conflicts. We have seen these themes explored in a lot of movies before; however, this movie stands apart because it is a Biography (Almost). Even though a message at the start of the movie clearly mentions that it's a work of fiction 'inspired' from a real life incident, nowhere in the movie does it seem like the director or the writers have exaggerated. Shahid is the story of Shahid Azmi, a lawyer and a human rights activist and his struggle in the professional, personal and societal front. Rajkumar Rao (Kai Po Che fame) is exceptional; however, a few scenes with Prabhleen Sandhu(the wife) seemed to be weird, the dialogs were umm.. unpolishedawkward. There was indeed a lack of 'chemistry'. On Googling, I found out that most of the movie dialogs were actually improvised. Perhaps Mehta was trying to keep it as real as possible, but this does work in most parts of the movie. For GOW fans, the movie also features a cameo from Tigmanshu Dhulia (Ramadhir Singh), though unnecessary. I was expecting a 'beta tumse naa hopayega', which never happens of course. K.K Menon has a small cameo too. Apart from the improvised dialogs, for me, there was nothing wrong with the movie. The Soundtrack was decent. The courtroom scenes and arguments were brilliant. The extended scene after the credits was a good touch. All in all, a must watch. Or at least google Shahid Azmi.",fictitious yet not hard believe,shahid is one those low budget movies which comes every year gets pummeled by all star studded extravagant over top commercial films premiering sept 2012 toronto film festival oct 2013 india it has been successful throughout but has not gained popularity recognition it deserves shahid deals with two very delicate subjects terrorism hindu muslim conflicts we have seen these themes explored lot movies before however this movie stands apart because it is biography almost even though message at start movie clearly mentions that its work fiction inspired real life incident nowhere movie does it seem like director or writers have exaggerated shahid is story shahid azmi lawyer human rights activist his struggle professional personal societal front rajkumar rao kai po che fame is exceptional however few scenes with prabhleen sandhu wife seemed be weird dialogs were umm unpolished awkward there was indeed lack chemistry googling i found out that most movie dialogs were actually improvised perhaps mehta was trying keep it as real as possible but this does work most parts movie gow fans movie also features cameo tigmanshu dhulia ramadhir singh though unnecessary i was expecting beta tumse naa hopayega which never happens course k k menon has small cameo too apart improvised dialogs me there was nothing wrong with movie soundtrack was decent courtroom scenes arguments were brilliant extended scene after credits was good touch all all must watch or at least google shahid azmi,0.5756172839506173,0.058858024691358014,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,"MY REVIEW: Honest, Relevant and Important!!","Shahid. Movies like Shahid are made because some stories are important and should be told with utmost honesty possible. Hansal Mehta does an excellent job with a touching and thought provoking story in his hands.Rajkumar Rao playing Shahid, first a victim and then a savior, is exceptional. Court room drama is kept simple but still succeeds in thrilling you. Family drama is there but is kept concise so that you are not distracted from the main issue. All supporting actors provide ample support to the narrative. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub playing Shahid's over burdened brother is excellent. A water tight screenplay, authentic setup, the right length, the serious tone, all make Shahid a mini masterpiece. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Shahid. Watch it with patience, watch it for its relevance and watch it because some movies are worth watching for their honest story.",my review honest relevant important,shahid movies like shahid are made because some stories are important should be told with utmost honesty possible hansal mehta does excellent job with touching thought provoking story his hands rajkumar rao playing shahid first victim then savior is exceptional court room drama is kept simple but still succeeds thrilling you family drama is there but is kept concise so that you are not distracted main issue all supporting actors provide ample support narrative mohammed zeeshan ayyub playing shahids over burdened brother is excellent water tight screenplay authentic setup right length serious tone all make shahid mini masterpiece i am going with fantastic 8 out 10 shahid watch it with patience watch it its relevance watch it because some movies are worth watching their honest story,0.6442460317460318,0.34092261904761906,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"
