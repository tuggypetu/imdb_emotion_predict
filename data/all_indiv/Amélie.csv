10.0,This is rated so highly cause it deserves it,"A slice of heaven right here on earth, ""Amelie"" is a joy to behold, and has some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen in a movie. Audrey Tatou is perfection as the title character. A combination of Audrey Hepburn, Dolly Levi and Roger Rabbit, she involves herself in the world surrounding her as a means of really enjoying living. There are moments when she finds complete and total joy just walking down the street. Some of it is hilarious, too..like when her pet goldfish habitually tries to commit suicide, or when she is on the telephone with the man at the porno shop, or when a character is asked ""Are you a congenital shmuck""?But for the most part, its a human comedy, about love, of course. Just beautiful. 10/10.",this is rated so highly cause it deserves it,slice heaven right here earth amelie is joy behold has some most gorgeous cinematography ive ever seen movie audrey tatou is perfection as title character combination audrey hepburn dolly levi roger rabbit she involves herself world surrounding her as means really enjoying living there are moments when she finds complete total joy just walking down street some it is hilarious too like when her pet goldfish habitually tries commit suicide or when she is telephone with man at porno shop or when character is asked are you congenital shmuck but most part its human comedy about love course just beautiful 10 10,0.5321626984126984,0.37125992063492064,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,Finds its charm in the little things,"'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. We have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who's hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn't look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.The movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie's life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.In short 'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie.",finds its charm little things,le fabuleux destin dam lie poulain finds its charm little things story about am lie audrey tautou is modern day fairy tale that is exactly how it looks entire film we have wonderful story about am lie who decides help people around her making them happy not by doing great big things or giving money but by little things she helps her father by making him believe that his gnome garden is trip around world she helps lonely neighbor by just visiting him she helps stranger by returning something she found her home way she falls love with nino mathieu kassovitz whos hobby it is collect photos automatic photo booths photos that were tossed away because people thought they didnt look good enough he puts all those photos pieces photos big book there is little mystery book as well course i will not spoil that you story is not only sweet charming it has some great moments comedy as well movie looks colorful bright almost constantly even sad parts am lies life her youth example look almost strangely happy this world paris actually audrey tautou is perfect inhabitant she has one those faces that seem smile entire time she looks like she just pulled joke she is waiting you find out what it is way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange short le fabuleux destin dam lie poulain is charming funny romantic bright full life this is perfect lighthearted movie,0.599561403508772,0.28947368421052627,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.15}"
10.0,What is left to say about this glorious joy ride?,"I had heard superlative comments on this film and it does not disappoint.Paris is the backdrop and what a Paris, A Paris of La Boheme and the Merry Widow. Audrey is brilliant in the role of Amelie, projecting a true joie de vivre.The film is full of surprises in both plot and characters. I left the theatre feeling lighter.

10.0,She makes ME fall in love too!,"To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.This movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!Compared to most other films ""Amelie"" (and I will stick to ""Amelie"" since ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing ""Amelie"" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us ""Alien 4"" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful ""Delicatessen"" in 1991.Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry ""Amelie"" solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.I could go on forever about ""Amelie"". It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, ""Amelie"" made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.I very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...",she makes me fall love too,start off with i heard lot good things about this movie when it was big screens but never got around see it before it disappeared sitting here long after aftermath i might never forgive myself missing that opportunity eventually i did get around see it though small tv never does film same justice theater does being bit sceptic about small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it but i must say i have never been so wrong before i am happy saying it this movies biggest crime yet its biggest asset is that it is french subtitles just does not bring full justice movie like this it is bound scare off most audience not used subtitled movies sad say so but i believe it is truth i do not know any french at all but i sure wish i was fluent watching this movie compared most other films amelie i will stick amelie since le fabuleux destin dam lie poulain is bit long write is based rather ordinary plain story everyone can relate but it is given us very special kind way mixed with wonderful little subplots almost chaotic amount details we get see experience world especially paris through filtering eyes fantasy amelie paris that might feel small limited screen but fact is just as big as it is eyes amelie director jean pierre jeunet brings life world amelie with colors masterful camerawork few special effects well i have certainly felt like melting couple times too my life some people i spoke before seeing amelie criticized it being too childish unrealistic but i believe it is essential part movie since amelie herself is very childish imaginative young girl she just happens fall love one day when she decides embark quest jean pierre jeunet manages bring us along without losing control set or plot it is exactly this kind movie that could easily be overdone lose all its magic hands wrong person but jean pierre jeunet never slips single time you who think you never heard him before he is actually same man who brought us alien 4 back 1997 i still refuse believe he was involved that horrible film wonderful delicatessen 1991 audrey tautou could not be overemphasized her importance portraying amelie i am bit embarrassed admitting it but i was almost falling love with amelie myself forgetting she was only fiction screen however she does not carry amelie solely by herself cast makes excellent whole it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting whole outcome everyone manages make most out their role even though we only get know some them briefly they come alive just as much as amelie herself does i could go forever about amelie it contains so many details switches tempo camerawork it has be seen more than once take understand everything damn it amelie made me happy laughing out loud at times very few movies affects me like that i very rarely give movies 10 i was indeed considering 9 while but me this is one those movies i will come back time after time long after cg thrills hyped fantasy movies big budget hollywood productions have faded been forgotten amelie will still be jumping around my heart doing all those silly charming little things i wish i dared do too,0.558362962962963,0.1332031746031746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"A hilarious, warm movie in a world all its own.","Not a lot of movies create their own sort of universe. Some that come to mind include ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Vertigo."" These movies are so distinct and original that they seem to have created there own spot in the universe, untouchable by anything else. You can add ""le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" to that list.Here is a film so original, so funny, and so warm that it left me with smiling for hours and the people on the sidewalk thinking I was crazy. Yes it is heart warming, but not in the phony Wal-Mart commercial sense; but in the sense of how good you feel when laughing with a dear, dear friend.The film tells the story of French waitress Amélie (Audrey Tautou.) She is in her early twenties, lead a gloomy childhood and is missing something in her life until hearing of the Death of Princess Diana causes her to drop the cap of a bottle which rolls along the floor and dislodges a tile on her bathroom wall. What she finds behind that tile leads her to the decision that she is going to do what she can to make the people around her happier by whatever means possible.Amélie goes about this with great success. One particularly wonderful scene shows Amélie helping a blind man across the street and rapidly describing what's happening around them to give him a picture of the world he doesn't get to see. This is only one in a mountain of selfless deeds she does to make people happy.As she continues enriching the lives around her, Amélie becomes challenged with the fact that if she only helps others anonymously, she may live her life alone and without the happiness she brings others.Amélie's conflict is what rounds out the picture and makes it complete. The movie is deep and takes Amélie's inner struggle seriously, but it's never heavy. Brilliantly hilarious, ""Amélie"" has a wonderfully funny script and is brought to life in visual splendor by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (""Alien: Resurrection"", of all things) and has at its center Audrey Tatou giving one of the warmest, most sincere and funniest performances you'll see this year.I can't tell you how much I love this movie. Just thinking about it gives me goose bumps and I can't wait to see it again. SEE IT IN THE THEATRE IF YOU CAN! This may be the year's best picture and is not to be missed.",hilarious warm movie world all its own,not lot movies create their own sort universe some that come mind include wizard oz american beauty vertigo these movies are so distinct original that they seem have created there own spot universe untouchable by anything else you can add le fabuleux destin dam lie poulain that list here is film so original so funny so warm that it left me with smiling hours people sidewalk thinking i was crazy yes it is heart warming but not phony wal mart commercial sense but sense how good you feel when laughing with dear dear friend film tells story french waitress am lie audrey tautou she is her early twenties lead gloomy childhood is missing something her life until hearing death princess diana causes her drop cap bottle which rolls along floor dislodges tile her bathroom wall what she finds behind that tile leads her decision that she is going do what she can make people around her happier by whatever means possible am lie goes about this with great success one particularly wonderful scene shows am lie helping blind man across street rapidly describing whats happening around them give him picture world he doesnt get see this is only one mountain selfless deeds she does make people happy as she continues enriching lives around her am lie becomes challenged with fact that if she only helps others anonymously she may live her life alone without happiness she brings others am lies conflict is what rounds out picture makes it complete movie is deep takes am lies inner struggle seriously but its never heavy brilliantly hilarious am lie has wonderfully funny script is brought life visual splendor by director jean pierre jeunet alien resurrection all things has at its center audrey tatou giving one warmest most sincere funniest performances youll see this year i cant tell you how much i love this movie just thinking about it gives me goose bumps i cant wait see it again see it theatre if you can this may be years best picture is not be missed,0.5709302325581397,0.24193093727977447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,It's my favorite movie of all time...,"Short analysis on Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie PoulainFor 20 years Jean-Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Jean-Pierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain. But it's popularity was even a surprise to Jean-Pierre Jeunet himself as he once stated: `I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection (USA 1997) to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain', obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn't win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.I consider Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film as a masterpiece. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography, the music, the story, but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one-hour and comfortable chair - our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off, we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time, to experience something totally different and yet, we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream, I will never forget.Jean-Pierre Jeunet and his camera man, Bruno Delbonnel, wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green, sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou (Amélie Poulain), mostly wears either red or green dresses, as well as the housekeeper (Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace, concierge), and Amélie's mother (Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin) in the beginning of the film. When Amélie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV, there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amélie's apartment for example is almost completely red, the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly, I haven't noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.The atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful, yet at the same time sad - slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.Camera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie's mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie's father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car. Amélie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning almost 180° around her to show her hold Nino's red bag that he lost. When Amélie sits in front of the station, we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome, not only from a technical point of view, but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.Audrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can't imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character, she lives it. It's wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job, although I want to mention the scene when Amélie's mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme close-up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director's choice, so I don't hold her responsible for that. Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when Jean-Pierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Amélie's pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer's door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key's silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn't been used very often in the film, except for showing Amélie's heart going faster and the old, blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old's man face, a close-up of Amélie's hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere. Anyway, Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long, but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions, where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal, but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minute-rescue, no time pressure, no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.In my opinion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography, the special effects or any other technical characteristics, but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story, humour, and emotion.",its my favorite movie all time,short analysis jean pierre jeunets le fabuleux destin dam lie poulainfor 20 years jean pierre jeunet collected small astonishing intriguing moments

10.0,Audrey Tautou is magical,"Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to ""normal"" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life.

10.0,This Movie can CHANGE your life :-),"A year ago, if someone would have asked me ""What is your favorite movie ?"" , I would not have known what to answer exactly, maybe Fight Club, maybe Vertigo, Indiana Jones even would have come to my mind.Since June, I have but one answer: 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' !!! It is simply unique in his kind. And now it has come out in the US, I am a bit frightened, because everybody there describes it as a simple 'feel-good movie'. It is so much more than that ! Never before has a movie INFLUENCED my life in such a way. Audrey's performance is simply stunning... she plays with an innocence, a wit, a smartness and naïvity that even someone with 40 years experience could not have done better. (please, will someone give an oscar to that girl, she makes Kidman & Blanchett look pale :-) The score from Yann Tiersen is so beautiful that by now I'm addicted to it ( I read here somewhere something about 'accordeon jingle', please, get some education ;-). The story itself could easily have been abused, and I'm sure that if Hollywood had made this movie, it would have been ridiculous, but now it is a beauty, a pearl amidst broken hearts.This movie is for everyone who understands passion or who has lost his/her childhood somewhere along the way. If you love art & music, sunshine & poetry than you are qualified for seeing this movie, be warned though...this movie can change your life (and maybe..it will ;-)! Audrey is superb, Matthieu is better than himself, every actor gives a stunning performance, the scenery is beautiful, the whole movie is amusing, entertaining and charming, even CGI is perfectly done ! 10 out of 10 !!!a 21-year-old Amélie fan who can enjoy the little things in life again",this movie can change your life,year ago if someone would have asked me what is your favorite movie i would not have known what answer exactly maybe fight club maybe vertigo indiana jones even would have come my mind since june i have but one answer le fabuleux destin dam lie poulain it is simply unique his kind now it has come out us i am bit frightened because everybody there describes it as simple feel good movie it is so much more than that never before has movie influenced my life such way audreys performance is simply stunning she plays with innocence wit smartness na vity that even someone with 40 years experience could not have done better please will someone give oscar that girl she makes kidman blanchett look pale score yann tiersen is so beautiful that by now im addicted it i read here somewhere something about accordeon jingle please get some education story itself could easily have been abused im sure that if hollywood had made this movie it would have been ridiculous but now it is beauty pearl amidst broken hearts this movie is everyone who understands passion or who has lost his her childhood somewhere along way if you love art music sunshine poetry than you are qualified seeing this movie be warned though this movie can change your life maybe it will audrey is superb matthieu is better than himself every actor gives stunning performance scenery is beautiful whole movie is amusing entertaining charming even cgi is perfectly done 10 out 10 21 year old am lie fan who can enjoy little things life again,0.6969788359788359,0.36758333333333326,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.37}"

So someone looks at the 250 best films list and rather than actually review and give any sort of subjective review, they give it a one so they can sabotage the rating. This is a charming movie. It's not for everyone, but it is creative and kind and has a wonderful love story. Criticize a away, but to call a person with a desire to do good, even if she invades the spaces of people, a psychopath! Really. I guess that's the curse of the public forum. For those actually interested in the movie, it involves a young woman who has been sheltered by her parents. When the mother is killed by a falling body, she is left to her own designs. Her father is cold and disinterested and she must fend for herself. She becomes an observer of life and begins to formulate her own being.

10.0,Amelie innocently skips stones in the canal and you realize that this deserves all the hype,"Waiting for `Amelie' to begin in a theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer, I wasn't expecting anything more than an over-hyped flick from our friends in France. I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time, a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more, and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.Possible SpoilersIt's hard to put into words how much I loved `Amelie.' I felt as though I were sitting next to Monet, watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas. I had this strange but fantastic feeling of being inside the mind of Amelie, seeing everything in the vibrant colors she viewed life with, and wanting to remain there much longer than the two hours allotted. It was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year's first installment of the same pointless drivel. I almost always loathe films with subtitles as I feel that they get in the way of viewing the characters actions and facial expressions. `Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact, had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today. Much of this can be attributed to the delightful Audrey Tatou. Her expressive eyes and sweet caring nature provided the viewer with fond memories of Audrey Hepburn and prevented me from being distracted by the subtitles. Could a 23 year old actress with little experience be just as fantastic as Meryl Streep and Katharine Hepburn? I really wasn't expecting it but Audrey Tatou revitalized my interest in film and left me wondering why her name didn't appear on Academy ballots and what possessed the Academy to favor `No Man's Land.'An already perfect film couldn't get much better but along with the lovingly created cinematography and delight of rising star Tatou came the wonderful story of a true do-gooder. `Amelie' is a film that begs you to get happy and should give some short-term contentment to even the most depressed of individuals. Little moments like the tragically funny early years of Amelie are very special and the best I've seen on the silver screen. The scene where Amelie is skipping stones in the canal should be studied for years to come as the greatest technical moment in cinema.Movies like this one don't come around very often. Perhaps the creators of films that pander to dumbed-down audiences who apparently can't tell that their watching last year's film should take the hint. The movie-going public wants to be inspired and wants to be provided with the same imagination they have when reading a great novel. This is why `Amelie' remains #18 on the list of best films.10/10",amelie innocently skips stones canal you realize that this deserves all hype,waiting amelie begin theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer i wasnt expecting anything more than over hyped flick our friends france i slowly began realize as i watched amelie skip stones canal that very first time film deserved all hype it had been accorded more i felt so blessed be part this revelation possible spoilersits hard put into words how much i loved amelie i felt as though i were sitting next monet watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas i had this strange but fantastic feeling being inside mind amelie seeing everything vibrant colors she viewed life with wanting remain there much longer than two hours allotted it was just so refreshing watch movie where your imagination was free soar rather than feel confused by apparent deja vu last years first installment same pointless drivel i almost always loathe films with subtitles as i feel that they get way viewing characters actions facial expressions amelie is first film where i adored subtitles fact had nagging urge go out learn french that is still with me today much this can be attributed delightful audrey tatou her expressive eyes sweet caring nature provided viewer with fond memories audrey hepburn prevented me being distracted by subtitles could 23 year old actress with little experience be just as fantastic as meryl streep katharine hepburn i really wasnt expecting it but audrey tatou revitalized my interest film left me wondering why her name didnt appear academy ballots what possessed academy favor no mans land already perfect film couldnt get much better but along with lovingly created cinematography delight rising star tatou came wonderful story true do gooder amelie is film that begs you get happy should give some short term contentment even most depressed individuals little moments like tragically funny early years amelie are very special best ive seen silver screen scene where amelie is skipping stones canal should be studied years come as greatest technical moment cinema movies like this one dont come around very often perhaps creators films that pander dumbed down audiences who apparently cant tell that their watching last years film should take hint movie going public wants be inspired wants be provided with same imagination they have when reading great novel this is why amelie remains list best films 10 10,0.48844576719576727,0.28806216931216927,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"

9.0,Just plain weird...and I mean that in a good way.,"Considering that there are a bazillion reviews for this film already, I really don't think it's that important that I do an in-depth review of this film. It is already well in the top 100 films on IMDb, so it's obviously a very good film.Instead of the usual view of the film, I'll talk about it from a psychological perspective. Amélie is a nice lady who is severely hindered by an Avoidant Personality. This means that she's so worried about being rejected by others that she always keeps her distance from them--particularly anyone who could become intimate. In other words, instead of being actively involved with others, she lives a life of quiet desperation--hoping that somehow things will work themselves out but completely terrified to act. So, she sublimates her energy into doing things to help others--but always at a distance and anonymously. Most of the things she does for others are very quirky and strange--but ultimately very helpful and kind. In one of the cases, however, she attempts to gain retribution for an emotionally abused young man through passive-aggressive actions. Fortunately for her, she meets a man who is also Avoidant (his hobby is very detached yet shows an interest in others)...but how can two such obvious misfits who are afraid of commitment find a way to connect?! Aside from the psychological aspects of the film, I really appreciated the look of the film. The odd 1930s style of Amélie's clothing and the homes in the film, the choice of colors (with lots of sepia tones), the cinematic tricks and the quirky little gimmicks (such as the pictures and lamp in her room coming to life) all help to make this a magical picture that you cannot forget.Overall, a delight. Oddly, however, despite the very high rating, I think that Audrey Tautou mas made better films, such as HE LOVES ME...HE LOVES ME NOT and A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT.",just plain weird i mean that good way,considering that there are bazillion reviews this film already i really dont think its that important that i do depth review this film it is already well top 100 films imdb so its obviously very good film instead usual view film ill talk about it psychological perspective am lie is nice lady who is severely hindered by avoidant personality this means that shes so worried about being rejected by others that she always keeps her distance them particularly anyone who could become intimate other words instead being actively involved with others she lives life quiet desperation hoping that somehow things will work themselves out but completely terrified act so she sublimates her energy into doing things help others but always at distance anonymously most things she does others are very quirky strange but ultimately very helpful kind one cases however she attempts gain retribution emotionally abused young man through passive aggressive actions fortunately her she meets man who is also avoidant his hobby is very detached yet shows interest others but how can two such obvious misfits who are afraid commitment find way connect aside psychological aspects film i really appreciated look film odd 1930s style am lies clothing homes film choice colors with lots sepia tones cinematic tricks quirky little gimmicks such as pictures lamp her room coming life all help make this magical picture that you cannot forget overall delight oddly however despite very high rating i think that audrey tautou mas made better films such as he loves me he loves me not very long engagement,0.5094667073667074,0.08439877899877901,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"
,Wittily observed and quirky romance that's imaginative and sweet,"Amélie grows up a slightly introverted child as a result of her unusual parents. When she grows up she has her own unusual habits and quirks. When she finds a hidden box of childhood toys in her house she decides to track down the owner and return it to him. Seeing the happiness that she brings to him she resolves to work in secret to make other people happy. However can she be happy herself?I wasn't sure what to expect with this film - I'd heard others raving on the boards about it but didn't even know the most basic of plot details about it, I didn't even know who the director was. When the opening credits rolled and I saw that it was Jeunet as director I immediately realised that this may not be as straightforward as I had thought. Almost immediately, the different humour comes through in lots of ways - from little things like the way the cameras moves up to the full script. The plot doesn't totally work and some of the strands are a little unclear, but overall the film really works well as an alternative romance that is as sweet as it is quirky.The influence of Jeunet is the main reason the film works as well as it does. He tones down his usual darker style and delivers something just as different and unusual but much lighter and refreshing. As writer he does a great job coming up with imaginative characters and situations. The other reason it works so well is through the performance of Tautou; she is such a wide eyed innocent - sweet without being sickly and likable without taking away from her quirkiness. The support cast are all good and features a few Jeunet regulars but really it is Tautou's film and she carries it well thanks to the great work of the director.Overall this is a surprisingly sweet film that took me by surprise and was sweetly charming and lovely without falling into cliché - it was different and quirky in a refreshingly enjoyable way.

9.0,One of the Sweetest and Most Original Movies of Cinema History,"In 1974, in Enghien in the northern suburbs of Paris, the girl Amélie Poulain was born and raised alone by her cold hearted father and her stressed mother due to a mistake of her father's evaluation of her heart conditions.

8.0,A nice little film,"Rating: ***1/2 out of ****What a fun film! From the moment it begins, ""Amelie"" bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. ""Amelie"" is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well. Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a nave girl working at the Two Windmills Caf. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers). I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical ""Bells Are Ringing"", with our heroine bringing so much life to those around her but neglecting her wants and needs.After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role. Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for ""Amelie"". The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery. With films like ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"", ""With a Friend Like Harry"" and box-office hit ""Brotherhood of the Wold"", French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with ""Amelie"", a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world.",nice little film,rating 1 2 out what fun film moment it begins amelie bursts with joy energy its fable sorts love letter paris fondly dreamt by many it may not be real world but it is such delightful fantasy that it doesnt matter how unbelievable some it may be amelie is rare romantic comedy that has both romance comedy it isnt very surprising that this has been hit france while now i have no doubt it will find audience it needs states as well amelie poulain audrey tautou is nave girl working at two windmills caf when she was child her mother teacher was innocent victim suicide gone awry amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough leave lead life her own one day she finds small box treasures behind tile her wall she decides return it her owner become natural do gooder later she catches man groping lost photos under photo booth nino quincampoix played by mathieu kassovitz its love at first sight she decides go quest find this man help anyone she can along way including her father co workers i said before that this film was love letter paris it is also love letter amelie herself jean pierre jeunet director co screenwriter conjured film like dream as if amelie is his dream girl he is trying save her bring her happy ending its not hard want everything work out her her friends amelie poulain is kind person who you wish was your best friend your neighbor or your sister she bounces along with good grace whimsy living life its fullest yet keeping mischievous grin she has her own idea justice that isnt very disagreeable tormentors must turn be tormented lifeless must be brought life film is like non musical bells are ringing with our heroine bringing so much life those around her but neglecting her wants needs after seeing audrey tautou as amelie i cant possibly imagine anyone else that role she embodies amelie like no one else could she is rare find that pulls off job breathing life into amelie spades wait i take that back she does not just breathe life into amelie tautou makes her jump off screen pull audience into story it would be crime her not get best actress nomination her role magical is world that amelie lives where photos lamps come alive aid her quest where tv shows are showing nothing but her story story this setting surrounds is pretty standard presented plainly could have just been another machine processed romantic comedy is it too sappy no contrary film takes quite few steps make sure it doesnt become tacky or conventional rich storybook setting witty screenplay asides are taken deepen our connection each character little things that each likes dislikes make film all more delight watch cinematography crafted by bruno delbonnel does wonders amelie camera captures action with eye child candy store beautifully bringing about each shot as new discovery with films like widow saint pierre with friend like harry box office hit brotherhood wold french cinema has had quite year its delight that we round off year with amelie fresh funny journey that could have easily just been more meg ryan esque romantic comedy fodder if not anything else see it tautous performance but prepare be smothered dream world,0.5351754506516412,0.27132361025218166,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,Brilliant Colors,"If ever I needed a movie dubbed, this one would be it. Normally, I prefer subtitles, but the visuals in here are so incredible that trying to read the subtitles distracts me from taking in all there is to see.Man, there is a lot to see: brilliant, beautiful colors in scene-after-scene. They alone make this DVD worth owning. The story is decent, pretty interesting but nothing super. The humor is ""French,"" meaning different from what we normally laugh at in North America. The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade. If you've watched it, you know what I mean.However, this is so uniquely and beautifully filmed that I can put up with a so-so story. As the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, is cute and fun to watch and the addition of humor to the romance story helps. There is almost no profanity in here and a few very quick nude shots which must be the reason for the ""R"" rating, otherwise it would be an easy ""PG."" In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes.",brilliant colors,if ever i needed movie dubbed this one would be it normally i prefer subtitles but visuals here are so incredible that trying read subtitles distracts me taking all there is see man there is lot see brilliant beautiful colors scene after scene they alone make this dvd worth owning story is decent pretty interesting but nothing super humor is french meaning different what we normally laugh at north america story also be honest gets frustrating after awhile as amelie goes too long with her charade if youve watched it you know what i mean however this is so uniquely beautifully filmed that i can put up with so so story as lead actress audrey tautou is cute fun watch addition humor romance story helps there is almost no profanity here few very quick nude shots which must be reason r rating otherwise it would be easy pg summary pleasant film that is feast eyes,0.6592013888888889,0.35156249999999994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.16}"

6.0,"Cotton Candy, not the real stuff","I cannot understand why so many users are raving about this film. Yes, it is original. Yes, the lead actress is cute and holds your attention. Yes, the other characters are bizarre and sometimes funny. But REALLY !!!! This is one of the highest rated films on imdb? I have been a movie geek for almost 50 years, and this did NOT even remotely jump out at me as an all-time great film. It is enjoyable fluff, nothing more. Did it make me feel good about life? No. I already was OK when I watched it, and it didn't move me, touch me in any real way. I expected so much more, from all the reviews. I was disappointed.It is like cotton candy as opposed to homemade chocolate. French cinema has produced much better than this. Jules & Jim, Z, 400 Blows, Manon of the Spring, to name a few.",cotton candy not real stuff,i cannot understand why so many users are raving about this film yes it is original yes lead actress is cute holds your attention yes other characters are bizarre sometimes funny but really this is one highest rated films imdb i have been movie geek almost 50 years this did not even remotely jump out at me as all time great film it is enjoyable fluff nothing more did it make me feel good about life no i already was ok when i watched it it didnt move me touch me any real way i expected so much more all reviews i was disappointed it is like cotton candy as opposed homemade chocolate french cinema has produced much better than this jules jim z 400 blows manon spring name few,0.48750000000000004,0.225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.08}"
3.0,A psychiatric cocktail of lunacy,"Please do not be fooled: Amelie is sick in the head. The titular character has very palpable schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive dissorder and I believe some autism too.She behaves more like an alien in a flesh suit, than a person. The world she lives in is brightly overexposed, yellow, sacharine and tragically depressing. She belongs in a nuthouse, and the movie should be a documentary about her lunacy. I know she is not a real person and a movie character, but someone please end her suffering.",psychiatric cocktail lunacy,please do not be fooled amelie is sick head titular character has very palpable schizophrenia obsessive compulsive dissorder i believe some autism too she behaves more like alien flesh suit than person world she lives is brightly overexposed yellow sacharine tragically depressing she belongs nuthouse movie should be documentary about her lunacy i know she is not real person movie character but someone please end her suffering,0.48571428571428565,-0.03642857142857142,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.0, 'Sad': 0.43, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5.0,Style Over Substance,"The story of Amelie will either grab you or it won't. Certainly this is one of the greatest looking films, with a witty frantic style that is a pleasure to look at simply because there is so much to look at. Those wanting to study how to make a film from a visual stand point should put this on the list of films to study.The story is a mixed bag. I know many people who have watched this film and fell in love with its quirky romance and view of life. I on the other hand was pained from the get go, finding its attempts at humor severely lacking in everything even in the ability to even make me crack a smile. To me it wants to be applauded for being off center instead of being good.Try it, you may like it, or you maybe like me and wonder what all the shouting is about.",style over substance,story amelie will either grab you or it wont certainly this is one greatest looking films with witty frantic style that is pleasure look at simply because there is so much look at those wanting study how make film visual stand point should put this list films study story is mixed bag i know many people who have watched this film fell love with its quirky romance view life i other hand was pained get go finding its attempts at humor severely lacking everything even ability even make me crack smile me it wants be applauded being off center instead being good try it you may like it or you maybe like me wonder what all shouting is about,0.4502380952380952,0.2592857142857143,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
