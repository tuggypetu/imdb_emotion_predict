10.0,"One of the best films noir ever, Double Indemnity communicates with amazing effectiveness the depths of depravity, greed, lust, and betrayal of the seemingly innocent and beautiful.","This is one of the best films of all time, not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting, direction, cinematography, lighting, and just the way that the story itself was told. At the time the film was released, the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of, but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film, which was the goal of Billy Wilder, the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was, there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off, what mistakes were made during the murder, who betrayed who, how close Barton Keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case, and, probably most importantly, what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him. Barbara Stanwyck, in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career, represents (with nearly flawless ease) the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways (including death, if necessary) in order to get what she wants. Known in the film community as the `femme fatale,' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess, seductiveness, and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person (generally an interested man) into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. In these types of films, the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead, as is often (but not always) also the case with the fate of the femme fatale. Barbara Stanwyck (as Phyllis Dietrichson, the murderous femme fatale in Double Indemnity) and Fred MacMurray (as Walter Neff, her Â‘victim'), have amazing chemistry on screen. Their attraction is incredibly well portrayed, and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. Besides that, their mutually calculated interaction, although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen, is exactly as it was meant to be, because it represents each character's intentions, even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. Phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to Walter in her head. She has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to Walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. Walter, conversely, methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly, and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with Phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. This seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents Phyllis and Walter's precise (and sinister) intentions, and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.Probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film, Edward G. Robinson, plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. Keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company, having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. His handling of Phyllis's (and Walter's, technically) claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama. Double Indemnity is nearly flawless. From the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end, the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances, the brilliant and imaginative direction, and the flawlessly created atmosphere. This is excellent, excellent filmmaking, and is a classic film that should not be missed.",one best films noir ever double indemnity communicates with amazing effectiveness depths depravity greed lust betrayal seemingly innocent beautiful,this is one best films all time not necessarily because its story but because acting direction cinematography lighting just way that story itself was told at time film was released idea revealing who killer was opening scene was virtually unheard but it ended up being very effective because it allowed audience concentrate more other elements film which was goal billy wilder director instead trying figure out who perpetrator was there is more emphasis how crime was pulled off what mistakes were made during murder who betrayed who how close barton keyes insurance investigator was getting solving case probably most importantly what kind person walter neff is whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him barbara stanwyck one most remembered performances her extensive career represents with nearly flawless ease cold ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty ruining other peoples lives various ways including death if necessary order get what she wants known film community as femme fatale this is someone who uses her sexual prowess seductiveness emotional detachment drag unsuspecting person generally interested man into scheme which she is expected benefit heavily he is most likely headed destruction these types films man often either finds his life ruins or ends up dead as is often but not always also case with fate femme fatale barbara stanwyck as phyllis dietrichson murderous femme fatale double indemnity fred macmurray as walter neff her victim have amazing chemistry screen their attraction is incredibly well portrayed development their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal besides that their mutually calculated interaction although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly ultimately brought unconvincingly screen is exactly as it was meant be because it represents each characters intentions even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other phyllis has gone through every word she ever says walter her head she has practiced what she wants say when she brings up idea life insurance walter beginning she knows what she wants say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning quite some time prospect murdering her husband order collect his fortune walter conversely methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with phyllis because he begins suspect her is sure tell her only what he wants her hear this seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents phyllis walters precise sinister intentions its quick pace creates feeling urgency restlessness probably most fascinating entertaining actor film edward g robinson plays barton keyes walters friend employer at insurance company where he works keyes is very suspicious man who closely investigates insurance claims which come into company having striking history accurately isolating fraudulent claims throwing them out his handling phylliss walters technically claim way that he gets closer closer truth create great atmosphere tension drama double indemnity is nearly flawless shocking unexpected beginning already known but still surprising end audience is held rapt by excellent performances brilliant imaginative direction flawlessly created atmosphere this is excellent excellent filmmaking is classic film that should not be missed,0.6023625987233582,0.27382760699216396,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Justifiably At The Top Of Most Film Noir Lists,"This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.Few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.....at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I think it's a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as ""cheesy.""I read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film's snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,For a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.Stanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, ""Body Heat,"" starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one.",justifiably at top most film noir lists,this is one best liked classic films all time i am among that large group fans as well few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining at least conversations between barbara stanwyck fred macmurray i think its big appeal this movie except younger folks who look at it as cheesy i read book double indemnity written by james cain was surprised that films snappy dialog was not it this is one rare times when movie was far better than book thats not shock after you find out that literary giant raymond chandler hall fame director billy wilder combined write screenplay murder suspense story there is very little action almost none yet there are no boring lulls three main actors stanwyck macmurray edward g robinson are what make this so good macmurrays narration is fun hear as he tells story flashback beginning by dictating into old dictaphone his co worker robinson latter is almost mesmerizing his performance way he delivers his lines he can even make speech about something as boring as insurance still keep you riveted screen stanwyck was no sex symbol at least me but she looked great here most seductive 1940s clothing like robinson has distinctive voice accent that keeps your attention this film was inspiration 1980 movie body heat starring william hurt kathleen turner that too was very very good movie but not many films are class this one,0.5031932773109243,0.18129026610644258,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.21}"
8.0,"Absorbing and worthy suspense film about blackmails , killing , corruption and strong intrigue","Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings , crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder's first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby's policy contains a clause that states that if the husband's death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator's boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .This first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain's novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film's script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn't really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson's initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn't keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler's cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for Â¨Body heatÂ¨ by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber .",absorbing worthy suspense film about blackmails killing corruption strong intrigue,vintage noir film with gritty interpretation atmospheric settings crackling dialogue throughout powerhouse filmmaking this billy wilders first thriller is one finest noir film ever made scheming wife barbara stanwyck lures insurance salesman fred macmurray though alan ladd george raft brian donlevy james cagney spencer tracy gregory peck fredric march were all up leading role into helping murder her husband then declare it accident both whom concoct twisted scheme collect benefits insurance policy as hubbys policy contains clause that states that if husbands death caused by moving train policy pays double face value investigators boss edward g robinson not knowing his colleague is involved it suspects murder sets out prove it this first rate entertaining american classic noir film draws its riveting tale power interaction finely drawn roles as well as drama emotion moody atmosphere this classic mystery thriller follows james m cains book fairly closely otherwise twisted film noir about murder troubled relationships treason dark secrets including unforgettable dialog being based james m cains novel which turn was based true story ruth snyder subject notorious 1920s murder trial being screen written by prestigious raymond chandler same billy wilder however billy wilder raymond chandler did not get along well while writing this films script process that was apparently filled with arguments as billy wilder didnt really get with famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated director it packs good realization original script haunting atmosphere intriguing events that reason madness murder prevail fred macmurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot barbara stanwick as predatory alluring femme fatale is magnificent here his colleague edward g robinson is extraordinary as cool as ever he plays as astute stubborn investigator his scenes with fred macmurray are awesome at their best but edward g robinsons initial reluctance sign largely stemmed fact he wasnt keen being demoted third lead good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as porter hall tom powers jean heather byron barr fortunio bonanova raymond chandlers cameo this marks only film appearance screenwriter novelist raymond chandler exciting as well as complex film possessing mysterious fascinating blend gripping thriller serenity baroque suspense which especially stands out portentous performances evocative cinematography black white by john f seitz thrilling musical score by classic miklos rozsa motion picture was stunningly directed by great billy wilder as american film institute ranked this as greatest movie all time film was nominated 7 academy awards but lost out night going my way 1944 by leo mccarey it got deep inspiration other films it is particularly obvious body heat by lawrence kasdan with william hurt kathleen turner richard crenna remade tv 1954 by buzz kulik with frank lovejoy ray collins laraine day 1973 tv remake 1940s classic by jack smight with richard crenna samantha eggar robert webber,0.587826420890937,0.2526497695852534,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"Some times, when they least expect it.....","There are occasional times when all the elements come together to make a great film that will stand the passing of time. ""Double Indemnity"" seems to be an example of this phenomenon.First, there was a great novel by one of America's best mystery writers, James Cain, who created these characters that seem will live forever in our imagination. Then, the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it, Billy Wilder, a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler, a man who knew about the genre.""Double Indemnity"" works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage, who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator, Phyllis Dietrichson, doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about, thinking he is doing something else, will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try, with disastrous results. The director, who was working under the old Hays Code, shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors, yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.In life, as well as in fiction, there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First, there i Jackson, the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train, contemplating the passing landscape. Then, no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys, the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.We try to make a point to take a look at ""Double Indemnity"" when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.Edgar G. Robinson, as Barton Keys, makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is, in a way, Walter's worst nightmare, because working next to Keys, he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines, Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz, who will go on to direct films, is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.This film shows a great man at his best: Billy Wilder!",some times when they least expect it,there are occasional times when all elements come together make great film that will stand passing time double indemnity seems be example this phenomenon first there was great novel by one americas best mystery writers james cain who created these characters that seem will live forever our imagination then lucky break getting right man direct it billy wilder man who knew about how make classic out material that he adapted with great care elegance with raymond chandler man who knew about genre double indemnity works because its story we can relate there is greedy woman trapped bad marriage who sees opportunity when she encounters insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her who has only sex his mind manipulator phyllis dietrichson doesnt need much see how walter desires her his idea having her husband sign insurance policy he knows nothing about thinking he is doing something else will prove fatal flaw judgment mr wilder achieves this film what others try with disastrous results director who was working under old hays code shows so much sex film with fully clothed actors yet one feels heat exuding passion walter neff feels phyllis he is man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by promise what his life will be once husband is out picture life as well as fiction there are small insignificant things that will derail best laid plans first there i jackson man who shouldnt have been smoking at rear train contemplating passing landscape then no one counts ability barton keys man agency who has seen it all walter phyllis didnt take that into consideration it will backfire their plan we try make point take look at double indemnity when it shows cable time time barbara stanwyck makes magnificent phyllis there are no false movements her performance phyllis gets under walters skin because she knows where her priorities lie makes good use them order render walter helpless under her spell fred mcmurray makes perfect walter he is consumed by his passion he will do anything because what he perceives will be reward doing crime walter neff was perhaps mr mcmurrays best creation he is completely believable vulnerable edgar g robinson as barton keys makes one his best performances screen keys is man that has seen all schemes pass by his desk he is way walters worst nightmare because working next keys he gets know how wrong he was planning crime supporting cast is excellent porter hall jean heather tom powers richard gaines fortunio buonanova john philliber are perfect music score miklos rosza gives film texture dimension that capitalizes action it intends enhance also music cesar franck franz schubert contribute atmosphere movie great cinematography john seitz who will go direct films is another asset movie edith heads costumes are absolutely what woman like phyllis would wear right down her ankle bracelet this film shows great man at his best billy wilder,0.4913607804232804,0.27192159692159695,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,It fits together like a watch,"I've now seen this movie 14 times in 25 years, at all times of the year, in all moods, sober or not etc - but always at night. I recorded my copy off TV in 1987 so I can only imagine what a remaster would do for it. With an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife it never fails to engross and enchant me, and although it's been dated for 40 years or more still seems relevant and watchable today. TV, answer phones, recordable CD/DVD, memory sticks and the internet have all come between us and yet I can still watch Fred MacMurray speaking into a Dictaphone without a qualm. Who wears a hat in California nowadays? Who buys beer whilst driving! Lift attendants have gone but I can still believe in Charlie working and laughing away in the garage past 11 at night.Woman and man agree to murder woman's husband but on the way to the cemetery they face grilling by insurance company. I think everything has been said before on the IMDb - by those who think it's one of the best films ever made! To those who simply think the main problem is that it's dated I wish you could see the TV commercials that dug into DI back in '87 - what a hoot - and compare. I've just noticed the print TCM UK is showing in 2005 is lip-synced out, very wobbly Rosza music track, fading and ageing fast - worse than my 1987 video tape (maybe logically). They're supposed to be encouraging people to enjoy the classics but they won't do that with such inferior screening copies. Dear TCM UK, this is an impressive iconic film - it deserves a billion dollar remaster authorised by the Library of Congress, not repeatedly trotting out unimpressive cheap worn dupes to fill those 2 hour slots.Everything about DI from the acting, production, direction, and music is superbly dignified and is as ""close to perfection"" as human beings are probably allowed to get with this form of Art - especially with the more limited technology at their disposal in '44. When most films from now are long forgotten and dated DI will still be getting re-runs on TV and art-house cinemas - God and remasters willing - that is the fact of it.Fortunia Bonanova certainly was fortunate to have appeared in bit parts in 2 of the best films ever made - Citizen Kane the other.",it fits together like watch,ive now seen this movie 14 times 25 years at all times year all moods sober or not etc but always at night i recorded my copy off tv 1987 so i can only imagine what remaster would do it with atmosphere thick enough cut with knife it never fails engross enchant me although its been dated 40 years or more still seems relevant watchable today tv answer phones recordable cd dvd memory sticks internet have all come between us yet i can still watch fred macmurray speaking into dictaphone without qualm who wears hat california nowadays who buys beer whilst driving lift attendants have gone but i can still believe charlie working laughing away garage past 11 at night woman man agree murder womans husband but way cemetery they face grilling by insurance company i think everything has been said before imdb by those who think its one best films ever made those who simply think main problem is that its dated i wish you could see tv commercials that dug into di back 87 what hoot compare ive just noticed print tcm uk is showing 2005 is lip synced out very wobbly rosza music track fading ageing fast worse than my 1987 video tape maybe logically theyre supposed be encouraging people enjoy classics but they wont do that with such inferior screening copies dear tcm uk this is impressive iconic film it deserves billion dollar remaster authorised by library congress not repeatedly trotting out unimpressive cheap worn dupes fill those 2 hour slots everything about di acting production direction music is superbly dignified is as close perfection as human beings are probably allowed get with this form art especially with more limited technology at their disposal 44 when most films now are long forgotten dated di will still be getting re runs tv art house cinemas god remasters willing that is fact it fortunia bonanova certainly was fortunate have appeared bit parts 2 best films ever made citizen kane other,0.48249299719887945,0.23630952380952386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,"Movie Heaven, Baby","Barbara Stanwyck changed the trajectory of her career with her ruthless, icy performance here. Fred MacMurray, however, would never again allow himself to duplicate anything similar to Walter Neff's troubled, doomed portrayal again on screen. Playing against their dark alliance, it is left to Edward G. Robinson to win the audience over as he struggles to shed light on the insurance fraud and murder. This script should be studied by anyone who plans to write for TV or movies. Note the significant changes Wilder and Chandler made from James Cain's original novel - changes Cain admitted were improvements.

9.0,you just can't find snappier dialog,"Wow--this movie had the absolute snappiest dialog of any Film Noir movie in Hollywood history. For dialog alone and Fred MacMurray's voice-overs, this must rank as one of the best Noir films of all time. The words they say are all so carefully chosen and magnificent--the writers really did their work well. And, the acting and direction are excellent as well. About the only reason I don't score it a 10 (and it sure came very close) was that, for Film Noir, there wasn't a whole lot of action or even suspense in the movie--considering you KNOW that MacMurray is making a confession so he isn't going to get away with the murder plot. Still, these are VERY minor complaints--the film is simply great.

8.0,A Noir Classic,"Author James M. Cain virtually created a new genre with his extra-tough, sin-blackened, and sex-drenched novels--and they were so successful with the public that not even 1940s Hollywood could resist. The result was three of the most famous films of that decade: MILDRED PIERCE, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Although POSTMAN is probably the better film, INDEMNITY is the most famous--possibly due to the story's truly psychotic edge, which is given full life by Barbara Stanwyck in one of her most celebrated performances.Like POSTMAN, INDEMNITY offers the story of a married woman who plots with her lover to murder her husband. Given MacMurray's typically ""good guy"" image, I didn't expect to believe him in the role of Walter Neff in the role of skirt-hungry Walter Neff--but MacMurray's performance is exceptionally good here, and all the more effective because it so completely unexpected. But while MacMurray has most of the screen time, it is really Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson who dominate the film. Stanwyck is truly memorable here, and gives us a woman who seems at once sexed-up and completely frigid, at once completely natural and absolutely artificial. It is a remarkable and often disturbing effect. Robinson, who endured decades of type-casting, is equally good as the blustery, slightly comic, and absolutely honest insurance man whose job it is to ferret out suspicious claims; it is largely due to his performance, which gives the film a moral center, that we are able to buy into the otherwise off-beat performances that drive the action.This was one of director Billy Wilder's first major hits, and he deserves considerable credit for making the weird elements of the story work as a whole, keeping the film smartly paced, and heaping it up with atmosphere.

7.0,Do you drive a new Cadillac to appear inconspicuous at crime scene,Everyone knows this film and everyone loves it.I tried to observe some flaws if there are any in it. The actress playing the daughter looked too old for the role. Stanwyck was 37 when this was made and Mc Murray was 36.I agree with the reviewer who stated Mc Murray's later roles in TV sit coms and so forth tainted his image. It's true it was hard to take him seriously.A new Cadillac driving around the rail road tracks might attract some notice especially in 1939 (the year this is supposed to take place).Also you have to suspend disbelief that Mc Murray would be so smitten by Stanwyck he would attempt anything like this. She is not especially at 37 (or any age!) the most attractive woman in the world. The blond wig? I guess was supposed to make her look ?? maybe cheap or tainted. She can carry any role though plouging through it like a bulldozer.But these are so minor. I loved the movie watch it and read the other reviews.RECOMMEND HIGHLY,do you drive new cadillac appear inconspicuous at crime scene,everyone knows this film everyone loves it i tried observe some flaws if there are any it actress playing daughter looked too old role stanwyck was 37 when this was made mc murray was 36 i agree with reviewer who stated mc murrays later roles tv sit coms so forth tainted his image its true it was hard take him seriously new cadillac driving around rail road tracks might attract some notice especially 1939 year this is supposed take place also you have suspend disbelief that mc murray would be so smitten by stanwyck he would attempt anything like this she is not especially at 37 or any age most attractive woman world blond wig i guess was supposed make her look maybe cheap or tainted she can carry any role though plouging through it like bulldozer but these are so minor i loved movie watch it read other reviews recommend highly,0.561050505050505,0.18773737373737376,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.48}"
10.0,Quintessential film noir,"Billy Wilder had directed some wonderful movies, Some Like it Hot, Sunset Boulevard, Sabrina, The Apartment and Witness for the Prosecution are all fantastic. Double Indemnity is up there with his very best. Wilder directs impeccably, but his direction is not the only great thing about Double Indemnity. Everything is great about it, it is a timeless classic and defines the term quintessential film noir.The cinematography is gorgeous with no rough edges or shaky moments, instead it is all fluid and beautiful, and the costumes, sets and scenery also help. Also superb are Miklos Rozsa's wonderfully atmospheric score, the compelling story which sizzles with romance and sexual tension and the truly crackling screenplay.The acting also is impressive. Fred MacMurray overplays slightly, but this is one of the cases when overplaying works, because he is still witty and charming as well. Barbara Stanwyck I think is sexy, her character appeals and her dialogue is so good as is her delivery of it, while Edward G.Robinson gives a superb supporting performance.All in all, a stunning film and one of the very best of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",quintessential film noir,billy wilder had directed some wonderful movies some like it hot sunset boulevard sabrina apartment witness prosecution are all fantastic double indemnity is up there with his very best wilder directs impeccably but his direction is not only great thing about double indemnity everything is great about it it is timeless classic defines term quintessential film noir cinematography is gorgeous with no rough edges or shaky moments instead it is all fluid beautiful costumes sets scenery also help also superb are miklos rozsas wonderfully atmospheric score compelling story which sizzles with romance sexual tension truly crackling screenplay acting also is impressive fred macmurray overplays slightly but this is one cases when overplaying works because he is still witty charming as well barbara stanwyck i think is sexy her character appeals her dialogue is so good as is her delivery it while edward g robinson gives superb supporting performance all all stunning film one very best genre 10 10 bethany cox,0.62247311827957,0.4586021505376344,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10.0,I Wonder if you Wonder,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""I wonder if you wonder."" Every time I hear Walter Neff say those words to Phyllis Dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes, I smile and settle in for another round of Double Indemnity (1944) ... one of my all-time favorites. Though I have seen it many times over the years, I recently saw it for the first time on the big screen ... and from a 35mm print! So much of the subtle filmmaking becomes apparent - the variance of lighting, the intensity of shadows, and the vividness of close-ups. This reinforces my belief that we should never miss an opportunity to view good films in a theatre setting ... just as the director intended.Since this film was released 67 years ago, it's difficult to discuss without noting a key plot point or character reaction. If you haven't seen it and plan to, you might stop reading here. If you would like a little insight, then let's keep going. Billy Wilder (left) directed the film and his place as a Hollywood legend is quite secure. He was nominated for 21 Oscars (Director, Writer, Producer) and had 3 wins. Some of his classics are: The Lost Weekend, Sunset Blvd, Witness for the Prosecution, Some Like it Hot, The Apartment, The Front Page. Many think of Wilder as a comedic filmmaker and he certainly had success in that genre, but if you watch closely, even his comedies have a dark element to them.Double Indemnity is based on the novella by James M Cain, who also wrote Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Wilder was a fan of Cain's book, but knew the dialogue wouldn't work well on screen. So together with Raymond Chandler they wrote a screenplay filled with crackling lines and a constant feeling of dread and pending doom. As great as the script is, it is heightened by a wonderful cast that includes Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G Robinson, Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines and Byron Barr.For me, MacMurray's performance is what brings the words to life and jumps the film to the ""must see"" category. He is playing against two Hollywood heavyweights in Stanwyck and Robinson, but we are somehow sympathetic to this not-so-bright guy who gets played like a fiddle by the villainous, wily woman he lusts after. Even as he is recording his confession, a part of us understands how he got drawn into MURDER! Not just any murder, but one for money and love ... only there is no money, and there is no love.Ms. Stanwyck is perfectly cast as the femme fatale who weaves her web of deceit and destruction. She quickly spots the vulnerability of MacMurray's character and uses her assets just enough to hold the leash tight. It is a testament to her screen presence that she can pull off the sultry siren while sporting a less-than-desirable blonde wig. At the time, the wig was so controversial that the producers compared it to George Washington and wanted it trashed. However, filming was too far along and now it's impossible to imagine her looking any other way. Besides, MacMurray only seems to notice her anklet!Edward G Robinson made a name for himself as a tough-guy actor ... cop and mobster all rolled into one. Here he plays the insurance investigator with a sixth-sense for fraudulent claims. He is a hard-nosed, dedicated employee who takes his responsibility very seriously and has no sympathy for those who cheat his cherished system. He has a soft spot for co-worker MacMurray, even though he is one of the back-slapping salesmen he so loathes. Their relationship in the film is one of respect and about as close as two professional men could be, given the era. When Robinson goes off on his rant about suicide research, he is a joy to behold. This guy could flat chew scenery.In addition to the infamous wig, you might also notice that MacMurray is wearing a wedding band throughout the film, even though his character is clearly a single man. Wilder and MacMurray stated many times over the years that was simply a mistake and not ""caught"" until post-production. Expect a chuckle when MacMurray, as the narrator, enviously describes a Spanish style Los Angeles home as costing $30,000 ... probably less than the property taxes would be on that house today. The film originally was to end with MacMurray in the Gas Chamber and Robinson looking on (inset), but this was deemed inappropriate. One last little nugget: early in the film, MacMurray walks out of Robinson's office and past a man sitting on a hallway chair reading a paperback book. That man? Raymond Chandler, in his only on screen appearance.The film is often described as quintessential Film Noir. Another prime example of Film Noir would be The Big Sleep (1946), based on a Raymond Chandler novel, directed by Howard Hawks, and starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While Film Noir might not be an easily definable term, there are certain elements that must be present. Lighting is key. Shadows must be prevalent. Some type of detective story is usually at the center, and we typically get some poor schlub of a guy being yanked around by the femme fatale. The right ""mood"" is essential ... as a viewer we know things are headed down the wrong path, but we just can't save the characters from their own poor choices. But neither can we look away. That helpless feeling is a strong indicator that you just watched a terrific Film Noir.",i wonder if you wonder,greetings again darkness i wonder if you wonder every time i hear walter neff say those words phyllis dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes i smile settle another round double indemnity 1944 one my all time favorites though i have seen it many times over years i recently saw it first time big screen 35mm print so much subtle filmmaking becomes apparent variance lighting intensity shadows vividness close ups this reinforces my belief that we should never miss opportunity view good films theatre setting just as director intended since this film was released 67 years ago its difficult discuss without noting key plot point or character reaction if you havent seen it plan you might stop reading here if you would like little insight then lets keep going billy wilder left directed film his place as hollywood legend is quite secure he was nominated 21 oscars director writer producer had 3 wins some his classics are lost weekend sunset blvd witness prosecution some like it hot apartment front page many think wilder as comedic filmmaker he certainly had success that genre but if you watch closely even his comedies have dark element them double indemnity is based novella by james m cain who also wrote mildred pierce postman always rings twice wilder was fan cains book but knew dialogue wouldnt work well screen so together with raymond chandler they wrote screenplay filled with crackling lines constant feeling dread pending doom as great as script is it is heightened by wonderful cast that includes fred macmurray barbara stanwyck edward g robinson porter hall jean heather tom powers richard gaines byron barr me macmurrays performance is what brings words life jumps film must see category he is playing against two hollywood heavyweights stanwyck robinson but we are somehow sympathetic this not so bright guy who gets played like fiddle by villainous wily woman he lusts after even as he is recording his confession part us understands how he got drawn into murder not just any murder but one money love only there is no money there is no love ms stanwyck is perfectly cast as femme fatale who weaves her web deceit destruction she quickly spots vulnerability macmurrays character uses her assets just enough hold leash tight it is testament her screen presence that she can pull off sultry siren while sporting less than desirable blonde wig at time wig was so controversial that producers compared it george washington wanted it trashed however filming was too far along now its impossible imagine her looking any other way besides macmurray only seems notice her anklet edward g robinson made name himself as tough guy actor cop mobster all rolled into one here he plays insurance investigator with sixth sense fraudulent claims he is hard nosed dedicated employee who takes his responsibility very seriously has no sympathy those who cheat his cherished system he has soft spot co worker macmurray even though he is one back slapping salesmen he so loathes their relationship film is one respect about as close as two professional men could be given era when robinson goes off his rant about suicide research he is joy behold this guy could flat chew scenery addition infamous wig you might also notice that macmurray is wearing wedding band throughout film even though his character is clearly single man wilder macmurray stated many times over years that was simply mistake not caught until post production expect chuckle when macmurray as narrator enviously describes spanish style los angeles home as costing 30 000 probably less than property taxes would be that house today film originally was end with macmurray gas chamber robinson looking inset but this was deemed inappropriate one last little nugget early film macmurray walks out robinsons office past man sitting hallway chair reading paperback book that man raymond chandler his only screen appearance film is often described as quintessential film noir another prime example film noir would be big sleep 1946 based raymond chandler novel directed by howard hawks starring humphrey bogart lauren bacall while film noir might not be easily definable term there are certain elements that must be present lighting is key shadows must be prevalent some type detective story is usually at center we typically get some poor schlub guy being yanked around by femme fatale right mood is essential as viewer we know things are headed down wrong path but we just cant save characters their own poor choices but neither can we look away that helpless feeling is strong indicator that you just watched terrific film noir,0.49999497689371125,0.08601064898533246,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,Anytime You Want A Husband Turned Into Cold Cash,"Billy Wilder's cynical self came to public attention in this classic noir film about a luckless insurance salesman and one coldhearted dame. Double Indemnity skirted the very edges of Code morality and it took years before someone brought James M. Cain's novel to the screen.According to a book on Billy Wilder the casting of Barbara Stanwyck was a must for Phyllis Dietrichson, otherwise the film might never have been made. Barbara Stanwyck was that rarest of players, one who could be good and convincing in all kinds of parts. Look at the films she got her four Oscar nominations besides Double Indemnity, Stella Dallas, Ball of Fire, and Sorry Wrong Number. Not one of those is similar to any one of the others and Stanwyck was acclaimed in all of them.Fortunately for Wilder and for Paramount's budget, their leading man was right on the lot. Fred MacMurray who has been playing comedic foils for folks like Carole Lombard, Claudette Colbert, etc. up to that time, made the most of playing the feckless Walter Neff who gets sucked into a homicidal scheme through passion.Double Indemnity is a landmark film in that it's two leads are really rotten people. Barbara Stanwyck has a husband in Tom Powers she can't stand and would like to bump him off for an insurance settlement and MacMurray's the insurance salesman she beguiles into her plot. Funny thing is that when the mechanics of the murder plot are discussed and formulated, the ideas are all MacMurray's. Billy Wilder made two other films similar to Double Indemnity where a weak protagonist gets caught up in a filthy scheme. In Sunset Boulevard William Holden plays the gigolo way to well and can't break from unto pain of death. And Kirk Douglas's scheme about exploiting the tragedy of a man trapped in a cave brings him down all the way in Ace in the Hole. I'd be hard pressed to say which of the three men was worse.The man who brings them down is Edward G. Robinson, the claims investigator in the insurance office where MacMurray works. Robinson is gradually putting the whole thing together and Wilder is at his best with the scenes of Robinson explaining the progress of his investigation to MacMurray with Fred trying to stay one step ahead.Robinson doesn't usually get enough praise for Double Indemnity. He's got a little man, Hercule Poirot has those little grey cells. Either way both are up to the challenge of solving what looks like a perfect crime. Lot's of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth in James M. Cain's Barton Keyes.Wilder for the one and only time in his career worked with another great mystery writer in Raymond Chandler on the script. It was not a pleasant experience for either. Chandler complained about the working conditions of Hollywood and Wilder complained about Chandler's dissipation. Both were probably right.Among the supporting cast look for a nice performance by Porter Hall who turns out not to be as valuable witness as Robinson originally thought. The man from Medford may not lie, but he's not above a little chiseling.Double Indemnity is one eternal classic it will be studied and dissected by film students for centuries.",anytime you want husband turned into cold cash,billy wilders cynical self came public attention this classic noir film about luckless insurance salesman one coldhearted dame double indemnity skirted very edges code morality it took years before someone brought james m cains novel screen according book billy wilder casting barbara stanwyck was must phyllis dietrichson otherwise film might never have been made barbara stanwyck was that rarest players one who could be good convincing all kinds parts look at films she got her four oscar nominations besides double indemnity stella dallas ball fire sorry wrong number not one those is similar any one others stanwyck was acclaimed all them fortunately wilder paramounts budget their leading man was right lot fred macmurray who has been playing comedic foils folks like carole lombard claudette colbert etc up that time made most playing feckless walter neff who gets sucked into homicidal scheme through passion double indemnity is landmark film that its two leads are really rotten people barbara stanwyck has husband tom powers she cant stand would like bump him off insurance settlement macmurrays insurance salesman she beguiles into her plot funny thing is that when mechanics murder plot are discussed formulated ideas are all macmurrays billy wilder made two other films similar double indemnity where weak protagonist gets caught up filthy scheme sunset boulevard william holden plays gigolo way well cant break unto pain death kirk douglass scheme about exploiting tragedy man trapped cave brings him down all way ace hole id be hard pressed say which three men was worse man who brings them down is edward g robinson claims investigator insurance office where macmurray works robinson is gradually putting whole thing together wilder is at his best with scenes robinson explaining progress his investigation macmurray with fred trying stay one step ahead robinson doesnt usually get enough praise double indemnity hes got little man hercule poirot has those little grey cells either way both are up challenge solving what looks like perfect crime lots agatha christies belgian sleuth james m cains barton keyes wilder one only time his career worked with another great mystery writer raymond chandler script it was not pleasant experience either chandler complained about working conditions hollywood wilder complained about chandlers dissipation both were probably right among supporting cast look nice performance by porter hall who turns out not be as valuable witness as robinson originally thought man medford may not lie but hes not above little chiseling double indemnity is one eternal classic it will be studied dissected by film students centuries,0.46915079365079365,0.026956349206349203,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,An Odd Triangle,"No need to recap the plot or echo consensus points.From the minute he sees her slinking down the stairs in that spangled ankle bracelet, he's hooked. Walter Neff's already boarded that long, lonely trolley down the one-way track. Yes indeed, sultry Phyllis appears to be just the ticket he's been looking for. Great noir classic. All in all, Neff should have paid attention to that other member of the oddball triangle. Old man Keyes may be a born cynic, but despite himself, he's a father figure looking for a son to take his place, and warning Neff about the ""Margie's"" of the world. What he doesn't know is that this ""Margie"" definitely doesn't drink out of a bottle. What's more, Neff's already chosen to ride with the flashy crowd, get out of that dumpy apartment, and get into Phyllis's vicious little insurance swindle. As Keyes tellingly remarks, ""You're not smarter than the rest, Walter, just a little taller."" I like to think that Walter finally realizes his folly in that brilliant final scene, even if it is too late. Still, the film's cynical veneer is misleading. Because beneath all the deceits, betrayals, and ironies, lies a lighted match and one of the odder father-son relationships in Hollywood annals.",odd triangle,no need recap plot or echo consensus points minute he sees her slinking down stairs that spangled ankle bracelet hes hooked walter neffs already boarded that long lonely trolley down one way track yes indeed sultry phyllis appears be just ticket hes been looking great noir classic all all neff should have paid attention that other member oddball triangle old man keyes may be born cynic but despite himself hes father figure looking son take his place warning neff about margies world what he doesnt know is that this margie definitely doesnt drink out bottle whats more neffs already chosen ride with flashy crowd get out that dumpy apartment get into phylliss vicious little insurance swindle as keyes tellingly remarks youre not smarter than rest walter just little taller i like think that walter finally realizes his folly that brilliant final scene even if it is too late still films cynical veneer is misleading because beneath all deceits betrayals ironies lies lighted match one odder father son relationships hollywood annals,0.5759722222222222,-0.05305555555555556,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.42, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,Ten times twice as dangerousÂ…Double Indemnity,"What many call the ultimate film noir, the murder mystery that is spoiled at the start, setting the stage for a retelling by our protagonist of the perfect crime, is unraveled before our eyes. Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity revolves around an insurance fraud murder that appears foolproof until the seams start to tear. Walter Neff, the top salesman two months in a row, falls in love with the young wife of an oilman, a woman looking for a way to leave her troubled marriage. Who better to get away with the perfect crime then a man that sees false claims avenged everyday? Their tracks must be covered and their guilt assuaged. However, being as our first scene shows Walter confessing to everything, we know the well-laid plans were unsuccessful. The trick to the film becomes how it all went down, how the puzzle pieces fell into place, and the power of a conscience, eating away at you until you can't stand the pressure any longer.It is not giving away anything to say that the two complete the task of killing Mr. Dietrichson, a businessman with a temper. The deed is orchestrated to look like he fell off a train, a venue for accidental death that comes with a special double indemnity clause, one that pays twice the cost of his recently purchased insurance of $50,000. That money is the impetus that pushes Neff over the top to help his new mistress. Phyllis Dietrichson is the damsel in distress, the nurse of her husband's first wife that was naÃ¯ve and heartbroken for her boss after his loss. She says it compelled her to stay with him in a union that never held any love. The chance arrival of Neff not only opens her eyes to the possibility of a clean break without any strings and actually some cash to boot, but also to a man she can spend time and possibly settle down with. It is a strange coincidence that the Dietrichson's auto insurance was allowed to lapse, creating a house call, and a happy accident that the man called to visit was one as immoral as Walter. Right from the start he flirts and makes advances towards the woman he knows is married to his client. It's not until the end that you start to consider whether none of it was by chance at all, but instead carefully planned out and manipulated from the first second.Neff is played by Fred MacMurrayÂ—a perfect fit for the role of a shady salesman, unafraid to get his hands dirty. The confidence and swagger allow us to believe he can win over the girl as easily as he does. He is the kind of guy that can fool the world into thinking he is on the level, a man of intelligence and pride. His boss, Barton Keyes and he have a very close relationship, one based on mutual respect and admiration. Neff has them all fooled into believing he is a man of character, one Keyes would personally vouch for, and his initial balk at the offer to help kill Dietrichson shows that maybe he is. Maybe there is some semblance of humanity behind the quick-witted banter and devious smile, a moral compass that won't allow him to cross the line. But greed and lust can tempt even a saint, let alone a guy like Neff, and it doesn't take long for him to begin the blueprints for what will be the perfect crime; one that not even Keyes and his keen lie detector can spot. It is that question of virtue that will ultimately undo him, though, as the strong stomach he thought he had might not be indestructible.The story revolves around MacMurray and as a result he is on screen almost the entire time. He is our narrator and our entrance point into the proceedings. However, it is not a role that we necessarily relate to, nor even begin to feel sorry for to hope he gets away with the crime. Instead, knowing about his confession from the beginning, we sit down to watch his hubris shred his world to pieces. Each person is a cog to the tale at hand; it is the plotting of the film that takes center stage and top billing. The pieces are moved and we follow them through the twists and turns and revelations that change our preconceptions of each. No one is truly as they seem and they all have an ulterior motive just below the surface, propelling their actions and attempts for survival whether the other does or not. Our two criminals are selfish at heart, but until you watch the entire journey, you won't know just how much.While the acting is definitely dated and a product of its time, it doesn't mean that it's not good. Barbara Stanwyck plays MacMurray's partner-in-crime Phyllis with equal panache. She holds her own in every situation, whether with her sharp tongue in some very funny back and forths or in her steely disposition when things get rough, it's a part that needs to be strong and is. Barton Keyes is the role that sticks with you, though. Edward G. Robinson is fantastic as the cocky claims agent, self-proclaimed as never being wrong when his gut says something isn't right.

8.0,Double Indemnity,"Billy Wilder's earlier vintage work, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is an unapologetically thrilling film- noir, without any fluffy fillers, this morally shocking murder tale has justified itself as a textbook exemplar of how cinema is able to be a heavyweight platform to narrate a story, apart from all those auxiliary foils (both visually and sonically), the marrow here is a neat but impeccable script (by Wilder and Raymond Chandler).The impending tragedy has been explicitly unraveled since the very beginning, the storyline starts as a flash-back, our protagonist, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), suffering from a bullet wound in his shoulder, has stated that he neither got the money nor the woman after executed a ruthless murder, then the film jumps to the overture to delve into the details of Walter's fated encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (a gracefully confident Barbara Stanwyck to portray a standard femme-fatale character), as an insurance rep, Walter is smitten with her and assists her to murder her wealthy husband so as to get the so-called ""double indemnity"" insurance compensation. The murder scheme certainly is not the most difficult part, the real challenge is after the evil conduct, in one hand, Walter's super-acute superior Keyes (a bona- fide scene-stealer Edward G. Robinson) who gradually detects the real motive after the presuming accident death; on the other hand, the more devilish past of Phyllis suggests that there is an even bigger conspiracy is under the way.One could never argue that the script is prodigiously witty and most notably is Keyes' eloquence in harnessing his professional intuition (""the little man inside"") to find out the loophole behind any ostensibly qualified insurance cases. It's quite unimaginable that Robinson had been snubbed for a supporting acting nomination while the film has acquired 7, including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR and LEADING ACTRESS (without win though); while MacMurray, had been eluded by the Academy throughout his wholesome career, potentially had delivered his best work in depicting an ambiguous figure with all he had; Stanwyck's role is a tad feeble due to her not-too-copious presence but she is just marvelous to watch with each gesture and expression entangled with her own breed of complexity, but the final convolution of her heartlessness-turns-soft tactic is a self-conscious compromise, woman falls prey of a man's world is just an illusionary chimera, which has been haunting us until this moment and will thrive on and on.",double indemnity,billy wilders earlier vintage work double indemnity is unapologetically thrilling film noir without any fluffy fillers this morally shocking murder tale has justified itself as textbook exemplar how cinema is able be heavyweight platform narrate story apart all those auxiliary foils both visually sonically marrow here is neat but impeccable script by wilder raymond chandler impending tragedy has been explicitly unraveled since very beginning storyline starts as flash back our protagonist walter neff fred macmurray suffering bullet wound his shoulder has stated that he neither got money nor woman after executed ruthless murder then film jumps overture delve into details walters fated encounter with phyllis dietrichson gracefully confident barbara stanwyck portray standard femme fatale character as insurance rep walter is smitten with her assists her murder her wealthy husband so as get so called double indemnity insurance compensation murder scheme certainly is not most difficult part real challenge is after evil conduct one hand walters super acute superior keyes bona fide scene stealer edward g robinson who gradually detects real motive after presuming accident death other hand more devilish past phyllis suggests that there is even bigger conspiracy is under way one could never argue that script is prodigiously witty most notably is keyes eloquence harnessing his professional intuition little man inside find out loophole behind any ostensibly qualified insurance cases its quite unimaginable that robinson had been snubbed supporting acting nomination while film has acquired 7 including best picture director leading actress without win though while macmurray had been eluded by academy throughout his wholesome career potentially had delivered his best work depicting ambiguous figure with all he had stanwycks role is tad feeble due her not too copious presence but she is just marvelous watch with each gesture expression entangled with her own breed complexity but final convolution her heartlessness turns soft tactic is self conscious compromise woman falls prey mans world is just illusionary chimera which has been haunting us until this moment will thrive,0.5473958333333334,0.13637152777777775,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.46}"
,The Match is Out,"Spoilers herein.Filmviewing is like most things in life: there are a few predefined roles among which it is convenient to pick. Once you define who you are in the world of cinema, it determines a lot of what you think about what you have just experienced. One of these roles is the type who by watching a film becomes part of its original audience, or rather a stylized nostalgic notion of what that audience was. Thus the film is a mere trigger, not necessarily important itself. There seem to be lots of these, people who consider this film as not only enjoyable, but the apogee of film noir, which itself is (in this view) the most movie-like of movies. Noir, romances and musicals attract these folks, as do legendary celebrities.You may be one of these types, but I am not. I expect the film to transport me to its own world, not the world of original viewers. As a noir classic, it fails for me. I do think the dictaphone framing is very effective, and the thumblighting of the matches. Also of historical note is the then odd perspective on the detective form: at the beginning you know who did it. You soon learn why. How isn't very interesting. The way the detective gets the scent is purely conventional, but the focus on the hapless perpetrator was relatively novel in its time. The game is one of following this hapless goof through his ensnarement in forces beyond his control. His strong (and we learn misplaced) cockiness, apparent through the aggressive banter is the stylistic spice that is supposed to carry the notion.But that device is pretty thin stuff. And except for the dictaphone bits, the dialog and acting are poor by conventional standards. Stanwyck isn't seductive or particularly deep. I fail to see how the lighting could be considered masterful, when so many other noir masters are around. `Touch of Evil' is excessive, but that's the point with noir -- at least noir that works today.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",match is out,spoilers herein filmviewing is like most things life there are few predefined roles among which it is convenient pick once you define who you are world cinema it determines lot what you think about what you have just experienced one these roles is type who by watching film becomes part its original audience or rather stylized nostalgic notion what that audience was thus film is mere trigger not necessarily important itself there seem be lots these people who consider this film as not only enjoyable but apogee film noir which itself is this view most movie like movies noir romances musicals attract these folks as do legendary celebrities you may be one these types but i am not i expect film transport me its own world not world original viewers as noir classic it fails me i do think dictaphone framing is very effective thumblighting matches also historical note is then odd perspective detective form at beginning you know who did it you soon learn why how isnt very interesting way detective gets scent is purely conventional but focus hapless perpetrator was relatively novel its time game is one following this hapless goof through his ensnarement forces beyond his control his strong we learn misplaced cockiness apparent through aggressive banter is stylistic spice that is supposed carry notion but that device is pretty thin stuff except dictaphone bits dialog acting are poor by conventional standards stanwyck isnt seductive or particularly deep i fail see how lighting could be considered masterful when so many other noir masters are around touch evil is excessive but thats point with noir at least noir that works today teds evaluation 2 4 has some interesting elements,0.5806972789115646,0.044109977324263035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,The First Truly Great Noir,"""The Maltese Falcon"" is generally considered to be the very first film noir, but Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" is the first GREAT noir. With actors that perfectly understood Wilder's penchant for black as tar humour, this film is as seedy, dark and many times funny as they come. Barbara Stanwyck is a knockout as the classic femme fatale, complete with cheap blonde wig and ankle bracelets. Fred MacMurray makes a terrific dope, his silly machimso preventing him from realizing that Stanwyck is one step ahead of him through the entire film. And Edward G. Robinson shines as usual in a small but important role.For me, this film breaks new ground in the hard-boiled/detective/murder mystery genre. I believe it was a bit of a flop when it came out, but that's easy to understand. Films that in retrospect prove themselves to be cutting edge are frequently dismissed at the time of their release. ""Double Indemnity"" doesn't have the look of other studio films of its period, not even other gritty detective films of its period. The lighting is stark and grimy; you can almost see every speck of dust in the shafts of light slanting in through the windows. Wilder gets the feel of a corrupt L.A. just right. But even more than its look, the film is years ahead of its time in its moral tone. Not only do the characters in this film not find redemption, they appear to be unredeemable. Each shows him/herself to be colder and more cynical than the other, and there's a ""Bonnie and Clyde""-like inevitability to their eventual fates.Simply sensational. And watch for the list of ""supposin'""s MacMurray and Stanwyck throw back and forth at each other in one scene. It's hilarious and perfect, and those who've seen the film will know exactly what I'm talking about.Grade: A+",first truly great noir,maltese falcon is generally considered be very first film noir but billy wilders double indemnity is first great noir with actors that perfectly understood wilders penchant black as tar humour this film is as seedy dark many times funny as they come barbara stanwyck is knockout as classic femme fatale complete with cheap blonde wig ankle bracelets fred macmurray makes terrific dope his silly machimso preventing him realizing that stanwyck is one step ahead him through entire film edward g robinson shines as usual small but important role me this film breaks new ground hard boiled detective murder mystery genre i believe it was bit flop when it came out but thats easy understand films that retrospect prove themselves be cutting edge are frequently dismissed at time their release double indemnity doesnt have look other studio films its period not even other gritty detective films its period lighting is stark grimy you can almost see every speck dust shafts light slanting through windows wilder gets feel corrupt l just right but even more than its look film is years ahead its time its moral tone not only do characters this film not find redemption they appear be unredeemable each shows him herself be colder more cynical than other theres bonnie clyde like inevitability their eventual fates simply sensational watch list supposin s macmurray stanwyck throw back forth at each other one scene its hilarious perfect those whove seen film will know exactly what im talking about grade,0.5559984341899237,0.12883853734917564,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10.0,Ultimate film-noir,"Double Indemnity is based on a novel by James Cain adapted to the screen by great novelist Raymond Chandler, who made here his most important contribution to the cinema history in his career, though somehow matched by following screenwriting work for 1946 Howard Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, and Billy Wilder, who previously worked as a screen writer for Ernest Lubitsch and had been already nominated three times for Academy Awards in the process before making Double Indemnity, which nevertheless played the key role in establishing him as one of the best writer-directors in Hollywood, and giving him his fourth Oscar nomination as a writer and his first one as a director.Double Indemnity was the third feature Wilder directed after 1942 The Major and the Minor and 1943 Five Graves to Cairo, but it was definitely the first film, his primary American tragedy where the author for the first time revealed his black and somehow hopelessly pessimistic view of the American society and of the human society in general, blackishly desecrated in the film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters, who independently of being a victim or victimized, of being the protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able to transcend the utterly low and devilish motivations in theirs as a consequence sordidly painful lives and reach such a state where the viewer might get relieved by considering one of them as a positive element. Instead the characters' lives shown in a continuous noir flashback of Fred MacMurray's not-a-confession are driven from the start to the very end by an utter greed in a form of double and not only indemnities with consequential and inherent to it risks and fears in a rather unsure world of insurance.An insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), a man with `no visible scars', starts to lose his already shaky dominance over his mind's yearnings when glimpses on a horizon a possibility of becoming a recipient of a monetary fortune along with no less seductive desire from a part of unhappily married and as devilishly beautiful as resourceful in pursuing her zany in its deadliness schemes, an ultimate femme fatale blond Phyllis (marvellously portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck).Initially apparent as a romantic, the relationship gradually mutates into double confrontation of the two fears of the two characters in their greedy and ambitious pursuits, a conflict which at one point apparently results in a sort of humanization of Phyllis' character, appearing hiding the eyes of her soul behind the sun glasses, a humanization which is let to happen by her only to accentuate later her unchangeably fatal nature.The double confrontation gradually evolves into a triple one when the threatening presence on the scene of no less and probably more resourceful character of Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes more and more evident, as a result of his continuous and obsessive investigation conducted with different but nor less ambitious motives. A motives which find its ultimate revelation in a most touching, but finally most hypocritical scene of declaration of love (I love you - I love you too) between Walter Neff and Barton Keyes in the end, exactly reflecting the same nature of previous interactions between Walter and Phyllis, where such moments with the very words used, such as the supreme word of loving affection - Baby lowered to an unthinkable extent, only were a mere preparation to struck another blow in yet another outburst of hate caused by a new misfortunate complication in carrying out so well devised and apparently perfect plan. Permeated right from the start to the very end with the flavour of unstoppable fatality in an extent that a few other film-noirs achieved, accentuated by the wonderful music score by Miklos Rozsa, Double Indemnity's story is motored by the money like in nearly all of Billy Wilder films. But in this case all the misery produced by it as evident as never before resulting in utter corruption of already corrupted characters and their descent into a such a deep abyss of human misery as probably never before or after in a Hollywood film history, an abyss with no exit, with omnipresent hypocrisy, with no place for sincere human feelings of love, friendship or affection, an abyss to where the characters descent under the monotonous tune of Miklos Rozsa's score, which serves as a reflection of their monotonously hypocrite and ultimately doubly doomed lives. 10/10",ultimate film noir,double indemnity is based novel by james cain adapted screen by great novelist raymond chandler who made here his most important contribution cinema history his career though somehow matched by following screenwriting work 1946 howard hawks classic big sleep billy wilder who previously worked as screen writer ernest lubitsch had been already nominated three times academy awards process before making double indemnity which nevertheless played key role establishing him as one best writer directors hollywood giving him his fourth oscar nomination as writer his first one as director double indemnity was third feature wilder directed after 1942 major minor 1943 five graves cairo but it was definitely first film his primary american tragedy where author first time revealed his black somehow hopelessly pessimistic view american society human society general blackishly desecrated film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters who independently being victim or victimized being protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able transcend utterly low devilish motivations theirs as consequence sordidly painful lives reach such state where viewer might get relieved by considering one them as positive element instead characters lives shown continuous noir flashback fred macmurrays not confession are driven start very end by utter greed form double not only indemnities with consequential inherent it risks fears rather unsure world insurance insurance salesman walter neff fred macmurray man with no visible scars starts lose his already shaky dominance over his minds yearnings when glimpses horizon possibility becoming recipient monetary fortune along with no less seductive desire part unhappily married as devilishly beautiful as resourceful pursuing her zany its deadliness schemes ultimate femme fatale blond phyllis marvellously portrayed by barbara stanwyck initially apparent as romantic relationship gradually mutates into double confrontation two fears two characters their greedy ambitious pursuits conflict which at one point apparently results sort humanization phyllis character appearing hiding eyes her soul behind sun glasses humanization which is let happen by her only accentuate later her unchangeably fatal nature double confrontation gradually evolves into triple one when threatening presence scene no less probably more resourceful character barton keyes edward g robinson becomes more more evident as result his continuous obsessive investigation conducted with different but nor less ambitious motives motives which find its ultimate revelation most touching but finally most hypocritical scene declaration love i love you i love you too between walter neff barton keyes end exactly reflecting same nature previous interactions between walter phyllis where such moments with very words used such as supreme word loving affection baby lowered unthinkable extent only were mere preparation struck another blow yet another outburst hate caused by new misfortunate complication carrying out so well devised apparently perfect plan permeated right start very end with flavour unstoppable fatality extent that few other film noirs achieved accentuated by wonderful music score by miklos rozsa double indemnitys story is motored by money like nearly all billy wilder films but this case all misery produced by it as evident as never before resulting utter corruption already corrupted characters their descent into such deep abyss human misery as probably never before or after hollywood film history abyss with no exit with omnipresent hypocrisy with no place sincere human feelings love friendship or affection abyss where characters descent under monotonous tune miklos rozsas score which serves as reflection their monotonously hypocrite ultimately doubly doomed lives 10 10,0.4518151815181518,0.14219654108267968,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,An all-time Hollywood classic,"This film noir classic may be the best murder mystery of all time in this storied Hollywood genre. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are excellent but it is Barbara Stanwyck who really makes the picture come together as a woman without a moral compass. Stanwyck set the standard for tough, calculating, shady women who exploit men without shame or remorse and her masterful manipulation of MacMurray is the movie's central theme. The film's imagery is filled with shadows and low lighting, accompanied by a tense, brooding music score. Stanwyck spins her web of ensnarement like a black widow with her victim seemingly unaware of the danger that enfolds him. MacMurray provides the narrative of the film which is told in flashback and delivers a cryptic account of the events in a confession to a boss who trusted him completely.

9.0,A Brilliantly Written Classic,"""Double Indemnity"" is a great movie with many great attributes but foremost among these must be its scintillating screenplay which combines wit, intelligence, razor sharp remarks and double entendres in such an effective way that, as well as being immensely entertaining, it also contributes strongly to driving the pace of the story. The quick fire dialogue and superb repartee are so engaging that they command the attention of the audience right from the start and also provide added impetus to all the action that follows. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborated in adapting James M Cain's story for the movie and the end result was nothing short of brilliant and was understandably nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay in 1945.The characters featured in this evil tale are very memorable and in the case of the two main protagonists are also very immoral. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a fast talking insurance salesman who goes to visit a client and in his absence meets his wife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Their first encounter during which Dietrichson appears dressed only in a bath towel, leads to some flirting and their relationship develops further when Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to take part in a scheme to sell her husband an accident policy (unknown to Mr Dietrichson) and then to murder him so that the couple can collect the insurance money and enjoy a future together.Neff advises that the policy will pay out double if the fatal accident occurs on a train and so, when Mr Dietrichson is due to go on a business trip, arrangements are made for him to travel by train. Neff carries out the murder and dressed like Mr Dietrichson (complete with crutches) takes his place on the train journey before the couple place the body on the tracks to give the impression that Mr Dietrichson died as the result of an accidental fall from the observation car of the train.After having carried out their plan successfully, the events that follow conspire to introduce a series of complications which lead to the couple losing their trust in each other and also to the movie's dramatic conclusion.Fred MacMurray is perfect in his role as the very self assured Neff who's corrupted by lust and a greed for wealth. His portrayal of someone who thinks he knows all the angles but whose confidence is gradually eroded as things start to go wrong is very convincing and Barbara Stanwyck is also excellent as the cold, manipulative seductress who is utterly ruthless and seemingly devoid of any human feelings. Edward G Robinson appears in the role of Barton Keyes, a claims investigator who works for the same firm as Neff. Barton is very experienced and incredibly good at his job and possesses a strong instinct which enables him to sense immediately if a claim is likely to be fraudulent. He and Neff enjoy a longstanding friendship which involves a good deal of warmth and mutual respect. Robinson's performance is outstanding as he delivers some super-fast speeches and conveys the nature of his character's idiosyncrasies with great panache.In typical film noir style, the story is told in flashback with Neff's narration providing a particularly matter-of-fact account of what happened. When he says ""I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman"", there's an inherent poignancy in his words but the delivery is completely lacking in any sentimentality or self pity. The same can be said for his remark that ""we did it so that we could be together, but it's tearing us apart"".""Double Indemnity"" is a dark thriller which became the prototype for many later movies which told similar stories but rarely with the same style and impact as the original. Billy Wilder's direction is superb and especially successful in contributing to the high levels of suspense that are generated at various junctures throughout the action. This is a film of rare quality and one that, because of its subject matter, will undoubtedly continue to be a source of great entertainment and fascination for movie lovers for many years to come.",brilliantly written classic,double indemnity is great movie with many great attributes but foremost among these must be its scintillating screenplay which combines wit intelligence razor sharp remarks double entendres such effective way that as well as being immensely entertaining it also contributes strongly driving pace story quick fire dialogue superb repartee are so engaging that they command attention audience right start also provide added impetus all action that follows billy wilder raymond chandler collaborated adapting james m cains story movie end result was nothing short brilliant was understandably nominated academy award best writing screenplay 1945 characters featured this evil tale are very memorable case two main protagonists are also very immoral walter neff fred macmurray is fast talking insurance salesman who goes visit client his absence meets his wife phyllis dietrichson barbara stanwyck their first encounter during which dietrichson appears dressed only bath towel leads some flirting their relationship develops further when dietrichson eventually convinces neff take part scheme sell her husband accident policy unknown mr dietrichson then murder him so that couple can collect insurance money enjoy future together neff advises that policy will pay out double if fatal accident occurs train so when mr dietrichson is due go business trip arrangements are made him travel by train neff carries out murder dressed like mr dietrichson complete with crutches takes his place train journey before couple place body tracks give impression that mr dietrichson died as result accidental fall observation car train after having carried out their plan successfully events that follow conspire introduce series complications which lead couple losing their trust each other also movies dramatic conclusion fred macmurray is perfect his role as very self assured neff whos corrupted by lust greed wealth his portrayal someone who thinks he knows all angles but whose confidence is gradually eroded as things start go wrong is very convincing barbara stanwyck is also excellent as cold manipulative seductress who is utterly ruthless seemingly devoid any human feelings edward g robinson appears role barton keyes claims investigator who works same firm as neff barton is very experienced incredibly good at his job possesses strong instinct which enables him sense immediately if claim is likely be fraudulent he neff enjoy longstanding friendship which involves good deal warmth mutual respect robinsons performance is outstanding as he delivers some super fast speeches conveys nature his characters idiosyncrasies with great panache typical film noir style story is told flashback with neffs narration providing particularly matter fact account what happened when he says i killed him money woman i didnt get money i didnt get woman theres inherent poignancy his words but delivery is completely lacking any sentimentality or self pity same can be said his remark that we did it so that we could be together but its tearing us apart double indemnity is dark thriller which became prototype many later movies which told similar stories but rarely with same style impact as original billy wilders direction is superb especially successful contributing high levels suspense that are generated at various junctures throughout action this is film rare quality one that because its subject matter will undoubtedly continue be source great entertainment fascination movie lovers many years come,0.5449274099883856,0.23841318234610923,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.45}"
