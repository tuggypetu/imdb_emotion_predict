1.0,Incomprehensible,"About halfway through the movie, I was actually considering giving this a 4, but the complete and utter lack of reasoning in this movie that made me give it a 1 I will now try to sum up.The ghost made a website that people can log (and start hallucinating from) onto only 48 hours later they will be dead unless they find her body so she can exact revenge on someone who killed her on another website that people subscribe to, even though she kills other people in car crashes and train accidents who had no involvement with her death.Things I learned from FearDotCom:-Ghosts are capable of creating websites.-The internet is inherently evil.-People who use the internet are freaks.-People who use the internet are incapable of closing their eyes.-A bunch of weird images on a computer can drive someone crazy and make them hallucinate.-A bunch of weird images on a movie can drive someone so crazy that they hallucinate so they think what they are watching makes one ounce of logical sense.Obviously the producers of this movie wanted the audience to be driven insane by the film and have shut off our brains by the time the ""ending"" has arrived.

2.0,It's a mess.,"I was interested to see if time had been kind to this film, or if the original loathing I felt during the release still held. Well the answer, it's worse then I remember, time has of course been unkind, so it now looks dated, but worse, it's an incoherent mess, that makes absolutely no sense. I will give some credit to Natasha McElhone, who does at least try and give a sincere performance, but she was up against it in this dire film.At the time the production values were pretty good, so I won't slate it for ageing, but I will slam it for being a terrible film, that makes no sense at all, it never decides whether it wants to be a thriller or a supernatural horror.Avoid. 2/10",its mess,i was interested see if time had been kind this film or if original loathing i felt during release still held well answer its worse then i remember time has course been unkind so it now looks dated but worse its incoherent mess that makes absolutely no sense i will give some credit natasha mcelhone who does at least try give sincere performance but she was up against it this dire film at time production values were pretty good so i wont slate it ageing but i will slam it being terrible film that makes no sense at all it never decides whether it wants be thriller or supernatural horror avoid 2 10,0.5583333333333333,0.018229166666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.05, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,Worst Movie Ever,"I would estimate that I've seen over a thousand movies in my lifetime. FeardotCom may very well be the worst of those films. The acting is bad, the dialogue is worse, and the editing is terrible. The film lacks coherence, cohesiveness, and, in some parts, comprehensiveness. The film manages to maintain its unwatchability for over an hour, but by that point the viewer will probably have already logged onto www.feardotcom.com in hopes of ending the misery. If I had been able to give this movie less than a star, I would have done so in a heartbeat.

2.0,No wonder people claim the horror genre is dead,"If the survival of horror films depends on titles such as this ""FearDotCom"", we are indeed facing the downfall of the genre. This is lame, uninspired and repetitive garbage that irritates you from start to finish. Director William Malone's idea of suspense exists out of underexposed and fuzzy images of murders edited together in boisterous flashes that actually show you NOTHING. Add a poorly written script about a murderous website and completely unconvincing characters to this and you've got yourself one of the biggest cinema-turkeys since the new millennium. If the premise of this film rings a bell, it means that you recognize it from the Japanese cult hit ""Ringu"". Or the slightly inferior American remake ""the Ring"". Only, the videotape has been replaced by an internet website and the poor victims have only 2 days left to live after being exposed instead of 7. Typical for an unscrupulous rip-offFaster, louder and modernized! The elaboration is a mess: weak dialogue, plot holes all over the place, no style or atmosphere and very bad acting. I can't believe class actors like Udo Kier and Stephen Rea were talked into accepting roles like this? Surely they can still do better even though they both have seen their best times. Stephen Dorff and the leading lady deliver lousy performances in roles that really don't fit them. Dorff as a tough, experienced copper? Doubtful Perhaps what annoyed me most about the cast (shallow, I admit) is seeing how one of my all-time favorite B-actors, Jeffrey Combs, is given such a small and insignificant role! That's Doctor Herbert West from Re-Animator we're talking about, dammit! Show a little more respect, Malone! If you love horror, you should avoid ""FearDotCom"" at all costs!

6.0,The 'Ringu' of Internet  A Ghost Story,"After some mysterious deaths showing the same symptoms in the victims, Terry Huston (Natascha McElhone), from the Department of Health, investigates the possibility of a virus in the city with Homicide Detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff). However, they realize that all the victims have visited an Internet site called 'www.fear.com' forty-eight hours before dying. A further investigation shows that there is a ghost on the web killing its users. Meanwhile, Detective Mike Reilly is also investigating a murderer called Alistair Pratt, 'The Doctor' (Stephen Rea). This movie has good and bad points. The story is plagiarized from the excellent and original Japanese 'Ringu', but the American 'The Ring' was a copy and became a success. There are some flaws along the confused plot. But there are also interesting points. For example, the dark and rainy atmosphere recalls 'Seven'. There is a sort of contrast between the modern (computer, Internet, cars) and life in the 30's or 40's (old buildings, classic costumes and furniture), recalling a film-noir, with a beautiful photography and style. There are also some reasonable special effects. The cast is slightly above average, with Natascha McElhone, Stephen Rea and Stephen Dorff. Therefore I dare to say that it is a watchable movie and I do not agree with the User Rating. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'MedoPontoCombr' ('FearDotCom')",ringu internet ghost story,after some mysterious deaths showing same symptoms victims terry huston natascha mcelhone department health investigates possibility virus city with homicide detective mike reilly stephen dorff however they realize that all victims have visited internet site called www fear com forty eight hours before dying further investigation shows that there is ghost web killing its users meanwhile detective mike reilly is also investigating murderer called alistair pratt doctor stephen rea this movie has good bad points story is plagiarized excellent original japanese ringu but american ring was copy became success there are some flaws along confused plot but there are also interesting points example dark rainy atmosphere recalls seven there is sort contrast between modern computer internet cars life 30s or 40s old buildings classic costumes furniture recalling film noir with beautiful photography style there are also some reasonable special effects cast is slightly above average with natascha mcelhone stephen rea stephen dorff therefore i dare say that it is watchable movie i do not agree with user rating my vote is six title brazil medopontocombr feardotcom,0.4561791383219955,0.1594671201814059,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.4}"
1.0,I'd rather watch Anti-Smoking Commercials,"I'd rather watch Anti-Smoking Commercials than this because at least you'd see real horror. I saw this film when it was fresh in theaters. Hearing no negative feedback (or any for that matter) I thought it looked interesting so I went to see it. Considering I was one of about 4 people in the whole theater I jumped to the conclusion that this movie was bad, and was it. The whole movie is very dark in scenery and in acting.The movie is about a website (feardotcom.com) that if you go there some dead chick asks you if you want to play a game, and then eventually kills you. Behind the website is a snuff film maker that shows footage of him killing people 'erotically.' The director of this movie must has some screws loose in his head. It's like a cheap cheesy very poorly done 8mm ripoff.I'm all for movies in the 'Bottom 100' of IMDB. I enjoy movies that the critics hate.

1.0,Watching this is honestly similar to being brutally bludgeoned with a hard object,"I do not really remember how I came upon this movie, but I do know that somewhere along the way it has made it's way into my DVD collection. I do not know if I blindly bought it, was given it as a ""gift"", or if someone lent it to me and I just forgot to return it, but whatever way, it is in there now. I watched it quite some time ago, expecting it to be decent enough, entertaining at least, because I really liked the tagline and the premise seemed fun, though I have learned to stay away from a lot of ""technology killing"" horrors over the past few years now, and I remembered before I watched it again recently that I hated it the first time I watched it, a lot, and it was very negatively reviewed as well. Watching it again confirmed my feelings.The film itself is just entirely ridiculous and absurd from beginning to end with a horrible storyline and lame performances and ""thrills"". There is zero to none interesting scenes that make the viewer feel creeped out or enticed in any way, and the whole film is a joke within itself. I especially hated the ludicrous characters and twists, and also the way the story was executed in a poor manner, not being able to stay with one main idea for too long that it is infuriatingly annoying to watch the plot, what plot there is at least, unfold. The movie resembles a little diddy of a film titled ""Ringu/The Ring"" an awful lot, though both of those renditions are spectacular and this pales entirely in comparison, and even though there are some nice settings in this movie, that is really and truly the only plus side to it.There are many noticeable errors and plot holes, the dialogue is, for our inconvenience, not as laughable as one would hope, but corny enough to get a few giggles now and then, especially some of the deliverances from the female lead, and the climax/ending is not anywhere near heartracing or interest sparking, just bland and hardly tolerable. There are many useless scenes of violence that have no importance whatsoever except to try and get a rise in the viewer, which was not accomplished in my situation, and a lot of material is just thrown in there randomly, which goes back to how I stated it is poorly executed and extremely mediocre.

1.0,At least the poster was cool looking,"My, my, my, what a sick and twisted world we live in for a film such as this to be made. After watching this film, I had to take a shower to wipe off the detritus that was emanating from the screen. What has Stephen Dorff done to his once promising career. This isn't a bad career move, this is jumping off a cliff. Was he angry because he didn't get a part for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 6 or Ghoulies 7?

3.0,Terrible,"Not far in the movie I realized I was watching a terrible version of 'Ringu', the Japanese movie that inspired a very good US movie named 'The Ring'. It has the same elements. A medium that kills because you watch it (in 'The Ring' a videotape, here an internet-site), a little girl that is probably the key to solve the problem, a woman and a guy searching for the answer, both saw the site and therefor they both have to hurry, and why they have to hurry has something to do with earlier events. Here they have 48 hours to solve this mystery that involves The Doctor, a killer who broadcasts live killings over the internet. Well, not just killings. He tortures a woman for a long time and in the end there must be a point where the woman asks him to be killed. And so it is done.To tell more about the messy plot would be stupid. I am not even sure if I understand everything. After you have seen the internet-site you die of your worst fear in 48 hours, that I did understand, but why do 'infected' people see the little girl over and over again while she herself was killed as an adult? I probably missed it but like I said it doesn't really matter. The scary visuals have something admirable. The images are really haunting but again I liked the videotape from 'The Ring' a lot more. May be you will like it for the images and some scary moments, but I think you can find a better movie.

1.0,FearNotCom,"'Feardotcom' was filmed in Luxembourg (apparently standing in for New York, I think.) and hasn't been officially released yet. I saw it as one of the featured films during the Luxembourg International Film festival. (Cinenygma) - One of the executive producers, who introduced the film, said it wasn't 100% finished yet, and that even the title might change. However, since every second of the film was even more tortuous than the depravities depicted on the screen, I believe no amount of focus groups or editing could save this film. I'd say 'straight to video', but that would be a major waste of plastic and cardboard. I suppose if they market it as a parody, they might salvage the cost of, um, the catering during the film.Stephen Dorff plays a hard-boiled detective who's haunted by that one case that was never solved. You know he's haunted because he walks around with a 3 day growth of beard. Which stays at the same length the whole film, even though the film covers quite a few days (it was hard tell, nothing was very coherent) And guess what! His old nemesis from the unsolved case is killing again! Oh boy! And since we now have new cases to solve, AND they're dying from what looks to be a virus, we need to bring in the woman scientist and nominal love interest (Natascha McElhone - who displayed quite amply in 'The Truman Show' that she can't act. She must work cheap, or maybe they needed someone to make Dorff look good.) We know she's a scientist because she wears glasses. And just for grins we get Jeffrey Coombs as Dorff's partner, whose main role appears to be running around spouting non-sequiturs. Speaking of which, there was a writer listed for the film but I'd bet a Ben Franklin that they were making up the dialog as they went along, and probably for a different film. It's too bad 'Deep Space 9' went off the air - it might have prevented Coombs from getting caught up in this travesty. And there's Stephen Rea as the mad scientist, looking vaguely like Geoffrey Rush mad scientist character in 'Mystery Men.' Now, I could have sworn Rea could act, so maybe they are two of them? Amazingly a director is also listed, but from what I can tell they pretty much turned on the camera, came back later, took the film to the editing room, forgot to turn on the lights and just started editing. That would explain a lot.And what of the plot? Ha! There isn't one! Well, OK, maybe a little one. I think the deal was that the girl killed in the unsolved case somehow inhabited the internet and is killing people if they log on to the mad scientist's site, where HE tortures women until they beg him to kill them - and all for $9.95! (but just for grins they (the unfortunates who log into fear.com) only die after 48 hours, because, I think, that's how long it took her to be killed) But I think you'd need a broadband connection, because somehow when you login, this girl living in the internet puts a hex on you, which involves you falling off your chair and eventually trashing your apartment and nose bleeds, and um, dying from the fright of your worst fear (like being cast in this movie) and I really don't think that could happen with a dial up connection. Um, anyway, she's going to keep on killing people unless the mad scientist is caught. And her body is found too. I mean they threw that bit in there about finding the body, but then when it was found, it didn't count for anything! Now, doesn't that just bite. Damn fickle internet ghosts.**SPOILER**Actually this whole film was a spoiler, at least it smelled spoiled to me. Anyway - the final scene where Dorff and the McElhone rush into the mad scientist's lair (located in an abandoned steel mill or nuclear plant - the film couldn't make up it's mind what it was - it identified it as both during different scenes in the film) and stop him only seconds before he's going to kill his latest victim had me rolling in the aisle with laughter. It was just like watching an old horror film from the 30's or 40's. Maniacal laughter, bug-eyed expressions of madness, flashing lights, tilted camera angles. So they manage to save the girl, but then the mad scientist shoots Dorff, and then stabs McElhone then Dorff grabs a keyboard and logs into feardot.com which drives the mad scientist so mad - he dies from fear! Then Dorff dies, and McElhone, who was in love with Dorff (oh, did I leave that part out? - apparently they fell madly in love in some 30 second scene earlier in the film - some real in-depth character development going on here.) sort of cries over his body, but um, somehow she's no longer stabbed! Maybe it was her Multi-vitamin.**END OF SPOILER**So -um, in conclusion - I can't imagine any changes to this film possibly making it watchable.

7.0,"Stylish, grisly and entertaining b-movie","Feardotcom might not be a masterpiece by any means with its weird supernatural plot, at times cheap special effects and wooden actors and actresses but it certainly doesn't deserve the loath and ridicule it has received upon release. The story revolves around a dynamic police officer and a clever researcher who investigate a series of strange deaths that have occured after the victims visited a website depicting voyeuristic torture murder. It turns out that the website is haunted by one of its victims who is seeking for vengeance. The police officer and the researcher attempt to find out more about the victim's case to stop the haunting and arrest the serial killer behind the website to put an end to the violence.The movie's main flaw is that its generous budget of forty million dollars hasn't been used very efficiently. The special effects are average at best, the actors and actresses are at times misplaced and the director failed to make a dynamic, fluid and emotional movie out of the script. It isn't hard to understand why this film became a box office bomb.However, the movie isn't without its merits. The atmosphere is gloomy from start to finish. The dirty locations blend in perfectly. The lighting techniques and sound effects are employed with care. The idea to show the dark side of the internet back in the early years of the millennium wasn't completely new as it had been portrayed in Pulse, Ringu and Videodrome before but said intention was nevertheless already ahead of its time.In the end, you will enjoy Feardotcom if you are looking for a very atmospheric supernatural thriller with some grisly violence. The movie is stylish, gruesome and entertaining. If you are however looking for high-quality special effects, a clever plot and gifted acting performances, then this movie and genre simply aren't your cup of tea.",stylish grisly entertaining b movie,feardotcom might not be masterpiece by any means with its weird supernatural plot at times cheap special effects wooden actors actresses but it certainly doesnt deserve loath ridicule it has received upon release story revolves around dynamic police officer clever researcher who investigate series strange deaths that have occured after victims visited website depicting voyeuristic torture murder it turns out that website is haunted by one its victims who is seeking vengeance police officer researcher attempt find out more about victims case stop haunting arrest serial killer behind website put end violence movies main flaw is that its generous budget forty million dollars hasnt been used very efficiently special effects are average at best actors actresses are at times misplaced director failed make dynamic fluid emotional movie out script it isnt hard understand why this film became box office bomb however movie isnt without its merits atmosphere is gloomy start finish dirty locations blend perfectly lighting techniques sound effects are employed with care idea show dark side internet back early years millennium wasnt completely new as it had been portrayed pulse ringu videodrome before but said intention was nevertheless already ahead its time end you will enjoy feardotcom if you are looking very atmospheric supernatural thriller with some grisly violence movie is stylish gruesome entertaining if you are however looking high quality special effects clever plot gifted acting performances then this movie genre simply arent your cup tea,0.4942212711530894,0.11417601338055884,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,Nonsensical rubbish given glossy finish,"Investigating a spate of similar deaths that may be virus related, officer Mike Reilly and Department of Health's Terry Huston are left stumped by the connections in the similar deaths. However as the deaths continue, some video taped clues surface and guide them. They uncover a website that may be related to the deaths and also reminds Reilly of the cruel doctor Alistair Pratt. What CAN it all mean?In an attempt to be fair to this film, I was in the gym when I watched this film and was jogging for the majority of the time. Maybe that means I wasn't concentrating and thus missed the good side of it, or I was too focused on it (to avoid the pain) and became nick-picky. Either way I'm sure my opinion of this film would be the same in either situation.  that this film is polished nonsense.The plot is so lacking a central focus point, a driver if you will, that at times it is as disjointed as some of the butchered bodies on display. Those strands that do exist are very loose and don't really hang convincingly well together. The end result is that there is no real tension to speak of  certainly no fear. While I did think that the main idea of the website was good, it went nowhere of merit.What was left was simply a lot of flashy MTV camera shots and cinematography to try and give the impression of weirdness or an impressive film. If the substance had been there in support these might have been more impressive, as it is they only serve to highlight how utterly hollow they are.The cast are all pretty average. I only watched it because I saw Dorff's name in the credits but he did nothing to really speak of. Likewise McElhone easily slips into scream queen mode.  Rea's evil doctor was OK but not expanded on at all or used well at any point. The support cast of victims all run round scared (or bleeding) as required  no more no less.Overall I was disappointed wit the film. It had an interesting, if not great concept to work from, but failed to build any sort of substance and comes off just looking like a long music video with gore.",nonsensical rubbish given glossy finish,investigating spate similar deaths that may be virus related officer mike reilly department healths terry huston are left stumped by connections similar deaths however as deaths continue some video taped clues surface guide them they uncover website that may be related deaths also reminds reilly cruel doctor alistair pratt what can it all mean attempt be fair this film i was gym when i watched this film was jogging majority time maybe that means i wasnt concentrating thus missed good side it or i was too focused it avoid pain became nick picky either way im sure my opinion this film would be same either situation that this film is polished nonsense plot is so lacking central focus point driver if you will that at times it is as disjointed as some butchered bodies display those strands that do exist are very loose dont really hang convincingly well together end result is that there is no real tension speak certainly no fear while i did think that main idea website was good it went nowhere merit what was left was simply lot flashy mtv camera shots cinematography try give impression weirdness or impressive film if substance had been there support these might have been more impressive as it is they only serve highlight how utterly hollow they are cast are all pretty average i only watched it because i saw dorffs name credits but he did nothing really speak likewise mcelhone easily slips into scream queen mode reas evil doctor was ok but not expanded at all or used well at any point support cast victims all run round scared or bleeding as required no more no less overall i was disappointed wit film it had interesting if not great concept work but failed build any sort substance comes off just looking like long music video with gore,0.5212393872277592,0.056132336655592474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.47}"

I really don't know, how could I force myself not to turn this movie off after the first 20 minutes or so. In the first 1-2 minutes, I was hopeful, i thought, that it can't be a bad movie, because it has Udo Kier in it! My god, how wrong I was...When the movie reached the 20 minutes mark, I was so desperate, that I've never been in my life. By then, it was pretty obvious, that this is a bad movie. It wasn't like that, when a movie seems good at the start but goes downhill later; no. It was bad from the beginning to the end.There is no story. There is no acting. There is no direction.

Of course the answer is YES. Then you get to see a wacko torture people live on the website. Which begs the first question: Is a ghost running his website? How does he pay her?Basically the problem with this movie is it tries to develop a mystery about things we don't care about. So the cops are on the case after people show up dying around the city. Turns out they all visited this website and died soon after. So, of course, the brain surgeon cops log on as well. Now they're in trouble. Weird things happen to them and a little ghost girl with a bouncing ball show up. Follow the bouncing ball stupid!So it all ends up with this girl and the wacko on the website being connected somehow. The ghost in the machine is guiding people to the doctor. If you can't unravel the mystery, she'll kill you for not trying.It kind of choked on its own plot. It was too much. I would have been happy with just the ghost.

What I didn't expect was for it to be so bad.1. What was up with the lighting? Did they spend the entire budget on the website graphics and not have enough left over for electricity?2. How many times can one movie reuse special effects from House On Haunted Hill? The ""ghosts"" walking around and having a seizure?

The even ripped off the gory statues that could be found in the foyer to the basement in HOHH.3. How did the main characters fall in love after meeting for two seconds? They had very little chemistry together. Which is probably due to the fact that Natascha McElhone CAN'T ACT!4.

3.0,It's a Mess Alright,"If You don't look at the ratings, ""Feardotcom"" looks and sounds like an interesting piece of modern horror set in the modern world, especially intriguing because it's 2002, when the internet was not yet the powerful force it is now. But, of course, give benefits to the voice of the people, because this is one hot mess, flawed on every level.A New York City detective investigates mysterious deaths occurring 48 hours after users log onto a site named feardotcom. 'Nough said. Story-wise, ""Feardotcom"" reminded me of J-horror, finer examples like ""Ringu"", ""Ju-On"", ""Pulse"", etc., all starts with mysterious deaths, all seems dark and grimy, mystery needs to be find out, and there is almost always a scary (little) girl involved. ""Feardotcom"" has all of that, but to no success. A familiar plot is continuously sabotaged by a gloom-doom-overkill cinematography and darkly messy visual depiction of New York City, silly, often highly expositional, point-out-the-obvious dialogues, sub-par acting, eyebrow-raising and overcooked action sequences with odd editing solutions, and so and so forth. Worst of all, the film takes itself dead seriously, and possesses little to no wit, so the product turned rather preposterous. Stephen Dorff grunts his way through, Natascha McElhone delivers a funky performance & Stephen Rea is maybe a little creepily amusing as the over-the-top torturer. Whatever potential ""Feardotcom"" had, was buried early on. It does look better than it feels, it is an expensive movie afterall (40 million, what?!).If you feel like You might watch this, be sure to gather some friends, grab a few beers or hit a doob, because it will be a bumpy ride.

,***1/2 out of 5,"Every so often a film will come along that requires a fair deal of sacrifice. You have to sacrifice your personal code of what you come to call of perfection and you must view the world through your eyes and not your mind. Feardotcom is one of those films. In a grey world, with a blue atmosphere and a black existence, lies a man, bleeding from the eyes from some sort of hemerage, dead, because of his plagued visions of a little blonde girl with a white ball. The case is brought forward to a detective who fears germs and disease and one who works with them at the Department of Health. As they search for the answers of why so many people are being found dead, bleeding from the eyes they stumble upon a website entitled feardotcom.com. As more research is made available they are able to link the death of the victim to occurring exactly forty-eight hours after logging on to the site. Then comes the obligatory promise to not visit that site at any cost but instantly break it as soon as the others back is turned. There are three functioning parties within the parameters of this film. There are the good guys. The bad guy, a medical reject that is known only as The Doctor. This is a man who believes that death is an art and therefore should be as graphic as possible. He tortures his victims until they beg to die and then he kills them, making him an artist instead of a murderer. The last formation in this morbid puzzle is a blonde dominatrix, a pale little girl with a white ball and a rotting corpse at the bottom of a flooded reservoir. She is a neutron force that keeps the cell process moving in a forward fashion. She is neither good nor evil. She kills but does so in hopes of redemption. A person searching for something but hasn't found the right key to unlock her treasure chest of ghastly bliss. The problem here is that neither the Doctor nor does the ghost have any connecting factors. First the cops search for the Doctor, then they becomes side tracked by the site that is killing people and search for the ghost and forget about the Doctor, until they finally set the ghost aside and go back to searching for the doctor. This film is an incoherent mess that possesses no bonding materials to make its story move at one pace and stick to one thing at a time. It is like a huge black whole where things come out of and get sucked back in as they feel. Scenes end short with no others to vouch for them. People are found dead and forgotten about and detectives find things without having to search for them, only to have nothing in which to apply them to in the future. But we must take into consideration that this is one of the best boring films I have ever seen. It's a film that makes promises to its viewer and then breaks them because it can. It is more of an experience than a film itself. It is a group of scenes that would make David Lynch bow his head in honours but would never be dumb enough to form a movie around. It is a cyber kinetic game that plays with its viewer's emotions. Why do you look at car crashes even though you know you don't want to see what could have happened to the victim? It is because people want to see something that they shouldn't. It's a voyeuristic tendency that people have that could push oneself to the edge of decency and still leave the person hungry for more. This is a film that wants to feed our fetishes with the obscene by being as sick and twisted as possible. We are shown skinned human carcasses, blood spewing reptile like women and live surgery, all broadcast on the Internet. The human body is a network of gears and leavers that read codes that enable life, so why can't computers do the same thing? The Internet is a body of work that previews the future by utilizing the past. Yet this is not a smart film, it ditches the idea of having something to say within the first half an hour. It has no moral code and follows no ingenious rules, it goes wherever it wants, whenever it wants and has no problem in knowing that it is absolutely terrible. You could probably get the same effect of this film from lining up four televisions in a row and playing Seven, Dee Snider's Strangeland, the Cell and House on Haunted Hill all at once. It is one huge mash of colours and feeling that the eyes will love but the brain will loathe. The film was directed by William Malone who knows how to make terrible horror films (House on Haunted Hill) that are like nice, big, juicy, red apples. They look delicious until you bite into it and get a mouthful of a nice plump worm. This is one of the most visually stunning films of the year and one of the most inconsistent all at the same time. This is a film that has so much going for it that that its priorities get lost in the cause and become little of the effect. But although this is a truly brilliant film, it is nothing more than a W.Y.S.I.W.Y.G. (what your see is what you get). It suffers in trying to compare but results in little contrast. The visuals have really nothing to do with anything that happens in this film. It's not some deep, emotional burden that uses symbolic structures and astounding breakdowns to amplify the viewer's attention span and make them think. This is a run-of-the-mill detective thriller with a ghost story twist. It has no symbolic substance meaning that if you really wish to see how miraculous this film is you have to watch this film in such a fashion that you will be able to absorb the films good qualities, on mute. William Malone, a man whose fascination with fear allows him to produce the product but rarely radiate it, directed the film. I think it would suit Malone wonderfully to consider becoming a conceptual artist of take up the art of silence film. The film also sees Malone in one of the years most ironic pairing in actor Stephen Dorff (neither seems to read scripts before signing on to films). Dorff is the films greatest asset in that he is the most talented man on screen and he does the best he can to make this film seem like a real detective film. As for Stephen Rea as the Doctor, he falls flat on his face. Rea is one of the most boring and unthreatening villains I have ever seen, clearly this guy called in a favour to get this role. Since this film was released I have seen nothing but negative comments for it, which, in all entirety, it deserves. But in all honesty there is more good about this film than people are willing to realize because they are bogged down by the incepted story and not willing to care about anything else. But for the most part, in the genre of bad films, this one is just about the best.",1 2 out 5,every so often film will come along that requires fair deal sacrifice you have sacrifice your personal

killing people search ghost forget about doctor until they finally set ghost aside go back searching doctor this film is incoherent mess that possesses no bonding materials make its story move at one pace stick one thing at time it is like huge black whole where things come out get sucked back as they feel scenes end short with no others vouch them people are found dead forgotten about detectives find things without having search them only have nothing which apply them future but we must take into consideration that this is one best boring films i have ever seen its film that makes promises

1.0,Wow. . I could have watched paint dry instead!,"I've seen my fair share of bad movies. But I can honestly say that this is in my top 3 worst movies. Usually, when I see an extremely bad film, it's so awful that it's funny - which makes it somewhat entertaining. But this film went into another and far worse category. A film so awful that I got a headache - not because the plot was so complex and intelligent, but because the plot was so ridiculous and unrealistic. It's simple: when you go in search of a killer, call for backup. Don't go alone into an empty building. Have some common sense! Unfortunatelt, all the characters in FeardotCom, seem to have been born without the common sense gene. I could suffer through dozens of cheesy horror flicks where the victim getting chased by a killer conveniently trips and falls down while the killer get increasingly closer. . . I could even suffer through poor acting in a horror flick if the plot is entertaining and at least scary. But, when the plot of a film is neither logical nor entertaining you get one movie: FeardotCom",wow i could have watched paint dry instead,ive seen my fair share bad movies but i can honestly say that this is my top 3 worst movies usually when i see extremely bad film its so awful that its funny which makes it somewhat entertaining but this film went into another far worse category film so awful that i got headache not because plot was so complex intelligent but because plot was so ridiculous unrealistic its simple when you go search killer call backup dont go alone into empty building have some common sense unfortunatelt all characters feardotcom seem have been born without common sense gene i could suffer through dozens cheesy horror flicks where victim getting chased by killer conveniently trips falls down while killer get increasingly closer i could even suffer through poor acting horror flick if plot is entertaining at least scary but when plot film is neither logical nor entertaining you get one movie feardotcom,0.6645262145262144,-0.12365319865319863,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.37}"
5.0,Do you like to watch? Death via computer!,"This piece of gore is better than the bad rap it has been given. Some scenes could be deemed repulsive. Not advised for weak stomachs. A NYPD detective(Stephen Dorff)gets the case of his life when mysterious deaths are linked to a website where a demented doctor(Stephen Rea)tortures victims to death. Forty-eight hours after logging on to the live website the viewer dies by their own worse fear. Curiosity overrides common sense. Fear can be compelling.
