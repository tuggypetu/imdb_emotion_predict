10.0,awesome movie...one of a kind!,"My uncle gave up watching Hindi movies as he believed that there was no good Hindi movie after 'Anand'. He started watching bollywood movies again after watching 'Black'. Black is Hindi cinema at it's best. Obviously, Amitabh Bachchan plays the lead in it...who else can? While watching this movie, I laughed, I cried and I enjoyed myself. Amitabh Bachchan trying to show 'bullshit'in sign language and Rani Mukherjee trying to hit the person who bumped into her. Amitabh Bachchan, is inspiring. There's nothing to say about him...as he left me speechless. Rai Mukherjee's performance is by far her best.

8.0,I changed my views about Hindi movies too...,"For a long time I would watch Hindi / Tamil movies only when ironing. You don't care if you miss some parts - there is always gratuitous mandatory dances, fights and incidental humor.Black stands out among the Hindi movies. The brilliant acting, dramatic tension, breathtaking views of the mansions in Simla and the story-telling technique blended to create a great experience. Agreed Amitab is a great actor. But Rani Mukerjee mounts a respectable challenge to him. Supporting actors were great too.If Hindi movies are half as good as this, I would watch more.I had a bonanza holiday break watching Black, Paheli and Mangal Pande. Looks like there is some real light at the end of the tunnel, after all!

8.0,Pretentious yet impressive; manipulative yet moving,"Sanjay Leeela Bhansali's Black is definitely a good film. It is brilliantly scripted, made and executed, and it is also profound and complex. Many have called it a pretentious show, and indeed, that's something very obvious and annoying. I'm sure Bhansali from the very outset had planned to get many awards, five-star reviews, and ""the-best-filmmaker-in-the-country"" titles, but that said, nobody can completely begrudge him since this movie is as impressive and well-invested as it is ostentatious, and it deserves the hype. Let's start with saying that technically and visually Black is a treat. It boasts of fantastic sets and wonderful costumes, and the cinematography is incredibly good. All these, along with the superb background score, create a beautifully dark film. Having said that, this may be the exact reason why many viewers found it hard to relate to, and that's something I can easily understand, particularly after having seen his best feature to date, Khamoshi: The Musical, in which everything was kept simple. Here there's no simplicity: everything is lavish, big, grandiose - and that's why it's often labelled pretentious. The film is emotional yet unsentimental, which is good, but then, one of its main flaws is the fact that more than once it resorts to emotional manipulation, trying to forcibly wring tears.Well, one thing is sure and it is that you can always expect good acting in a SLB film, particularly when it has an Amitabh Bachchan. Bachchan's performance is out of this world. His character goes through many phases, and each time you feel he's sinking into it more and more, so much that no words can be found to describe it. Seeing an actor of his calibre still being there, and playing a part with such passion, intensity, emotion, anger and hunger, makes one believe that the sky is the limit. Along with Yuva, Hum Tum and Veer-Zaara, Black is a film that constructs Rani Mukherjee's transformation from an average performer to a mature actress. She plays the character brilliantly. The scene which had her crying on the phone to her mom, is one of her career-best acts. It's cruel that she is cast opposite Bachchan, as she can't take the whole credit to herself, and well, frankly speaking, in my view her role is not as powerful as his, as it is a technical part that requires extensive training rather than soul. It's still a memorable performance, and in her case, if the sky is the limit, Black was probably the sky. Without taking anything from Mukherjee, I was more impressed and amazed by the far more superior performance of Ayesha Kapur, who played the young Michelle to perfection. Kapur is simply flawless in this role.Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a crafted filmmaker who knows his work and his goals very well. In spite of its flaws, Black remains artistic and it is overall a moving movie experience. The words hope, love, dedication and success always come to the mind while watching it. It might not be original, it may be extremely manipulative at points, but the effort that was put into it by the entire cast and crew is evident and appreciable. Black is definitely better than most of the films made in the Hindi film industry. Though for me too it is a mixed bag, I admit that the first time I saw it, I kept thinking of it after the show had ended and for quite some time. This is an achievement few films can achieve (for me), and here's why my high rating.",pretentious yet impressive manipulative yet moving,sanjay leeela bhansalis black is definitely good film it is brilliantly scripted made executed it is also profound complex many have called it pretentious show indeed thats something very obvious annoying im sure bhansali very outset had planned get many awards five star reviews best filmmaker country titles but that said nobody can completely begrudge him since this movie is as impressive well invested as it is ostentatious it deserves hype lets start with saying that technically visually black is treat it boasts fantastic sets wonderful costumes cinematography is incredibly good all these along with superb background score create beautifully dark film having said that this may be exact reason why many viewers found it hard relate thats something i can easily understand particularly after having seen his best feature date khamoshi musical which everything was kept simple here theres no simplicity everything is lavish big grandiose thats why its often labelled pretentious film is emotional yet unsentimental which is good but then one its main flaws is fact that more than once it resorts emotional manipulation trying forcibly wring tears well one thing is sure it is that you can always expect good acting slb film particularly when it has amitabh bachchan bachchans performance is out this world his character goes through many phases each time you feel hes sinking into it more more so much that no words can be found describe it seeing actor his calibre still being there playing part with such passion intensity emotion anger hunger makes one believe that sky is limit along with yuva hum tum veer zaara black is film that constructs rani mukherjees transformation average performer mature actress she plays character brilliantly scene which had her crying phone her mom is one her career best acts its cruel that she is cast opposite bachchan as she cant take whole credit herself well frankly speaking my view her role is not as powerful as his as it is technical part that requires extensive training rather than soul its still memorable performance her case if sky is limit black was probably sky without taking anything mukherjee i was more impressed amazed by far more superior performance ayesha kapur who played young michelle perfection kapur is simply flawless this role sanjay leela bhansali is crafted filmmaker who knows his work his goals very well spite its flaws black remains artistic it is overall moving movie experience words hope love dedication success always come mind while watching it it might not be original it may be extremely manipulative at points but effort that was put into it by entire cast crew is evident appreciable black is definitely better than most films made hindi film industry though me too it is mixed bag i admit that first time i saw it i kept thinking it after show had ended quite some time this is achievement few films can achieve me heres why my high rating,0.5458803138113482,0.24503831417624514,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Why don't people like it?,"Who cares if it's like Miracle Worker....it's still such a beautiful movie. And believe me, it's different and if you stupid, idiotic people can't remember, the movie was made in Helen Keller's honor and they spent a whole day at her institution. And the only it has in common to Miracle Worker is a Deaf and blind girl. The description of the blackness she sees and how in the end she helps Amitabh learn to remember is original.Black Shows darkness in a frightening, confusing, frustrating place, a whirlwind of emotion and anger. Michelle lives in a time where little can be done for her. Anger rots inside her for the frustration she feels for not seeing her sister's face or hear her mother's voice. She's a prisoner. She feels excluded. For hours upon hours she tries to scream but nothing comes out...just distorted noises that she can't even hear. Black is a living hell...until she meets Amitabh bachan's character....her brings light into Michelle's terrifying world.Rani Mukerji is fantastic and she is NOT annoying because you dumb haters just don't see the depth. And she was't just acting like she thought a deaf, mute,and blind person would. They actually spent a day at the institution. Though it strays from the typical musical/love story/gangster-beats-up-hero-but-he-doesn't-care-hes-bloody and/or is dying Indian movie( i think those movies are bull crap), its beautiful!

,Black will be remembered as a 'Classic' in days to come,"Black is an unusual and interesting film in idea and visualization. It's a very special film and there is no doubt; Sanjay Leela Bhansali is among the best talents Indian Film Industry has produced. There have been films like Sadma, Sparsh and Koi Mil Gaya and Sanjay's directorial debut Khamoshi - The Musical, where the protagonists of the films were physically challenged. KHAMOSHI - THE MUSICAL, was a tale of a deaf and dumb couple and their ordinary child. Despite the presence of matinée idols like Salman Khan, Manisha Koirala and Nana Patekar, the film failed. Black cannot be described in sheer words. It has been handled with extreme kindliness and it does boast of a plot that's rarely attempted on the Indian screen. Before this movie, Gulzar made a movie 'Koshish' in early 70's starring Jaya Bhaduri and Sanjeev Kumar for which they have won the awards.Michelle McNally (Ayesha Kapur/Rani Mukerji), born to an Anglo-Indian family, is deaf and blind. She is a bright and intelligent girl and she lives in the world of black and this frustrates her because she desires to speak. Therefore, because of her frustration she becomes harsh and cruel on numerous events.Debraj Sahai (Amitabh Bachchan) is a strange person. He is an alcoholic, a teacher to the deaf and blind children. The principal of the school believes in his ability and sends him to the McNally house to teach Michelle. Debraj's arrival at the McNally home is far from favorable, as he arrives intoxicated, annoyed and impolite. On encountering Michelle, Debraj realizes that the only way to tackle her is to distress her, be violent at times and at the same time, show her the love.Debraj succeeds and Michelle amazingly learns her first word - Ma. But this is just the beginning. There are several battles to be won. His dreams of Michelle going to a college with students without any disability. But, at this stage, Debraj starts to suffer from Alzheimer. He slowly forgets everything including all words and their meanings. The roles are now reversed!Sanjay Leela Bhansali explanation of Helen Keller's outstanding life and the role Annie Sullivan played in her life. The real-life story was presented on the big screen in the 1962's Hollywood flick THE MIRACLE WORKER, which starred Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft for which both the performers won the Oscars.A film like BLACK relies heavily on performances and Bhansali has extracted award-worthy work from practically the entire cast. When you talk of BLACK, it's not just Bachchan or Rani's work you would like to extol, but Shernaz Patel, Nandana Sen, Dhritiman Chaterji and Ayesha Kapur's contribution as well.International Cinematography by Ravi K. Chandran. Each and every frame is laudable of a great compliment. Omung Kumar has created lively sets for the film. The Shimla shopping mall has been reconstructed to precision in Mumbai. Background music by Monty is apt. BLACK belongs to Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukerji primarily. After Khakee and Dev, this one is his best performance and for this role, he felt that for the last 25 years I have been working in the movies but this is the first time that I have shown such an interest. Bachchan comes up with a performance that he'll always be remembered for!There's no denying that Rani delivers her best performance to date and her performance in this movie has topped on the number one spot and crossed her early performances i.e. 'Yuva', 'Hum Tum' and 'Veer - Zaara'. Rani has conveyed through expressions exclusively. Here's a performance that should act as a reference guide for all aspiring actors. And yes, she's bound to walk away with all major awards next year as well!Shernaz Patel is exceptional. Her sequences with Bachchan are awesome. Dhritiman Chaterji is excellent. Nandana Sen impresses in a small but significant role. Ayesha Kapur is first-rate and she should be given a special award next year in every award ceremony. And also Best Perfromances award should be given to Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee. If Bollywood has to move ahead with time we will be open to experiments like this. A must watch for those who like different cinema. After Lagaan, The Legend Of Bhagat Singh, Kaante, Khakee, this is the movie, which can compete with any Hollywood Movie.

10.0,Great Movie! Good Solid Direction! Awesome Performances!!!,"Here's very briefly what the movie is about:It is the story of Helen Keller & Anne Mansfield Sullivan, suitably modified though, to nicely fit into the Bollywood mould.That however should not take anything away from the three main highlights of the film:Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Direction, Rani Mukherjee's execution of a difficult role, & Mr. Amitabh Bachchan!!!Bhansali is best at stories highlighting human struggle. And with this adaptation he comes up trumps once again. He also proves that if you have a great story & just one great actor in a meaty role, you have a hit on your hands. Strange how the so called moguls of Hindi cinema cannot see that!Rani Mukherjee's performance as the Indian Helen Keller (Michelle) is very commendable. It is just her misfortune that she was pitted against Amitabh Bachchan in the BEST Role (Devraj Sahay) of his life!!!Mr. Bachchan tends to dwarf everyone. To all those who doubt that he is the GREATEST Actor this country has produced, go watch Black. You will return transformed for life! From the moment he comes on screen, he mesmerizes you. And he holds you till the last frame of the movie. He gives you goose bumps with his performance. And to think that the effort doesn't even show...Now if only other film makers would give him roles worthy of his calibre as an actor, we could well have our first Best Actor Oscar ever. No kidding. Go see the film!And Oh! I almost forgot. The little girl who plays the young Michelle is the best child actor this author ever seen! And that includes the Macaulay Culkins & Haley Joel Osments of the world!Trust me! Go see the film!",great movie good solid direction awesome performances,heres very briefly what movie is about it is story helen keller anne mansfield sullivan suitably modified though nicely fit into bollywood mould that however should not take anything away three main highlights film sanjay leela bhansalis direction rani mukherjees execution difficult role mr amitabh bachchan bhansali is best at stories highlighting human struggle with this adaptation he comes up trumps once again he also proves that if you have great story just one great actor meaty role you have hit your hands strange how so called moguls hindi cinema cannot see that rani mukherjees performance as indian helen keller michelle is very commendable it is just her misfortune that she was pitted against amitabh bachchan best role devraj sahay his life mr bachchan tends dwarf everyone all those who doubt that he is greatest actor this country has produced go watch black you will return transformed life moment he comes screen he mesmerizes you he holds you till last frame movie he gives you goose bumps with his performance think that effort doesnt even show now if only other film makers would give him roles worthy his calibre as actor we could well have our first best actor oscar ever no kidding go see film oh i almost forgot little girl who plays young michelle is best child actor this author ever seen that includes macaulay culkins haley joel osments world trust me go see film,0.4901785714285715,0.3703869047619047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Black can restore one's faith in life and love,"First things first. On Easter Sunday I pondered whether I should go see the film ""Black"" -- a film about which I had heard nothing in the popular press, until I saw its title on the cinema's Marquee. Not surprising really, since the film appears at this point to have only been released in the specialty Hindi-language Bollywood film circuit in Canada. Which is a real pity because if I had not made an accidental point of presenting myself at a movie-house that was actually screening the picture, as a Euro-heritage native-born Canadian I would likely still be walking around in a typically North American ethno-centric film fog about this excellent picture.When I initially asked the theatre's ticket clerk what ""Black"" was about, his description hardly got me excited. It's the story of a teacher who helps a disabled woman. It didn't sound terribly engaging to me. But boy, was I wrong! While I am not a complete stranger to a number of Bollywood-type films, I'm lucky if I see one or two in a year, and at that, it's usually been because someone else has suggested it. While few of these ""B"" class movies ""deserve"" screen time in mainstream North American theatres, this is hardly the case for ""Black"". It is not a ""B"" class flic.If only because the film's Director Sanjay Bhansali co-wrote the script, this obviously allowed him to imagine how he might want to capture the story with beautiful emotionally-charged cinematography. And what a sophisticated symbolically packed feast it was at that! Yet backing up the impeccable imagery was an equally top-drawer story. One dimension tells the story of a once well-regarded teacher who has come to the end of his financial, if not his existentially-justified rope, a man whose talents are neither fully recognized or completely appreciated. Then during this 11th hour turmoil, he receives a letter asking for help from the parents of a young deaf and blind girl. Her story is of course equally gripping, a girl effectively trapped in an internal prison in which language, a vital connector within herself as well as to the outside world, is missing. In this sense, both characters need one another, for both are on the common and all too true brink of being ""disposable people"" - people ripe relegated to become out-of-sight out-of-mind statistics in a faceless institution.This feature of the story speaks to a possibility few of us care to contemplate, namely: ""Who would care for me if everything fell to pieces?"". It is a possibility reminiscent of and anchored in a time when as children we depended entirely on our parents for nurturance and love. This I think is what gives this story its privileged access to the inner-recesses of our deep emotional need for interconnection. And because it is a story told as much with emotionally poignant visuals as it is with emotionally gripping dialogue, these have a way of by-passing the usual intellectual filters we erect to both define and ""protect"" ourselves from one another. This film will have none of that. And the emotionally-forceful performances offered by the male and female leads simply seal our fates, leading us to co-journey with them in their heroic quest to find the light that will illumine us as much as them.Few are the number of viewers who could experience this film and not leave better people, if only because it succeeds in allowing us to recognize the value of caring for one another as the greatest triumph, if not the most important ingredient in all of our other successes as a species. In short, this film strives to restore one's faith in the value of life and love, and does very well in that task. And what more can anyone ask from any motion picture? It is a work of genius, well executed, and a triumph of film-making, regardless the culture. Which is why I believe it deserves a lofty 10.",black can restore ones faith life love,first things first easter sunday i pondered whether i should go see film black film about which i had heard nothing popular press until i saw its title cinemas marquee not surprising really since film appears at this point have only been released specialty hindi language bollywood film circuit canada which is real pity because if i had not made accidental point presenting myself at movie house that was actually screening picture as euro heritage native born canadian i would likely still be walking around typically north american ethno centric film fog about this excellent picture when i initially asked theatres ticket clerk what black was about his description hardly got me excited its story teacher who helps disabled woman it didnt sound terribly engaging me but boy was i wrong while i am not complete stranger number bollywood type films im lucky if i see one or two year at that its usually been because someone else has suggested it while few these b class movies deserve screen time mainstream north american theatres this is hardly case black it is not b class flic if only because films director sanjay bhansali co wrote script this obviously allowed him imagine how he might want capture story with beautiful emotionally charged cinematography what sophisticated symbolically packed feast it was at that yet backing up impeccable imagery was equally top drawer story one dimension tells story once well regarded teacher who has come end his financial if not his existentially justified rope man whose talents are neither fully recognized or completely appreciated then during this 11th hour turmoil he receives letter asking help parents young deaf blind girl her story is course equally gripping girl effectively trapped internal prison which language vital connector within herself as well as outside world is missing this sense both characters need one another both are common all too true brink being disposable people people ripe relegated become out sight out mind statistics faceless institution this feature story speaks possibility few us care contemplate namely who would care me if everything fell pieces it is possibility reminiscent anchored time when as children we depended entirely our parents nurturance love this i think is what gives this story its privileged access inner recesses our deep emotional need interconnection because it is story told as much with emotionally poignant visuals as it is with emotionally gripping dialogue these have way by passing usual intellectual filters we erect both define protect ourselves one another this film will have none that emotionally forceful performances offered by male female leads simply seal our fates leading us co journey with them their heroic quest find light that will illumine us as much as them few are number viewers who could experience this film not leave better people if only because it succeeds allowing us recognize value caring one another as greatest triumph if not most important ingredient all our other successes as species short this film strives restore ones faith value life love does very well that task what more can anyone ask any motion picture it is work genius well executed triumph film making regardless culture which is why i believe it deserves lofty 10,0.47772938443670143,0.11971544715447152,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.34}"

1.0,And this is supposed to be Bhansali's masterpiece?!,"This review cannot contain a spoiler as there is not much in the movie to ""spoil"" for you. It could spoil your mood however.For starters, this is a remake of a 1960s film based on Helen Keller's life. Bhansali and his team decided not to acknowledge that fact (there is no mention anywhere in the credits).Amitabh Bachchan had said that this was to be an important film, he was thrilled that Bhansali had chosen him for the tutor's role. Did he not realize (or was he not told) that it was Annie Sullivan in the original role in Miracle Worker? Wow, its amazing that Bhansali took Bachhan for a ride , of all people. In the process, he has also insulted Indian and non-Indian movie-going audiences by shamelessly copying, and not even acknowledging that it was inspired by another film on the same subject.The film treats the subject matter really insensitively and manages to make a mockery of the DP and editor's work, as well as lay to waste the fine acting skills of AB and Rani Mukherjee. Instead of trying to make the ultimate cinematographic masterpiece (it is far from that), if they had just focused on how to craft a good story, at least modify original version to where it became enjoyable, esp. as an Indian remake.The makers of such films seem to be smug and arrogant in their beliefs that simply throwing gobs of money results in good work. When will they learn anything?

The concept,acting,direction and screenplay was superb. This is one of the few movies which got potential to bind u emotionally with the movie . THe best part was SLB tried something very diff and took huge risk by doing something which was never done before. No songs and very apt music which runs throughout the movie. I do agree that this movie certainly deserves an Oscar and i do agree that it was totally framed for it as the length of the movie, most of the dialogs in English,total British background, Cristian characters but i guess this can bring golden era to bollywood which is already contributing maximum no. of movies(even more than Hollywood) by providing some excellent works.

I read a LOT of reviews where people said they couldn't sleep after watching this flick. Sorry, just couldn't feel that way. I watched it, and forgot abt it. Didn't find it emotionally engaging enough.....which is typical of movies directed by SLB who once again focuses more on the technical aspects of the movie then the human side of it. Now, I'm not saying Black's a DUD. Far from it, in fact. The cinematography is brilliant, even if it sometimes takes the focus away from the narrative. The performances are legendary and clearly the heart and soul of the movie. Rani and AB deserve all the accolades they get. The little girl, although a tad overrated IMO, was good too. But still, the movie is lacking that ""juice"" where you instantly fall in love with everything - ESPECIALLY the characters and their lives.Overall, good, but not THAT good.",little hollow nah,one would expect storyline like this be emotional experience but i had hard time feeling characters i read lot reviews where people said they couldnt sleep after watching this flick sorry just couldnt feel that way i watched it forgot abt it didnt find it emotionally engaging enough which is typical movies directed by slb who once again focuses more technical aspects movie then human side it now im not saying blacks dud far it fact cinematography is brilliant even if it sometimes takes focus away narrative performances are legendary clearly heart soul movie rani ab deserve all accolades they get little girl although tad overrated imo was good too but still movie is lacking that juice where you instantly fall love with everything especially characters their lives overall good but not that good,0.5692028985507245,0.18115942028985507,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,"'...lovely, dark and deep'","'lovely, dark and deep'Black Dir- Sanjay Leela Bhansali Cast- Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee, Ayesha Kapur, Nandana Sen, Dhritiman Chaterji and Shernaz Patel. Written by- Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Bhavani Iyer and Prakash Kapadia. Rating- *****As the credits began to roll at the end of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's therapeutic parable 'Black', I remained seated for a few seconds- stunned, mesmerized and completely enamoured. I had witnessed magic- that rare phenomenon in cinema which makes you speechless with awe! 'Black' is unarguably the best film in years to have come out of our industry. Based loosely on the life of Helen Keller- that deafblind woman who defied the whole world and probably God himself- 'Black' is about Michelle McNally(Rani Mukherjee), who cannot see, hear or speak. The movie begins with her quest to find Debraj Sahai(Amitabh Bachchan), that person who had led her into the light when all that her destiny promised was an emptiness without sights, sounds or speech. She finds Debraj, old and worn out, in an asylum- suffering from Alzheimer. Debraj has forgotten everything. Through Michelle's determination to remind Debraj of his achievement with her, we are taken inside the story of how Debraj helped Michelle. Debraj had entered young Michelle's(Ayesha Kapur) life as the last straw of hope for her mother, Catherine Mcnally(Shernaz Patel). There is a thin line between mental retardation and the frustrated rage of a child that has been denied three out of the five senses. What Michelle's father(Dhritiman Chaterji) perceives as nuisance, Debraj sees as a desperate attempt to fight- fight her destiny. Watch as young Michelle punches her fist in the air, trying to break out of the void and reach out to something. Debraj uses Michelle's anger and channels it to free her out of darkness's bondage. He teaches her to finger-spell, but she only seems to imitate without really understanding what the words mean. Then, in a brilliantly shot scene, Debraj drags(yes, he drags her) Michelle to a water-fountain and, like with Helen Keller, throws her in it for her impudence. As Michelle feels the touch of water, she is filled with a desire to know what it is. Her first tacit word is water, and she goes on a frenzied zest to learn new words as she feels everything. Debraj guides Michelle through her life from a girl to a woman who aspires to be a graduate. But concomitant to her progress is the deterioration of Debraj. A man that has always thumbed his nose to life itself, is harshly being swallowed by life. A man that helped Michelle reach out of the darkness is slowly walking into it himself. ""It is not about sight, but darkness"", says Debraj during a conversation with Catherine. Cinematographer Ravi Chandran achieves this sentiment splendidly throughout the movie in a work that would've done the late great Conrad L. Hall proud! Note also how Omung Kumar uses the contrast of black and white when Michelle meets Debraj in the asylum. It is amazing how the movie resembles a magnificent canvas, with primarily the use of only two colours- black and white! Bhansali's direction is top-notch. Watch closely as he drops a hint on the period of the film. I'll give you a clue- it's got to do with Charlie Chaplin! Moreover, never before has Robert Frost's 'Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening' been put to better use. As we are introduced to a weary and tired Debraj, watch how Frost's most quoted lines reflect on all the walls around him. In fact, every frame of the movie is symbolic. Mr. Bhansali, take a bow! Special mention needs to be made of Bhavani Iyer's imaginative English dialogues in her debut feature. Rani Mukherjee performs exceedingly well in a role that is both challenging and has the utmost potential to overact. But she restrains herself from going over the top. However, it is the little Ayesha Kapur as young Michelle that completely steals the thunder from Rani. Hers is a performance that resembles very much to Shamili's in Mani Ratnam's 'Anjali', but yet different. As I stated earlier, there is a thin line between retardation and frustrated anger. Ayesha manages to stay on the saner side of that line. Finally though, this movie is unimaginable without Amitabh Bachchan. In what is his career's best work, Bachchan gives a powerhouse performance that reminds you of Al Pacino. Whether it is his humming an unfamiliar tune or his mouthing Frost, his eccentric wit or his calm concentration, and his sudden anger or his contented smile- Mr. Bachchan goes through the whole range of emotions with effortlessness. His eyes speak a thousand words, and you can see the pain, the sorrow, the defeat and the victory in them even before he speaks- especially as he begins to lose grip over his memory. 'Black' is a well-made, well-intentioned film. When I had entered the cinema-hall, the lights had already gone and I had to ask the usher to help me in the darkness. But two hours later, Bhansali had guided me into the light!Abhishek BandekarRating- ****** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent4th February, 2005",lovely dark deep,lovely dark deepblack dir sanjay leela bhansali cast amitabh bachchan rani mukherjee ayesha kapur nandana sen dhritiman chaterji shernaz patel written by sanjay leela bhansali bhavani iyer prakash kapadia rating as credits began roll at end sanjay leela bhansalis therapeutic parable black i remained seated few seconds stunned mesmerized completely enamoured i had witnessed magic that rare phenomenon cinema which makes you speechless with awe black is unarguably best film years have come out our industry based loosely life helen keller that deafblind woman who defied whole world probably god himself black is about michelle mcnally rani mukherjee who cannot see hear or speak movie begins with her quest find debraj sahai amitabh bachchan that person who had led her into light when all that her destiny promised was emptiness without sights sounds or speech she finds debraj old worn out asylum suffering alzheimer debraj has forgotten everything through michelles determination remind debraj his achievement with her we are taken inside story how debraj helped michelle debraj had entered young michelles ayesha kapur life as last straw hope her mother catherine mcnally shernaz patel there is thin line between mental retardation frustrated rage child that has been denied three out five senses what michelles father dhritiman chaterji perceives as nuisance debraj sees as desperate attempt fight fight her destiny watch as young michelle punches her fist air trying break out void reach out something debraj uses michelles anger channels it free her out darknesss bondage he teaches her finger spell but she only seems imitate without really understanding what words mean then brilliantly shot scene debraj drags yes he drags her michelle water fountain like with helen keller throws her it her impudence as michelle feels touch water she is filled with desire know what it is her first tacit word is water she goes frenzied zest learn new words as she feels everything debraj guides michelle through her life girl woman who aspires be graduate but concomitant her progress is deterioration debraj man that has always thumbed his nose life itself is harshly being swallowed by life man that helped michelle reach out darkness is slowly walking into it himself it is not about sight but darkness says debraj during conversation with catherine cinematographer ravi chandran achieves this sentiment splendidly throughout movie work that wouldve done late great conrad l hall proud note also how omung kumar uses contrast black white when michelle meets debraj asylum it is amazing how movie resembles magnificent canvas with primarily use only two colours black white bhansalis direction is top notch watch closely as he drops hint period film ill give you clue its got do with charlie chaplin moreover never before has robert frosts stopping by woods snowy evening been put better use as we are introduced weary tired debraj watch how frosts most quoted lines reflect all walls around him fact every frame movie is symbolic mr bhansali take bow special mention needs be made bhavani iyers imaginative english dialogues her debut feature rani mukherjee performs exceedingly well role that is both challenging has utmost potential overact but she restrains herself going over top however it is little ayesha kapur as young michelle that completely steals thunder rani hers is performance that resembles very much shamilis mani ratnams anjali but yet different as i stated earlier there is thin line between retardation frustrated anger ayesha manages stay saner side that line finally though this movie is unimaginable without amitabh bachchan what is his careers best work bachchan gives powerhouse performance that reminds you al pacino whether it is his humming unfamiliar tune or his mouthing frost his eccentric wit or his calm concentration his sudden anger or his contented smile mr bachchan goes through whole range emotions with effortlessness his eyes speak thousand words you can see pain sorrow defeat victory them even before he speaks especially as he begins lose grip over his memory black is well made well intentioned film when i had entered cinema hall lights had already gone i had ask usher help me darkness but two hours later bhansali had guided me into light abhishek bandekarrating poor average good very good excellent4th february 2005,0.5400325878940336,0.10746887650502106,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.29}"
5.0,Pretentious sensitivity - The insider's story,"The story of making of Black is something like this (as against the one given by SLB that he got this idea while making Khamoshee, a film he wanted to make since he'd seen Gulzar's Koshish): Screenwriter Prakash Kapadia (Devdas, Black) met Bhansali at the premiere of P Kapadia's Gujarati film Dariya Chhoru (directed by Vipul Shah of Aankhen fame). Bhansali was invited to the screening by Aatish Kapadia (writer of Aankhen and the then screenwriter of Devdas). Bhansali came up to Prakash Kapadia after the screening and told him, ""You are the real hero of the film."" Of course, a few days later, Aatish Kapadia was replaced by Prakash Kapadia to write Devdas for SLB. During the making of Devdas and later, Prakash Kapadia would discuss all his plays (some 20 great stories that he made in his 20 year long illustrious theatre career). Among these, were two plays: one was a story called ""Aatam Vinjhe Paankh"", a Gujarati play inspired straight from ""The Miracle Worker"" and the other was a story of an ageing teacher suffering from the Alzheimer's. Post Devdas, Bhansali asked PK to render the story of Bajirao and Mastani for him. While PK was busy with that, Bhansali clubbed the two stories of Miracle Worker and Alzhiemer's, with the help of co-writer Bhavani Iyer and developed a complete English script titled ""Black"". When he sent the script to PK, PK rejected most of the screenplay as dry and dull. With PK entering the scene, it was decided that SLB will make a bilingual film instead of an out-and-out English film. SLB approached the Helen Keller Institute for rights and assistance. He was denied the rights, but was offered the assistance. So the secondary level problem had now become a primary one. They had to deviate from Helen Keller's life and The Miracle Worker as much as they could. They gave a thank you note to the institute in the film, but couldn't mention anywhere that Black is indeed inspired from the Miracle Worker or Keller's life. Problem 2 was they had to expand the role of Debraj's character because it was going to be played by Amitabh Bachhan. In this confusion of events, they ended up creating a mess out of a great story. They maintained Anne Sullivan's character of a half blind teacher (Bachhan getting the eye drops from Ms. Nayar), but added Alzhiemer's to it for further drama and forced sensitivity. They maintained most of the other characters, but couldn't use the real names, though they ended up using the same costume, setting and make-up. They didn't use the same education techniques of Anne Sullivan and because of their lack of imagination, they ended up making a 60-year old frustrated compulsive brute instead of a compassionate imaginative teacher. They still used the high points in Keller's life like the fountain ""water"" scene. For those who defend this kind of plagiarism by saying that remakes are made all the time, are forgetting a basic priciple - remakes are made after acquiring the rights from the original. SLB and PK didn't research through archives and works of Keller, but instead just relied on an artiste's rendering of her life ""The Miracle Worker"". Several films are made with Gandhi in it, but they do not show a man named ""McNally"" getting thrown out of a train for being brown and inventing satyagraha. Get my point?Upward downward arrogant pretentious cinema designed for awards and critical appreciation in a country which has had very little collective self analysis in the last 50 years. I think that pretty much defines Black. It makes the semi-intellectual and pseudo-sensitive life forms to feel important and profound for having the ability to identify and appreciate ""great"" cinema. I'll compare this feeling to the way the English speaking Indian elite feel about themselves. Though they won't admit it, deep down they still carry the genes of slavery, and feel proud to be on the same level as the ""international"" (read American) English speaking communities. That's precisely the problem with this kind of contorted cinema. Just because a film looks like a Hollywood Oscar winning film, doesn't mean that it's a good film. Black is empty of substance. It doesn't make any attempt in understanding the inner world of a person born deaf and blind, while creating an illusion that it's in fact doing so.Good stepping stone for just out-of-the-cocoon-self-proclaimed-film-analysts-and-intellectuals, though.",pretentious sensitivity insiders story,story making black is something like this as against one given by slb that he got this idea while making khamoshee film he wanted make since hed seen gulzars koshish screenwriter prakash kapadia devdas black met bhansali at premiere p kapadias gujarati film dariya chhoru directed by vipul shah aankhen fame bhansali was invited screening by aatish kapadia writer aankhen then screenwriter devdas bhansali came up prakash kapadia after screening told him you are real hero film course few days later aatish kapadia was replaced by prakash kapadia write devdas slb during making devdas later prakash kapadia would discuss all his plays some 20 great stories that he made his 20 year long illustrious theatre career among these were two plays one was story called aatam vinjhe paankh gujarati play inspired straight miracle worker other was story ageing teacher suffering alzheimers post devdas bhansali asked pk render story bajirao mastani him while pk was busy with that bhansali clubbed two stories miracle worker alzhiemers with help co writer bhavani iyer developed complete english script titled black when he sent script pk pk rejected most screenplay as dry dull with pk entering scene it was decided that slb will make bilingual film instead out out english film slb approached helen keller institute rights assistance he was denied rights but was offered assistance so secondary level problem had now become primary one they had deviate helen kellers life miracle worker as much as they could they gave thank you note institute film but couldnt mention anywhere that black is indeed inspired miracle worker or kellers life problem 2 was they had expand role debrajs character because it was going be played by amitabh bachhan this confusion events they ended up creating mess out great story they maintained anne sullivans character half blind teacher bachhan getting eye drops ms nayar but added alzhiemers it further drama forced sensitivity they maintained most other characters but couldnt use real names though they ended up using same costume setting make up they didnt use same education techniques anne sullivan because their lack imagination they ended up making 60 year old frustrated compulsive brute instead compassionate imaginative teacher they still used high points kellers life like fountain water scene those who defend this kind plagiarism by saying that remakes are made all time are forgetting basic priciple remakes are made after acquiring rights original slb pk didnt research through archives works keller but instead just relied artistes rendering her life miracle worker several films are made with gandhi it but they do not show man named mcnally getting thrown out train being brown inventing satyagraha get my point upward downward arrogant pretentious cinema designed awards critical appreciation country which has had very little collective self analysis last 50 years i think that pretty much defines black it makes semi intellectual pseudo sensitive life forms feel important profound having ability identify appreciate great cinema ill compare this feeling way english speaking indian elite feel about themselves though they wont admit it deep down they still carry genes slavery feel proud be same level as international read american english speaking communities thats precisely problem with this kind contorted cinema just because film looks like hollywood oscar winning film doesnt mean that its good film black is empty substance it doesnt make any attempt understanding inner world person born deaf blind while creating illusion that its fact doing so good stepping stone just out cocoon self proclaimed film analysts intellectuals though,0.43884759759759745,0.07238551051051052,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"

1.0,I prefer WHITE!!,"""Black is the answer to all Hollywood's misgivings till date"" ""Bhansali's Black is comparable to any of contemporary cinema's classics."" Blahblahblah..Now time for some truth.. Hear it from the horse's mouth. Ladies and Gentlemen: presenting before you the man himself Feel blessed, feel honored. The final word on the most confusingly reviewed and misinterpreted movie of all times.yes you are bang right, we are talking about the much raved about, famously pronounced as ""The sole deserving candidate for the academy awards"", a masterpiece of art, creation beyond comparison or even explanation, a movie so huge you feel like disappearing in thin air when it rolls, and wish you could run away from those pretentious pricks applauding in the dark asylum amidst an alarming vacuum of misconception and misinterpretation, and may be catch something subtle at home, for a change, far from the maddening crowds, who rejoice at every howl, who jump at every brawl.. Take me away, O lords of my destiny, if this is BLACK, I prefer WHITE! This is easily the most misconceived movies of all times, at least in the Indian celluloid history. The minute the movie rolled, and I saw a schizophrenic Amitabh, I knew what was coming, and guess what, I was RIGHT! The protagonist, the small girl looks like an Indian impersonation of the two girls from The Ring and The Exorcist, with due apologies and respect to Verbinski and Friedkin, respectively, who keeps howling all the time as if she has just come back from watching Black. She looks like she went to see Sixth Sense and missed THE scene. Agreed that it was supposed to be a DARK movie, agreed that they were supposed to garner sympathy and tears for its hollering monologue sessions, and agreed that as human beings you do tend to get swept away in the stream of emotions so basic to our survival, but tell me one thing. Where were the emotions?! All I found was noisy confrontations all through the tiring 95 minutes (well if the actual movie is longer, I would kiss the guy who gave me an edited DVD!) in first few minutes of the movie, I thought it will take me a while to get attuned to the dark, unexpressed emotions, but when it didn't affect me a penny, I started getting worried about my reaction time and nerve impulses' functioning. But they were not to be blamed, may be I have seen way too many movies by now that such blown-up sagas of pathos don't influence me any longer even in the minutest possible way. The movie did have some inspiring aspects, like the sets, the camera, the lights, but let me add just one thing, they all were looking way too Victorian to fit the depicted time period in the movie! Amidst all this mumbo-jumbo of Black making it to the Oscars, I have some thousand thirty inhibitions about the remote possibility of that being true. The movie attempts a daring depiction and storyline of disabled people, which is a very commendable step to start with. They have even tried showing the constricted views of the world towards the chances of their betterment to a certain successful extent. But if the moviemakers had embarked upon such a noble task of diverting the attention of the hackneyed audience, who have become used to the song and dance routine much too often now, may be they should have worked a little more into understanding as to what their world is all about, beyond the stereotypical BLACK that they keep hammering from pillar to post. I understand that Black substantiates their concept and symbolizes a world devoid of all things colorful and lively, but couldn't they leave a few things to the intelligent audience's imagination, an assumption that they sure must have made while spending such obscene amounts(read a fifteen crores INR!). A few things like the much-publicized KISS between the lead actors, which truly I was imagining all the time waiting for it! This could have been a rare creation by Mumbai cinema, considering the oodles of moolah they waste on lavish sets and costumes, which make no sense whatsoever. All the movie relies on is gaining sympathy on characters oozing with self-pity and pretence.

2.0,No miracle director,"India is a remarkable movie country: As they have the highest output on the planet, Bollywood movies also have consistently low cinematic qualities, certainly when compared to other Asian nations nearby where the reverse seems to be true. As most Bollywood actors and directors do way too many movies, it gives them ample time to prepare decently. Despite strong criticism from serious Indian filmmakers having difficulty (like their American counterparts) to get funding for more important movies, Bollywood changes little over the years (money is made so why change). In this context Black is an interesting one, because it breaks several Bollywood rules: no songs between drama and aiming for intelligent storytelling, good acting and good direction. The story is about a teacher for deaf blind children raising her from a retard to the level of a BA at university.Let's start with the pluses. As the director Sanjay Leela Bhansali starts with music first, this movie is very music-driven and tries to establish a rhythm to walk through the story. It has at least a structure as it begins with some scenes from the end (unfortunately giving away some of the ending): A funeral, an asylum where Sahai is confined. Later on, the movie handles with some emotion the lack of a love life of Michelle, as she even falls in love with her own teacher. Michelle and Sahai change roles in the movie, thereby telling something about the sacrifices made and knowledge and wisdom passed on from generation to generation.But the compelling story is often told in an awkward manner: Debraj Sahai the teacher has for instance unusual methods, but they are not brought to the screen very insightful or with much imagination. He shouts, screams, is patient, but that doesn't explain the success he has. By the way, on several instances in the movie, it was forgotten by the makers that Michelle can neither hear nor see. Michelle's sister comes with a confession about her behavior towards Michelle on the announcement of her own engagement, a rather strange moment to do so. Too many story lines are drawn out to uninteresting lengths, for example the graduation speech is way too long, combined with laughable images of Sahai walking like a lunatic in an asylum, not very likely for a person with Alzheimer's (he is also chained in the asylum where I would prefer to send no people with psychiatric problems). All in all this director has no clue about editing and taking the core out of a storyline, therefore all emotions present in the basic story are not enhanced by this movie but severely diminished. Meanwhile torturing the audience once again with a long and uninteresting piece of dialog told in the wrong pace. The story a copy of The Miracle Worker; that movie or Children of a Lesser God (about a deaf child) are both superior movies compared to this one. Here I felt sorry for the actors having to work with this kind of material. And please do your homework next time by researching a subject thoroughly.",no miracle director,india is remarkable movie country as they have highest output planet bollywood movies also have consistently low cinematic qualities certainly when compared other asian nations nearby where reverse seems be true as most bollywood actors directors do way too many movies it gives them ample time prepare decently despite strong criticism serious indian filmmakers having difficulty like their american counterparts get funding more important movies bollywood changes little over years money is made so why change this context black is interesting one because it breaks several bollywood rules no songs between drama aiming intelligent storytelling good acting good direction story is about teacher deaf blind children raising her retard level ba at university lets start with pluses as director sanjay leela bhansali starts with music first this movie is very music driven tries establish rhythm walk through story it has at least structure as it begins with some scenes end unfortunately giving away some ending funeral asylum where sahai is confined later movie handles with some emotion lack love life michelle as she even falls love with her own teacher michelle sahai change roles movie thereby telling something about sacrifices made knowledge wisdom passed generation generation but compelling story is often told awkward manner debraj sahai teacher has instance unusual methods but they are not brought screen very insightful or with much imagination he shouts screams is patient but that doesnt explain success he has by way several instances movie it was forgotten by makers that michelle can neither hear nor see michelles sister comes with confession about her behavior towards michelle announcement her own engagement rather strange moment do so too many story lines are drawn out uninteresting lengths example graduation speech is way too long combined with laughable images sahai walking like lunatic asylum not very likely person with alzheimers he is also chained asylum where i would prefer send no people with psychiatric problems all all this director has no clue about editing taking core out storyline therefore all emotions present basic story are not enhanced by this movie but severely diminished meanwhile torturing audience once again with long uninteresting piece dialog told wrong pace story copy miracle worker that movie or children lesser god about deaf child are both superior movies compared this one here i felt sorry actors having work with this kind material please do your homework next time by researching subject thoroughly,0.5127016258595205,0.11640559732664996,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,It's an excellent film but why does Mr. Sahai YELL so often and talk so much?!,"""Black"" is an incredibly stylized and sumptuous reworking of the American play/movie ""The Miracle Worker"". One of the changes in the story is that it's set in Shimla, India*--another is that there is a bizarre and highly problematic plot twist that you learn at the beginning of the film--but more about this later.A rich Indian family has a blind/deaf daughter who is in many ways like an animal. She's never been taught and living with this wild child is nearly impossible. As a last resort, the family hires a non-conventional teacher, Mr. Sahai (Amitabh Bachchan)--and if this doesn't work out, they'll put the child in an institution. However, two problems occur with the plot. First, the parents are supposed to be very, very desperate but give up on the teacher almost immediately. Second, the teacher is very unconventional--I get that. But why doesn't he ever stop to explain to the parents what he's doing and why?! They want to fire him and I might have felt the same, as Sahai seemed a bit crazed--too crazed.Despite a very, very poor start, eventually Mr. Sahai makes a breakthrough and young Michelle begins to communicate and behave much more normally. Some of this is touching--some utterly ridiculous.Now here is the plot twist. At the beginning of the film, before all these flashback scenes, you learn that Mr. Sahai (in the present time) no longer recognizes Michelle nor anyone. This is because he's developed Alzheimer's! Now, you see Michelle trying to communicate with and teach him. But, the film bounces around in time--and it starts at the present, goes back to Michelle at age 8, then about 20 and then about 40 (approximately). Now you see her applying to the university--and communicating up a storm! What's next? See this film as describing it's unconventional timeline is a bit difficult.I have a different insight into this film than the average viewer. I have a deaf daughter and I have seen ""The Miracle Worker"". While it does NOT make me an expert on working with the blind/deaf--but it does help me understand that a lot of what I saw in ""Black"" is a bit ridiculous. While Amitabh Bachchan is a wonderful actor (I've loved him in many other films and he IS good here), I kept thinking that the experts that consulted on this film didn't do a great job of getting it right. After all, he is supposed to be teaching a blind/deaf kid to communicate...so WHY DOES HE YELL AT THE KID?! And, why does he talk so much?! I know he's doing it to convey information to the viewer, but this is silly--a real teacher of the blind/deaf wouldn't do this and I think it would have been better if either you could have heard his character's thoughts OR if there had been subtitles explaining his actions. Simply yelling and talking non-stop when teaching a child like this make no sense at all. What he would have done (and it only happens some in this film) is to either draw letters with his fingers on her skin or do sign language as she felt his fingers. He should NOT talk at the kid...again and again and again!! Also, my deaf daughter never learned to talk as quickly as Michelle did in the film since she cannot hear what's being said--and this is true of anyone who is dead! Words like 'Ma' and 'teacher' would have been far, far more difficult to learn than you see here in ""Black"". How could Michelle learn this so quickly?! Now despite these serious problems, I am not saying ""Black"" is a bad film--just that it is very, very simplistic and not exactly realistic. I did enjoy it and recommend it--I just wished the filmmakers had done their homework a bit better. It is enjoyable and lovely to see and hear. It's also a bit unusual because (appropriately so) there are no song and dance numbers--something usually seen in Indian romantic dramas. But, most importantly, I loved the performance of Rani Mukerji as the adult Michelle--very nice and very inspiring.*Shimla is located in the far north-central part of India--north of Delhi and near the Kashmir region.",its excellent film but why does mr sahai yell so often talk so much,black is incredibly stylized sumptuous reworking american play movie miracle worker one changes story is that its set shimla india another is that there is bizarre highly problematic plot twist that you learn at beginning film but more about this later rich indian family has blind deaf daughter who is many ways like animal shes never been taught living with this wild child is nearly impossible as last resort family hires non conventional teacher mr sahai amitabh bachchan if this doesnt work out theyll put child institution however two problems occur with plot first parents are supposed be very very desperate but give up teacher almost immediately second teacher is very unconventional i get that but why doesnt he ever stop explain parents what hes doing why they want fire him i might have felt same as sahai seemed bit crazed too crazed despite very very poor start eventually mr sahai makes breakthrough young michelle begins communicate behave much more normally some this is touching some utterly ridiculous now here is plot twist at beginning film before all these flashback scenes you learn that mr sahai present time no longer recognizes michelle nor anyone this is because hes developed alzheimers now you see michelle trying communicate with teach him but film bounces around time it starts at present goes back michelle at age 8 then about 20 then about 40 approximately now you see her applying university communicating up storm whats next see this film as describing its unconventional timeline is bit difficult i have different insight into this film than average viewer i have deaf daughter i have seen miracle worker while it does not make me expert working with blind deaf but it does help me understand that lot what i saw black is bit ridiculous while amitabh bachchan is wonderful actor ive loved him many other films he is good here i kept thinking that experts that consulted this film didnt do great job getting it right after all he is supposed be teaching blind deaf kid communicate so why does he yell at kid why does he talk so much i know hes doing it convey information viewer but this is silly real teacher blind deaf wouldnt do this i think it would have been better if either you could have heard his characters thoughts or if there had been subtitles explaining his actions simply yelling talking non stop when teaching child like this make no sense at all what he would have done it only happens some this film is either draw letters with his fingers her skin or do sign language as she felt his fingers he should not talk at kid again again again also my deaf daughter never learned talk as quickly as michelle did film since she cannot hear whats being said this is true anyone who is dead words like ma teacher would have been far far more difficult learn than you see here black how could michelle learn this so quickly now despite these serious problems i am not saying black is bad film just that it is very very simplistic not exactly realistic i did enjoy it recommend it i just wished filmmakers had done their homework bit better it is enjoyable lovely see hear its also bit unusual because appropriately so there are no song dance numbers something usually seen indian romantic dramas but most importantly i loved performance rani mukerji as adult michelle very nice very inspiring shimla is located far north central part india north delhi near kashmir region,0.5543574297188754,0.0967814113597246,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"
6.0,Fake. Pretentious. Designed for awards.,"I fail to see any mastery in the narrative of the most celebrated film of this year. Black. (loosely inspired from the 1962 film ""The Miracle Worker"" based on Helen Keller's life.) Debraj (Bacchan), the stereotypically cranky genius teacher of Michelle (Mukherjee), a girl born deaf and blind, was supposed to enter a magician - I would have loved to see a Robin Williams there - of Dead Poets' Society, of Patch Adams, of Goodwill Hunting, of the Hook or for that matter a Johny Depp of Finding Neverland or Philippe Noiret of Cinema Paradiso - a magician, a creative genius, a compassionate, enlightened and colourful wizard. What I got instead was a brainless brute for a pedagogically wrong teacher, a monster who incessantly shouts on through the first half of the film at a child he knows can't even hear. The scenes with most potential are the ones treated with most preempted melodrama and least substance. The sequence where Debraj finally gets to training his student for twenty days, for example. Here, director Bhansali, largely considered a master of mis-en-scene, succumbs to hiding the lack of research and screenplay material behind a touch and go montage, squeezing the whole story of Michelle's training (loosely based on Anne Sullivan's struggle to teach communication to the blind and deaf Helen Keller), which is later going to develop into the second plot point of the film. Michelle's world remains relatively unexplored throughout the film, but for melodramatic purposes. There are infinite references to the title in the dialogue, but we never understand how is Black different to green or scarlet or turquoise to a completely deaf and blind girl when she is not even aware of the existence of other colours to make a comparative statement like that. There wasn't a single reference to her training in colour references or rhythm recognition, again something that gets hidden under Ravi Chandran's immaculate chiaroscuro. Each frame of Chandran's could be printed as a work of art, but his cinematography was largely incoherent with the narrative. I'd flatter it to say that for me, it reached Conrad Hall levels, but failed to show me either Michelle's or Debraj's world, and stayed confused between the two, like the narrative, itself. Art director Omung Kumar successfully creates an Eastern Europe in North India, but leads Chandran in incoherency with the story. Robert Frost's 'Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening' has been used on the walls of a sign linguist's house, where one expects to see a dictionary of homespun signs and words inscribed on the walls. McNally's Anglo-Indian house looks like a museum, where Shernaz Patel gives a tiresome performance as a postcard. The Hindi dialogue of the film belongs to a story like Devdas and the English dialogue belongs in a Class 5 Balbharati textbook. The semi-final blow comes when director Bhansali rips off a scene from his own film Khamoshee. The emotionally pulsating climax of Khamoshee where Nana's character gives a thank you speech in sign language becomes a tearjerker pre-climax in Black, with Rani swapping places with Nana, and Shernaz with Manisha. The climax again is brilliant, you are just about to say, ""good, at least caught one out of the many juggled balls"", when comes the final blow - the dénouement. A yet another mumbled painting. Now some great scenes quickly - the first hospital scene where Bacchan is walking in one direction and Rani in the other; the ""enlightenment"" scene where Bacchan throws Rani in water; the party scene where Rani lip reads the singer, the campus bench scene where Rani teases Bacchan about the snowfall she predicted, not giving him the umbrella; the kiss scene; the only melodramatic scene in this list - the climax, ""water"". First Swades, then Black. Indeed, it is a great phase for Indian Cinema - the phase of transition.",fake pretentious designed awards,i fail see any mastery narrative most celebrated film this year black loosely inspired 1962 film miracle worker based helen kellers life debraj bacchan stereotypically cranky genius teacher michelle mukherjee girl born deaf blind was supposed enter magician i would have loved see robin williams there dead poets society patch adams goodwill hunting hook or that matter johny depp finding neverland or philippe noiret cinema paradiso magician creative genius compassionate enlightened colourful wizard what i got instead was brainless brute pedagogically wrong teacher monster who incessantly shouts through first half film at child he knows cant even hear scenes with most potential are ones treated with most preempted melodrama least substance sequence where debraj finally gets training his student twenty days example here director bhansali largely considered master mis en scene succumbs hiding lack research screenplay material behind touch go montage squeezing whole story michelles training loosely based anne sullivans struggle teach communication blind deaf helen keller which is later going develop into second plot point film michelles world remains relatively unexplored throughout film but melodramatic purposes there are infinite references title dialogue but we never understand how is black different green or scarlet or turquoise completely deaf blind girl when she is not even aware existence other colours make comparative statement like that there wasnt single reference her training colour references or rhythm recognition again something that gets hidden under ravi chandrans immaculate chiaroscuro each frame chandrans could be printed as work art but his cinematography was largely incoherent with narrative id flatter it say that me it reached conrad hall levels but failed show me either michelles or debrajs world stayed confused between two like narrative itself art director omung kumar successfully creates eastern europe north india but leads chandran incoherency with story robert frosts stopping by woods snowy evening has been used walls sign linguists house where one expects see dictionary homespun signs words inscribed walls mcnallys anglo indian house looks like museum where shernaz patel gives tiresome performance as postcard hindi dialogue film belongs story like devdas english dialogue belongs class 5 balbharati textbook semi final blow comes when director bhansali rips off scene his own film khamoshee emotionally pulsating climax khamoshee where nanas character gives thank you speech sign language becomes tearjerker pre climax black with rani swapping places with nana shernaz with manisha climax again is brilliant you are just about say good at least caught one out many juggled balls when comes final blow d nouement yet another mumbled painting now some great scenes quickly first hospital scene where bacchan is walking one direction rani other enlightenment scene where bacchan throws rani water party scene where rani lip reads singer campus bench scene where rani teases bacchan about snowfall she predicted not giving him umbrella kiss scene only melodramatic scene this list climax water first swades then black indeed it is great phase indian cinema phase transition,0.5421886446886447,0.01731684981684982,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
4.0,Black-experiment for the sake of it,"Mind you, Black is not a bad film but an above average film and several notches above those run of the mill films, you get to see these days. Let me admit I am a big fan of Mr. Bhansali ever since his 1942-a love story(1994) days where he was a song director. Three cheers to him for achieving a rare status where audience hooked to director's name throng theatres. Though I wish they should have come more because of film making craft rather than marketing gimmicks in this case. A great ace here is that of not following a tried and tested formula but by choosing an amazing subject of a deaf and blind girl who is tutored by an eccentric tutor to make her realize life and to enable her to connect to real world. It does not have any art house cinema look or feel, thanks to a big budget (though does it really needed, to tell a simple story is debatable?) The camera work creates beautiful landscape portraits with the use of soft blue shade and by giving ethereal effect, in all a visual treat to watch for but can be digested only for few minutes. The performances of both lead actors especially Rani Mukherji moves you in some scenes, as their interpretation is heartening. A Great effort requiring lot of guts and a portrayal not easy to deal even by a top film-maker..But is that all a good film is about, leave apart classic? Sorry, No. Though performance of lead actors is laudable but overall they do not evoke empathy. Reason, they exist in a strange world. What purpose Rani wants to achieve by securing a graduate degree, a question hangs till the film ends. The narration of taming of a disturbed deaf and blind girl is so loud, noisy and over-expressive that it somewhere kills sensitivity that comes from being subtle. In order to show his eccentric ways Mr. Bachchan goes over the top. More screen space occupied by Shernaz Patel than Rani Mukherji. What purpose is served in the end by showing tutor Mr. Bachchan suffering from Alzheimer disease and Rani Mukerji is trying to get him back to life When the story line is so thin there should be a narrative style to take audience to a journey of exploring the unexplored dark world backed by interesting events in the script which sorry to say is lacking here and balancing act is done by overemphasizing on use of massive large, decorative sets which quite aesthetically lit by Cinematographer Ravi K. Chandran. Pookutty Resul (audiographer), Anup Dev (audio mixing) and Monty (music director) created a noisy sound track. The sets and locations give idea of a huge canvass reminding you of raj-period but what new dimension it added to the actual narration? The other characters are look-alike of half-Brits straight from raj period and half-parsis straight out from our consumer product ad films. Isn't it too much of merchant-ivorising here? What is the half-baked sub-plot of an envious sister doing? For all Characters, the period they exist in, the society they represent, the profession they carry, is vague, all in the name of universal and timeless appeal, is it? What purpose is served by having a cinema house in the background showing Chaplin's classics, can anyone tell? Mr. director stop being pretentious, self indulgent film-maker for second time. What clear statement on the whole it makes, or is it just an experiment for the sake of it ?

7.0,Bhansali overreaches and comes up short...again,"While some may applaud his effort to foray into semi-serious film-making, especially moving away from the formulaic song and dance numbers, Bhansali comes up short on delivering the story in the best way possible. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, and the symbolism, though a bit heavy-handed, is again appreciated. Bhansali manages to do a good job with his actors, but does not deliver the home run he was looking for. Reining in Rani and Amitabh would have made their performances all the more stoic, instead, giving them wild hyperactive motions, and overplaying their histrionics makes a theatergoer wonder what could have been. Black is a solid effort, but by no means the wonder and crossover of Bollywood into something more serious. Bhansali recognizes his great talents as a filmmaker, but as in Devdas, clearly plays for the awards, and makes the film a tribute to his own skill. Devdas was extravagant simply for the sake of extravagance, and while a visual treat, did not really portray the progression of the characters into the abyss, it just showed them at their best and worst points. Black does almost the same thing when it shows extraordinary moments of recognition, but it focuses much more on the dramatic, and not the subtle changes in the characters. This movie is clearly made for awards, and Bhansali does show flashes of brilliance. However, on the whole, his unwillingness to pull back from constantly hitting us with moment after moment instead of letting things build really takes away from the movie, if he truly was looking to make something different. By addressing handicaps, and Alzheimer's, and remaking a truly great film, Bhansali is playing to awards, and when a film tries too hard, as Devdas did, it inevitably falls short. The film as spectacle is great; great cinema, it is not.",bhansali overreaches comes up short again,while some may applaud his effort foray into semi serious film making especially moving away formulaic song dance numbers bhansali comes up short delivering story best way possible cinematography is absolutely beautiful symbolism though bit heavy handed is again appreciated bhansali manages do good job with his actors but does not deliver home run he was looking reining rani amitabh would have made their performances all more stoic instead giving them wild hyperactive motions overplaying their histrionics makes theatergoer wonder what could have been black is solid effort but by no means wonder crossover bollywood into something more serious bhansali recognizes his great talents as filmmaker but as devdas clearly plays awards makes film tribute his own skill devdas was extravagant simply sake extravagance while visual treat did not really portray progression characters into abyss it just showed them at their best worst points black does almost same thing when it shows extraordinary moments recognition but it focuses much more dramatic not subtle changes characters this movie is clearly made awards bhansali does show flashes brilliance however whole his unwillingness pull back constantly hitting us with moment after moment instead letting things build really takes away movie if he truly was looking make something different by addressing handicaps alzheimers remaking truly great film bhansali is playing awards when film tries too hard as devdas did it inevitably falls short film as spectacle is great great cinema it is not,0.4982683982683982,0.16193181818181818,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"
