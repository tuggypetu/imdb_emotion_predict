10,A stunning and powerful thriller,"Want to see where one of the modern era's hottest directing streaks started? If you do, then Incendies in the film for you.Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who went from this French/Canadian co-production to move onto Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival and last year's brilliant sequel Blade Runner 2049, Incendies is the Oscar nominated film that put Villeneuve on the path he finds himself on now and remains a film of substantial power these years on from initial release.Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, Incendies is a multi-layered narrative that spans both numerous countries and numerous characters over various timelines but Villeneuve controls his film perfectly as the mystery that lays at the heart of this tale about family, war, life and death never gets muddled as we're drawn further and further into a film that wraps us up in its web and refuses to let us go.There's not the abundance of filmmaking and visual flair that Villeneuve has started to become known for over his more recent Hollywood productions but Incendies power comes almost exclusively from Villeneuve's deft hand with his performers, his handling of a script that other filmmakers would struggle to bring to life and his ability to slowly ebb out more information as we go, that by the time we come to realise just what lays in store for the films characters, the power of Incendies becomes even more apparent.Saying to much about this story would be a disservice to a film that takes many various turns and pivots. Essentially at its core, a story of both twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan trying to uncover the secret of their father they've never met and find a brother they never knew they had after their Middle Eastern born mother Nawal passes away, Incendies becomes so much more than a typical family drama as it showcases time in the conflict of the Israeli and Palestinian Holy Wars, as well as the twins journey back to their country of nationality.The film in many ways showcases a different side to Villeneuve and proves the director is just as at home handling a $150 million plus Sci-Fi for a major Hollywood studio as he is behind the camera of a small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative and characters. Proof the filmmaker is a man of many talents and a director to be cherished by those that love cinema.Final Say - For any fans of Villeneuve's work, world cinema or powerful character driven dramas, then Incendies should be a film you seek out as soon as possible. Losing none of its power since its initial release, this sometimes hard to watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking and the official blasting off point for one of the modern era's great filmmakers.5 swimming pools out of 5",stunning powerful thriller,want see where one modern eras hottest directing streaks started if you do then incendies film you directed by denis villeneuve who went this french canadian co production move onto prisoners enemy sicario arrival last years brilliant sequel blade runner 2049 incendies is oscar nominated film that put villeneuve path he finds himself now remains film substantial power these years initial release adapted wajdi mouawads play same name incendies is multi layered narrative that spans both numerous countries numerous characters over various timelines but villeneuve controls his film perfectly as mystery that lays at heart this tale about family war life death never gets muddled as were drawn further further into film that wraps us up its web refuses let us go theres not abundance filmmaking visual flair that villeneuve has started become known over his more recent hollywood productions but incendies power comes almost exclusively villeneuves deft hand with his performers his handling script that other filmmakers would struggle bring life his ability slowly ebb out more information as we go that by time we come realise just what lays store films characters power incendies becomes even more apparent saying much about this story would be disservice film that takes many various turns pivots essentially at its core story both twins jeanne simon marwan trying uncover secret their father theyve never met find brother they never knew they had after their middle eastern born mother nawal passes away incendies becomes so much more than typical family drama as it showcases time conflict israeli palestinian holy wars as well as twins journey back their country nationality film many ways showcases different side villeneuve proves director is just as at home handling 150 million plus sci fi major hollywood studio as he is behind camera small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative characters proof filmmaker is man many talents director be cherished by those that love cinema final say any fans villeneuves work world cinema or powerful character driven dramas then incendies should be film you seek out as soon as possible losing none its power since its initial release this sometimes hard watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking official blasting off point one modern eras great filmmakers 5 swimming pools out 5,0.4787414965986395,0.1610908649173955,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9,Our Love Became a Funeral Pyre,"When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.Incendies already had great source material. I've praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.",our love became funeral pyre,when people watch oscars they dont usually care about best foreign film nominees incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get see those nominees at all costs incendies is kind film that one walks away feeling emotionally drained one where it stays viewers mind days end like intense personal experience it takes lot come grips with films story moving plot full twists catharsis at new directors new films festival new york at which i saw this last night denis villeneuve explained that he has made four films canada but this is first one be released america right now i see no reason why villeneuve or any actors that matter shouldnt have great future ahead them based play scorched by wajdi mouawad incendies follows non linear plot that spans two generations present day jeanne simon are twins who have lost their mother nawal nawal has stipulated her will that jeanne simon must return envelope brother they didnt know existed who is currently living fictional middle eastern country only then can twins give nawal proper burial jeanne feels obligated return letter so she goes middle east only realize some nawals nastiest secrets as jeanne uncovers more about nawal viewer is shown nawals story film builds up unforgettable ending that is sure rock any viewer incendies already had great source material ive praised plot enough but one thing i must add is that play is apparently four hours long according villeneuve its impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because i cant imagine that anything was cut but back up that source material theres some really great acting entire cast plays their parts with such emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work art wasnt autobiographical furthermore villeneuve has made film that relies great filmmaking impact viewer cinematography is beautifully bland surely nod some deserts lebanon like land where movie takes place color scheme is also used villeneuves advantage show parallels between nawal jeannes lives villeneuve seems love working with extended zoom shots that shock viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences why villeneuve didnt receive critical acclaim america at least before incendies is mystery there are many movies about middle east some have failed miserably their attempts strike emotional chord with critics viewers alike redacted rendition but others have been extremely successful hurt locker lebanon incendies could very well be one best films ever made about conflicts middle east it has its flaws which keep it being masterpiece maybe it couldve lost five or ten minutes but it is that rare type film that really resonates beyond initial viewing hopefully incendies will be remembered years come as little brilliant film that spawned great fame denis villeneuve,0.4887567905950258,0.20292605678635092,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8,One word: INCREDIBLE!,"Initially, the film can be a bit confusing due to them continually jumping back in time. Once you get the hang of it, though, and get to know the characters, it is easy enough to follow.This is essentially two films in one: the story of a mother searching for the son she had to give up at birth, and a story about twins searching for their father, and a brother they never knew they had. The film takes us on an incredible journey filled with action, suspense, drama, and more than just a few twists.'Incendies' effectively illustrates the horrors of war, and killings in the name of religion.

10,Unforgettable,"A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.A Canadain-Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son & daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. As we follow their search, flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother.There are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in Incendies. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East, this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. It is the third great film (and arguably the best)that I've seen on this topic after Waltz with Bashir and Lebanon.

9,A work of devastating power...,"""Incendies (Scorched)"" opened in town this Friday, just days before it made the short list of nominees for Best Foreign Film for this year's Academy Awards. It played in the Vancouver International Film Festival 2010, but I missed it then.Fortunately, it received theatrical distribution; this devastating film on the horrors of conflict and its enormous human costs simply must be seen. Denis Villeneuve's searing work, his fourth feature, is based on the celebrated play of the same name by Montreal native and artistic director of the French Theatre at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa Wajdi Mouawad. While there is no doubting the immediacy and impact it must have had as a piece of theatre, ""Incendies"" benefits from the transition to the larger canvas of the big screen, appropriate for the epic themes and emotional conflagrations it tackles.When their mother dies and her will is read, twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan are stumped by its bizarre burial instructions. Nawal Marwan states that she must be interred naked and facing away from the sun in an unmarked grave, until the two letters she has left with the family notary are delivered on her behalf. One is addressed to the father the twins believed dead, the second to a son whose existence comes as a complete surprise to them. The will makes the twins realize that they did not know their mother at all. They have not had an easy relationship with her, and are understandably reluctant to comply with her terms.The daughter Jeanne moved away and found refuge in the abstract realms of pure mathematics. Her sibling Simon, who remained at home, had the more complicated relationship because he dealt daily with Nawal's strangeness. Jeanne agrees to deliver the letter that was left to her, and embarks on an odyssey of discovery, in search of the father she has never known. Later, she convinces Simon to join her.Although the Middle Eastern country is never named in the film, Wajdi Mouawad ascribes the inspiration for his play to Soha Becharra, a woman who was imprisoned for six years in Khiam, southern Lebanon. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, he explained ""For me, the success of this play and the film is a way to give back some life to a woman whose life was taken away from her."" The cinematic endeavor is hugely, powerfully successful: as Jeanne scours an alien land for clues of her mother's past, we see Nawal's tough life in flashback in the same locations that her daughter visits for the first time. Sectarian strife, tribal and religious warfare, family blood feuds, and honor killings have been the blight of the Middle East and areas as far as Afghanistan and what is now Pakistan, and parts of Africa. Bloodshed and violence have been a way of life; each side claims to be justified in killing to avenge earlier injustices. While humankind has not lost its baser urges—we just have to recall the recent incident of the young Afghani woman whose nose was hacked off, or the countless rapes in present day DR Congo—the film is a plea for reconciliation and forgiveness to bring about the much needed change.Nawal barely escapes an honor killing due to her unwed pregnancy, gives up her baby son for adoption, and spends the rest of her life looking for this lost child. Along the way, she takes sides in the violence and is imprisoned for fifteen years for shooting a political leader. Upon her release, she begins life anew in Canada with her infant twins, the outcome of brutal rape at the hands of a torturer. Regardless of the change in geography, she remains haunted by the past and her unending quest for her lost child. How does one look for reparation and justice, when the perpetrators frequently flee the country of their misdeeds and seek asylum elsewhere? As she has not kept her word to her son to return to him, she feels unworthy of a proper burial. A character in the film wisely observes that death always leaves its traces, and Jeanne and Simon finally get to know their mother from the relics of her life.The Belgian actress Lubna Azabal's heroic performance brings Nawal to awe-inspiring Brechtian life. Undefeated by each dehumanizing blow, she stoically navigates a war-crazed world devoid of any sense, her driving force is the need to reunite with her son. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette do excellent work as the siblings who gradually begin to understand their mother. Rémy Girard and Allen Altman, playing the Canadian and Middle Eastern notaries respectively, guide the siblings through their search, while Abdelghafour Elaaziz makes an impact in the small but important role of Abou Tarek the torture specialist. The rest of the characters are brought to life by a talented cast of unknown actors; in their hands, even the smallest roles acquire great significance. Denis Villeneuve's film honors the stories of these people by rigorously avoiding directorial excesses. Events and stories this powerful do not require embellishment, and Villeneuve's spare, dispassionate directorial style maximizes impact.Someone remarked that ""Incendies"" is the closest contemporary approximation of Greek tragedy, and I agree with this assessment: the crimes and consequences are universal and timeless, and if a film holds up a mirror to question our capacity for barbarism, it is reason to applaud. Regardless of the outcome at the Academy Awards, ""Incendies"" is a major achievement for Canadian cinema.",work devastating power,incendies scorched opened town this friday just days before it made short list nominees best foreign film this years academy awards it played vancouver international film festival 2010 but i missed it then fortunately it received theatrical distribution this devastating film horrors conflict its enormous human costs simply must be seen denis villeneuves searing work his fourth feature is based celebrated play same name by montreal native artistic director french theatre at national arts centre ottawa wajdi mouawad while there is no doubting immediacy impact it must have had as piece theatre incendies benefits transition larger canvas big screen appropriate epic themes emotional conflagrations it tackles when their mother dies her will is read twins jeanne simon marwan are stumped by its bizarre burial instructions nawal marwan states that she must be interred naked facing away sun unmarked grave until two letters she has left with family notary are delivered her behalf one is addressed father twins believed dead second son whose existence comes as complete surprise them will makes twins realize that they did not know their mother at all they have not had easy relationship with her are understandably reluctant comply with her terms daughter jeanne moved away found refuge abstract realms pure mathematics her sibling simon who remained at home had more complicated relationship because he dealt daily with nawals strangeness jeanne agrees deliver letter that was left her embarks odyssey discovery search father she has never known later she convinces simon join her although middle eastern country is never named film wajdi mouawad ascribes inspiration his play soha becharra woman who was imprisoned six years khiam southern lebanon interview with montreal gazette he explained me success this play film is way give back some life woman whose life was taken away her cinematic endeavor is hugely powerfully successful as jeanne scours alien land clues her mothers past we see nawals tough life flashback same locations that her daughter visits first time sectarian strife tribal religious warfare family blood feuds honor killings have been blight middle east areas as far as afghanistan what is now pakistan parts africa bloodshed violence have been way life each side claims be justified killing avenge earlier injustices while humankind has not lost its baser urges we just have recall recent incident young afghani woman whose nose was hacked off or countless rapes present day dr congo film is plea reconciliation forgiveness bring about much needed change nawal barely escapes honor killing due her unwed pregnancy gives up her baby son adoption spends rest her life looking this lost child along way she takes sides violence is imprisoned fifteen years shooting political leader upon her release she begins life anew canada with her infant twins outcome brutal rape at hands torturer regardless change geography she remains haunted by past her unending quest her lost child how does one look reparation justice when perpetrators frequently flee country their misdeeds seek asylum elsewhere as she has not kept her word her son return him she feels unworthy proper burial character film wisely observes that death always leaves its traces jeanne simon finally get know their mother relics her life belgian actress lubna azabals heroic performance brings nawal awe inspiring brechtian life undefeated by each dehumanizing blow she stoically navigates war crazed world devoid any sense her driving force is need reunite with her son m lissa d sormeaux poulin maxim gaudette do excellent work as siblings who gradually begin understand their mother r my girard allen altman playing canadian middle eastern notaries respectively guide siblings through their search while abdelghafour elaaziz makes impact small but important role abou tarek torture specialist rest characters are brought life by talented cast unknown actors their hands even smallest roles acquire great significance denis villeneuves film honors stories these people by rigorously avoiding directorial excesses events stories this powerful do not require embellishment villeneuves spare dispassionate directorial style maximizes impact someone remarked that incendies is closest contemporary approximation greek tragedy i agree with this assessment crimes consequences are universal timeless if film holds up mirror question our capacity barbarism it is reason applaud regardless outcome at academy awards incendies is major achievement canadian cinema,0.4151087595532039,0.08020037233000196,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10,A Nutshell Review: Incendies,"The film begins in sweeping slow motion, centered around a harsh cemented premises with a bunch of boys undergoing the shaving of their hair ala military fashion, with the camera centered on one boy possessing this crazed looking eyes, before cutting to Canada where twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette respectively) arrive at a notary's office to accept the will of their recently deceased mother Nawal (Lubna Azabal), where they are left with letters to deliver to a father and brother that they do not know. In the meantime, they are to bury their mother in a certain strange way until their quest has been completed, with the notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard), Nawal's boss the last few years, ensuring that her last will and testament is completed the way it was intended.Incendies, based upon the play Scorched written by Wajdi Mouawad and adapted for the screen by director Denis Villeneuve, was this year's Best Foreign Language Film nominee from Canada, and there's every reason why it was a nomination well deserved. Set against a mystery to be unraveled so slowly, bringing together seemingly disparate events together in shocking fashion by the time we're through, the narrative is split into two different timelines, with the current one being the twins' journey to an unnamed Middle Eastern country in search for clues to their unknown father and brother, while with each milestone achieved of sorts, we get to see a flashback to the time of their mother, brought up in a harsh environment involving the staining of family honour, as well as religious zealots and militants who set her off in a tale of an avenging angel, and sacrifice.And the story sprawls in many directions, though with Villeneuve always having an assured hand in not having this fall into melodramatic terms nor have any wasted scenes, highlighting issues that still exist to this very day involving hatred, revenge and forgiveness, but not before laying down a number of surprises that will shake you to the core especially when the mysterious equation finally gets solved – you may get a hint of what's to come, but this got handled so expertly without being verbatim, that it accentuates and compounds the myriad of complex emotions felt by all the characters involved.With sweeping cinematography that's achingly beautiful to gaze at, one of the best scenes involve the brutal, cold blooded mass murder where militants spray countless of rounds into a packed bus, culminating in that shot of a burning bus shrouded in thick black smoke against an endless sandy environment, with Nawal finally snapping into making a decision to take matters into her own hands from then on. Between the two stories, perhaps it is Nawal's painful journey that makes this compelling viewing, from having her lover forcefully and terminally separated from her by family during her teens, then her volunteering and sacrifice leading to imprisonment and ill treatment within as punishment. What she did as part of reconciliation is in part a masterstroke in inflicting inexplicable pain in return to her perpetrator, is what made this film a winner, although it will stun you into silence well after the end credits roll from the devastation the narrative left in its wake.The other half of the narrative deals with Jeanne and Simon's journey to dig through unwritten laws, and reluctance of tightly knit communities that prefer to keep the status quo and not dwell and reopen wounds inflicted from their collective shameful past, some in denial, while others happy to have seen a more favourable outcome from Nawal's hardships. It is this piecing together of the mystery like an investigative drama that makes Incendies unique, and what more, Radiohead also features in the soundtrack – strange but true, and very powerful if you ask me.Comparing the ratings between this film at M18 and Womb at R21 reveals what the censors allow and not allow when dealing with more mature themes, likely centered around the intention of its more controversial scenes. It's anyone's guess why was was given the highest rating possible, and the other one rung lower, given that both actually didn't have anything explicit, except perhaps one was used as an unintentional weapon of torture and destruction in the psychological sense, while the other was a love story gotten out of control! Still, for its strong story and excellent production values, Incendies becomes that must watch film in 2011, especially during this season of noisy summer action blockbusters that absolutely don't resonate as much as this film.

7,"The build is tense and well crafted, but the twist is more shock value than adding depth to the story","There's no doubting Villeneuve's skill in building tension and emotional stakes through his characters and shots. While it's in a very different way, like in Enemy the shocking twist ending doesn't really add to the story and feels forced. The difference is while in Enemy the ending was insane and left the meaning and plot completely up in the air, in Incendies what happened is entirely clear and just isn't that satisfying. The most cogent point Villeneuve makes in the film is how the atrocities of war can shape people and turn them into monsters. The alternation between the past and present put into focus how war can ravage a region and a family for decades and was very effective in gradually unspooling the plot threads. The performances were all very good, particularly those playing Nawal and her daughter.Now, let's talk about that twist: that Nihad, her first son, is the man who raped her while in prison and fathered the twins. Undoubtedly, it was completely unexpected. It's a pretty crazy coincidence that he was the person assigned to torture her prison and that he chooses to rape her. Putting that aside, the real problem is that it doesn't add depth or explain anything about the characters or in the plot.

Check that, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" was another film that served a solid punch to the gut that remains with you a long time. I have to credit some other reviewers for this film to identify the location of the story and place it in context of the Lebanese civil war. I might have considered it myself if I hadn't been so absorbed by the story and the intricately detailed revelations regarding Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) and her twins, son Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin). One must pay attention though, to the non-linear story telling style of director Denis Villeneuve, as well as the identity of the Christian and Muslim factions involved in war time brutality and atrocity. Apart from the principal story, the scene that will stay with you for a long time involves a Christian militia attack on a busload of Muslims attempting to flee their war torn and devastated city. A noble sacrifice on Marwan's part turns into a horror spectacle when a young child is gunned down by the militants.

9,Fantastic! Villeneuve's best film yet,"This film is extraordinary on just about every level. The script is terrific, the actors are perfect, the direction and cinematography are all you could hope for. I recommend it without hesitation.Anyone who has seen any of Villeneuve's previous work--or Andre Turpin's Zigrail--knows that these filmmakers have bodies of work that are almost without peer in contemporary cinema world-wide and are unparallelled in the history of Canadian cinema (until seeing Incendies, Maelstrom was my favourite Canadian film). Incendies does not betray that ""legacy"". You should absolutely see it.In a film as stunning as this one it's odd to single out one aspect, but I must say that Lubna Azabal's performance is among the best I've ever seen. Though I've watched a few films that she's been in in the past, she never really stood out for me. She is devastatingly good in this picture.I do hope that this film gets submitted to the AMPAS for Oscar selection as it is definitely the best film I've seen this year and a shoe-in for the foreign picture Oscar.My only complaint about the film was the use of music by Radiohead, which took me out of the film each time it played.

8,Probably the best drama of the last few years!,"I decided to watch this movie because I have read many excellent critics and because this book is used in Quebec's ""cegeps"", some kind of a post-high-school, and my girlfriend talked about it with me. Indeed, I am very happy to have seen this intense movie. It is really a great and close to perfection. Even though I have even seen one or two better films this year, this movie is at least the best drama I have seen in the last five years.This movie is absolutely convincing. It has very intense images and words and has a very slow paced and sad atmosphere. The movie begins very calm but the tension raises very fast and you really feel more and more with the tragic characters. This movie makes you cry, it makes you angry, it shocks you. Once again, it is a Quebecker movie that is cut into pieces and may mix you up a little bit in the beginning. You see scenes from the present where Jeanne and Simon are first parallely looking for the truth and trying to fulfil her last will, you see scenes from the dramatic past of her mother at different stages of her life and you also see scenes from the past of her family. The movie shows not only a couple of interesting and diversified characters (played by mostly unknown and indeed extremely talented actors), but also magnificent and intense landscapes, shocking crime and war scenes and insights of a foreign culture and the clash of the generations and ideologies in the past and the present. The movie is much diversified and very intellectual.Many people were surprised by several twists and a very intense and dramatic ending. It is true that the development the movie takes is really shocking but I have seen a few things coming and wasn't that surprised in the end, but that almost does no harm to the atmosphere and tension of the movie. The movie tells in a very philosophical way about the irony of fate, peace and war, love and hate, vengeance and forgiveness, saints and sinners. It is uneasy to watch the movie and you still think about what you have heard and seen for quite a while after the movie.Almost everything is perfect in this movie. There are two minor reasons why I don't give the best note. First of all, I was somehow able to predict some of the punches at a certain point in the movie and I have already seen more intense and shocking dramas that very even more uneasy and heavier to watch than this one, for example ""The pianist"". Second, some scenes in the beginning of the movie are not done very well by the camera man. In the scene where Jeanne is in her mathematic class and when she looks for some accessories in her room, the camera is disturbingly shaking and moving all the time but not to create an effect of uneasiness, because there are no similar scenes later in the movie during way heavier scenes. Those two scenes (that would not have been complicated to produce or film again) are just not well done and the director should have seen and corrected that before sending the final product to the festivals and cinemas. In a perfect and intense masterpiece, this little detail is really something that could harm the reputation and professionalism of the whole brilliant work. The next time, they should be more concentrated on the movie's perfection and keep their eyes open or invest the money in a good camera director instead of some war scenes.But all in all, I think that we can really talk about an extremely good movie here! It is surely worth watching it and I agree with those ones who would like to see this movie represent Canada at the Oscars.",probably best drama last few years,i decided watch this movie because i have read many excellent critics because this book is used quebecs cegeps some kind post high school my girlfriend talked about it with me indeed i am very happy have seen this intense movie it is really great close perfection even though i have even seen one or two better films this year this movie is at least best drama i have seen last five years this movie is absolutely convincing it has very intense images words has very slow paced sad atmosphere movie begins very calm but tension raises very fast you really feel more more with tragic characters this movie makes you cry it makes you angry it shocks you once again it is quebecker movie that is cut into pieces may mix you up little bit beginning you see scenes present where jeanne simon are first parallely looking truth trying fulfil her last will you see scenes dramatic past her mother at different stages her life you also see scenes past her family movie shows not only couple interesting diversified characters played by mostly unknown indeed extremely talented actors but also magnificent intense landscapes shocking crime war scenes insights foreign culture clash generations ideologies past present movie is much diversified very intellectual many people were surprised by several twists very intense dramatic ending it is true that development movie takes is really shocking but i have seen few things coming wasnt that surprised end but that almost does no harm atmosphere tension movie movie tells very philosophical way about irony fate peace war love hate vengeance forgiveness saints sinners it is uneasy watch movie you still think about what you have heard seen quite while after movie almost everything is perfect this movie there are two minor reasons why i dont give best note first all i was somehow able predict some punches at certain point movie i have already seen more intense shocking dramas that very even more uneasy heavier watch than this one example pianist second some scenes beginning movie are not done very well by camera man scene where jeanne is her mathematic class when she looks some accessories her room camera is disturbingly shaking moving all time but not create effect uneasiness because there are no similar scenes later movie during way heavier scenes those two scenes that would not have been complicated produce or film again are just not well done director should have seen corrected that before sending final product festivals cinemas perfect intense masterpiece this little detail is really something that could harm reputation professionalism whole brilliant work next time they should be more concentrated movies perfection keep their eyes open or invest money good camera director instead some war scenes but all all i think that we can really talk about extremely good movie here it is surely worth watching it i agree with those ones who would like see this movie represent canada at oscars,0.555944264069264,0.15883658008658,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"

Then, they may put a gravestone on her tomb. Simon is reluctant to respect his mother last wishes, but Jeanne decides to find her biological father and brother.She travels to the Middle East to track down the past life of her mother and she discovers who she was before moving to Canada. She feels disturbed with the revelations and asks Simon to come to the Middle East to assist her in her journey. Simon discovers who his father and his brother are and concludes that one plus one may be equal to one.""Incendies"" is an intriguing film about the journey of two twin siblings that travel to the Middle East to fulfill the last wish of their mother and end discovering the disturbing history of their family.The screenplay is very well written and discloses in parallel to the journey of Jeanne first and Simon later, the brave history of their mother in an unnamed country in the Middle East.

10,"Powerful, gripping plot with great direction and acting","Incendies (2010) is a Canadian film that was co-written and directed by Denis Villeneuve. The movie stars Lubna Azabal as Nawal Marwan, ""The Woman Who Sings."" In the opening of the film we learn that Nawal has just died, leaving some unusual instructions for her two children in her will.Then, there's a flashback, where we learn that Nawal, as a teenager, has given birth to an out-of-wedlock infant. The rest of the plot follows from those two starting points.Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin portrays Jeanne Marwan, and Maxim Gaudette portrays her twin, Simon Narwam. Désormeaux-Poulin has the larger role, and she is superb. Lubna Azabal is equally good as Nawal.The plot involves a quest journey, and the quest is achieved. However, for me the point of the movie wasn't whether or not the mystery would be solved. The point was to see that war--especially sectarian war--causes immense suffering to everyone involved.This isn't a feel-good film. Yes--we know the answers in the end. However, except for one powerful scene involving a nurse, there's no joy or happiness for anyone. That makes the movie hard to watch, but it's so powerful that it's worth watching anyway.The movie worked well on DVD. It has an incredible IMDb rating of 8.3.

5,Contrived motivations and director's political bias undermine Lebanese Civil War victim's compelling tale of survival,"Some viewers may regard the climax of 'Incendies' as the most effective part of the film, but I must wholeheartedly disagree . If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene, that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists, the passengers react confused and frightened, the bus driver is murdered, the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers, Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus, Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother, only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.With such an unforgettable iconic scene, as listed above (along with a few others, such as the 'honor killing' at the beginning of the film), why must 'Incendies' ultimately be labeled as contrived and dishonest? For starters, Villenueve only vaguely alludes to the film's main setting. We know that Nawal's journey occurs in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War but the country, along with the right wing Arab Christian party, the ""Phalangists"", are never mentioned by name. When Nawal's family members murder her lover, they refer to him as a ""refugee"" not as a ""Palestinian"". Despite stripping the events depicted in the film of their political context, Villenueve clearly cannot hide his bias. Nawal decides to become an assassin for the Muslims after her Muslim lover is murdered by her own Christian family and she's a witness to the bus massacre by Arab Christian terrorists. Only a ""kindly"" Muslim warlord (""Chamseddine"") happens to tell Narwan's son, Simon, the truth during the search for the ""son"" and the ""father"". And that truth is that the fighting is tit for tat—one reprisal begets another. Nonetheless, Villenueve still implies that it's the Muslim side who are clearly the wronged party here. By no means am I trying to defend the brutality of the right-wing nationalists during the Lebanese Civil War, but there were two sides to the story and certainly that's lost in Villenueve's narrative.As to why the film should be considered contrived, it's not so much the wacko ending which is designed to point out the horrors of war (and hence its pointlessness) but the whole idea that the mother would send her children on a wild goose chase, making them face the truth about HER situation, instead of telling them what happened on her deathbed (she was able to blurt out the main points to family friend, the Notary Lebel) or allowing Lebel to explain it to the kids without having them experience the full impact of the horror by traveling to Lebanon, dredging up old wounds amongst people who they didn't know (and didn't even speak their language). I question whether any mother would have put her children in such a position—why was she so insistent on having them learn the truth about their parentage? After all, the revelation that her son was actually her other children's father, basically drove her insane and led to her death. This from a woman who always claimed she would do anything for her children. And here they would end up in a foreign country, asking sensitive questions which could place their lives in jeopardy.While a series of chilling events, clearly molded Narwan's character, there's little character development when it comes to the son. He has that most disagreeable chip on his shoulder (until he finally bonds with his sister in the swimming pool), but for most of the film, he is an unwelcome, one-note presence. And what's with that lack of hesitation with taking a ride blind-folded with the Warlord's bodyguards? The guide's assurance that ""everything is okay"" is enough for him to take a ride with a duo of potential killers. How does he know that his guide can be so sure about the Warlord?And what about Abou Tarek (the 'son' and the 'father')? The Warlord trains him to be a crackerjack sniper but becomes disaffected by war and switches sides, ending up in the Christian Arab prison, as Narwan's torturer. Even though we hear the explanation from Chamseddine, it seems a little too convenient that Tarek so easily switches from the Muslim to the Christian Arab side with so little explanation. Of course without him doing so, there's no 'twist ending', designed to shock.I understood that the two letters which Narwan has her children deliver to Tarek reflects Narwan's ambivalence about how she feels toward him. But again, why involve the twins? How is Narwan so sure that her revelation to him that he's her son, will impact his conscience? It's already been established that he's a psychopath so I would hardly think that he would care who his mother is. For all we know, Tarek may have decided to go after the half-siblings, as they could reveal his dark secret publicly and cause him a good deal of trouble.'Incendies' manages to keep one's interest despite the main character's motivations that don't add up and the director's clear political bias.

10,Exquisite,"Denis Villeneuve has created nothing less than a masterpiece. This film is revealing a great Director, especially when given an original story with such powerful dimensions.Despite being skeptical as first of the film being shot in Jordan, when dealing with the very specific, multidimensional Lebanese drama, the geographic distance with the land of Lebanon is detaching the film from the strict reality of the place and taking it to whole other level of significance. Jordan's landscape especially with the film's photography, are somewhat surrealistic, as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region's sub-conscious.Villeneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront. And yet these things did happen, many times during the war and retelling them is a very not an easy task. Actually a quasi impossible one and yet Villeneuve did it.This has to be the film representing Canada at the Oscars.

7,"Politics aside, a great story and moving film","Im not sure the particular politics really matter much here. I think you could drop this story into any civilly torn nation at any time in history with little change. And, while the ending may be too clean for some, it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the movie. This is high praise, because given the choice, war stories are not typically high on my list of go-to viewing. This felt more like a fable or fairytale to me. I found the both the story and visuals beautiful.",politics aside great story moving film,im not sure particular politics really matter much here i think you could drop this story into any civilly torn nation at any time history with little change while ending may be too clean some it didnt take away my enjoyment movie this is high praise because given choice war stories are not typically high my list go viewing this felt more like fable or fairytale me i found both story visuals beautiful,0.5592929292929293,0.24780303030303028,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.56}"
10,Incendies,"Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.",incendies,incendies is based play by wajdi mouawad film is canadian film french arabic with english subtitles going into theatre see incendies i really knew nothing about it i had not read any reviews that came out but i had heard television news shows that it was supposed be very good now with best foreign language film oscar i assumed that it was going be really good film i decided not read anything about plot before i saw film because these days i find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information films their reviews that when you finally do see film it does not have same affect you so having known nothing about incendies then watching story unfold before my eyes was quite experience i would recommend you do same if you are at all inclined go see it other than films director denis villeneuve i was not familiar with anybody else who appeared film or worked sides but i must say that they all did fantastic job this is type film that when you are watching it you are not quite sure what will happen or how climax or ending will come but when it does it makes sense you leaves you with multitude feelings at times incendies was not always most easy film watch not because it was overly violent or graphic because i thought everything was handled very tastefully done way but it still sucks so much emotion out us we get care so much characters what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes that we can not help but feel sad enraged or even physically ill watching it at times i should clarify that film does deal with some goings with middle east wars tension prejudices that came out some those wars moments terror that people at that time still are going through i also liked how when dealing with such tricky controversial subject matter such as this that as i mentioned it was all very tastefully done none it felt like you were watching hollywood movie i think if this had been big budget big name star movie extravaganza then it probably would not have worked reason it works so well as it is is because fact that it is so character driven deals with events that have gone past some similar different ways are still going today film felt personal me it felt like people involved with film had something say instead sugar coating everything making it easily watchable film with feel good portion it it instead goes all your emotions sense almost takes you journey personal trials tribulations that characters movie have gone understandably we can almost feel their pain exhaustion hurt because performances have this sense believability authenticity them that everything we see them go through feels like real thing way they handle each situation is believable not far fetched at all characters film give us something believe because they are searching truth will go many lengths find it even if at times it is difficult or even dangerous amount honour pride they carry with them set out someones wishes is truly remarkable this is incredibly powerful film that as i mentioned does put you through array different emotions but i did not mind that because i felt i could connect with characters more because this look feel film is not big budget or fake looking which makes all interior exterior shots look real further enhancing emotions or moods we are supposed feel each scene acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well this is just really well put together film with great cast director wonderful material work mold into this brave haunting yet life changing experience i have not seen any other best foreign language film oscar nominees but having just seen incendies now i would say that it has good chance winning because how masterful great it is do not just take my word it go see it when it opens theatre near you this is certainly one best films 2010,0.5357791191594009,0.2005181086519115,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"

6,A touching film that depends on coincidences all the way up to ridiculous,"I have written this review as a response to all those who find in this film a perfect jewel and label it as underrated (although in many sites it is highly rated and has more than 100,000 views). It is true that it is a very entertaining and interesting film, and I think that, for many viewers, the obvious weaknesses of the film are not so obvious. Something that I liked and called attention to is the narrative structure. Some twins (female and male) find out from their mother's will that they have a brother and that their father is alive. The mother commands them to find them both. During the first part of the film, only the daughter decides to carry out her mother's wishes, and to do so she travels to a Middle Eastern country (which is never specified) where, as she travels through places that played an important role in her mother's life, we are presented with her biography through flashbacks. It is easy to feel confused at first with the factions (Christian and Muslim), because they do not correspond to a historical reality, but rather were made in the service of fiction. However, little by little, the viewer is able to put the puzzle back together and discover the hard life that the woman led in the midst of violence and intolerance. The film has a lot of plot-twists that manage to arouse the interest of their audience and, to a certain extent, are presented in such a way that it is possible to glimpse them when they approach. Unfortunately, the film depends too much on coincidences of sudden and unexplained developments. About this, in many occasions I found elements that, although they should seem natural, were not very well explained and, of course, for the final outcome to happen the scriptwriters took the coincidences to the last consequences. Although Nawal Marwan seems to live in a rural environment, she is able to move to a relative who works at a university. Despite the fact that at first she cannot read or write (at around 21 years of age), she soon manages to work at a newspaper writing articles. The screenwriters made Marwan a prodigious mind: even though she began receiving education as an adult, within a few years she is able to infiltrate as a tutor to the son of an extremist Christian leader she was tasked to kill, teaching him French and English. After killing this leader, she is finally captured and taken to a prison where she is tortured for no less than 15 years. After being raped by one of her captors and becoming pregnant, she is released (instead of executed) and, with the help of the warlord who benefited from the Christian leader's death, she's exiled to Canada. The same pattern is repeated in the son's story. He is left in an orphanage where, ultimately, is recruited by an extremist Muslim group. There he is trained as a militia officer, a sniper. He is not just any sniper, of course, he is the most skilled and recognized of all. Eventually, the enemy faction, the Christians, manage to capture him, but, because of his ability, they decide not to execute him but to recruit him themselves (wasn't it supposed to be a holy war?) and, moreover, they do not train him as a sniper (there is no justification for it), but as a torturer. In his new job he ends up working in the prison where, by chance, his mother is. He unknowingly rapes her, she gets her pregnant and thus he becomes the twins' father and brother at the same time. This is shocking and, I admit, makes one reflect on the way in which war separates people who, in peace, would live together happily. It is a sad and painful story, incisive and critical of the senselessness of war, but it is weakened by its dependence on so many unjustified elements. And, without a doubt, what put me most against the film was how the mother came to know that the one who raped her was her own son. In a swimming pool, the woman sees a man who, on his foot, has the tattoo with which she marked her son to identify him. Then, upon discovering his face, she is horrified that her son is the father of the twins, the rapist. The pain of the scene is diluted by the coincidences: her son emigrated from the country where he was originally and precisely that country is Canada and, besides, she finds him in a pool, where she can see his foot and recognize the mark. Finally, the son is unable to recognize her as his victim, so the man does not run away, fearing that he will be denounced for his past crimes. By leaving her will, the mother entrusts her children with the torturous task of discovering that they are their own brother's children, a task that would be impossible were it not for the fact that they are ""lucky"" enough to correlate the records and find the people who could lead them to the truth. Although I have vilified the film, in reality it is a very beautiful film visually, with an impeccable performance and a catchy plot, but it depends on coincidences that become ridiculous and take it away from a perfect rating.",touching film that depends coincidences all way up ridiculous,i have written this review as response all those who find this film perfect jewel label it as underrated although many sites it is highly rated has more than 100 000 views it is true that it is very entertaining interesting film i think that many viewers obvious weaknesses film are not so obvious something that i liked called attention is narrative structure some twins female male find out their mothers will that they have brother that their father is alive mother commands them find them both during first part film only daughter decides carry out her mothers wishes do so she travels middle eastern country which is never specified where as she travels through places that played important role her mothers life we are presented with her biography through flashbacks it is easy feel confused at first with factions christian muslim because they do not correspond historical reality but rather were made service fiction however little by little viewer is able put puzzle back together discover hard life that woman led midst violence intolerance film has lot plot twists that manage arouse interest their audience certain extent are presented such way that it is possible glimpse them when they approach unfortunately film depends too much coincidences sudden unexplained developments about this many occasions i found elements that although they should seem natural were not very well explained course final outcome happen scriptwriters took coincidences last consequences although nawal marwan seems live rural environment she is able move relative who works at university despite fact that at first she cannot read or write at around 21 years age she soon manages work at newspaper writing articles screenwriters made marwan prodigious mind even though she began receiving education as adult within few years she is able infiltrate as tutor son extremist christian leader she was tasked kill teaching him french english after killing this leader she is finally captured taken prison where she is tortured no less than 15 years after being raped by one her captors becoming pregnant she is released instead executed with help warlord who benefited christian leaders death shes exiled canada same pattern is repeated sons story he is left orphanage where ultimately is recruited by extremist muslim group there he is trained as militia officer sniper he is not just any sniper course he is most skilled recognized all eventually enemy faction christians manage capture him but because his ability they decide not execute him but recruit him themselves wasnt it supposed be holy war moreover they do not train him as sniper there is no justification it but as torturer his new job he ends up working prison where by chance his mother is he unknowingly rapes her she gets her pregnant thus he becomes twins father brother at same time this is shocking i admit makes one reflect way which war separates people who peace would live together happily it is sad painful story incisive critical senselessness war but it is weakened by its dependence so many unjustified elements without doubt what put me most against film was how mother came know that one who raped her was her own son swimming pool woman sees man who his foot has tattoo with which she marked her son identify him then upon discovering his face she is horrified that her son is father twins rapist pain scene is diluted by coincidences her son emigrated country where he was originally precisely that country is canada besides she finds him pool where she can see his foot recognize mark finally son is unable recognize her as his victim so man does not run away fearing that he will be denounced his past crimes by leaving her will mother entrusts her children with torturous task discovering that they are their own brothers children task that would be impossible were it not fact that they are lucky enough correlate records find people who could lead them truth although i have vilified film reality it is very beautiful film visually with impeccable performance catchy plot but it depends coincidences that become ridiculous take it away perfect rating,0.5175203074079477,0.13118026168587965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9,A promise is very much a sacred thing,"The main attraction into seeing 'Incendies' was that it was directed by Denis Villeneuve, having loved 'Sicario' and really liked 'Prisoners' (apart from the ending). Reviews for both films recommended 'Incendies' highly and with people calling it one of Villeneuve's best, so seeing the film was definitely on the cards.Seeing it, 'Incendies' turned out to be every bit the great film as touted. Although more needs to be seen from Villeneuve, 'Incendies' to me does contain some of his best work seen thus far and my second favourite after 'Sicario'. It is a tough watch, often incredibly hard-hitting, and will have things that people will love and others won't (some will, and have done, find it contrived and melodramatic), but again to me 'Incendies' was so exceptionally well made all round with such a strong emotional impact throughout that although it is not perfect it was hard not to be hard on it.'Incendies's' weak point is the ending, it is certainly unexpected and has some power but also seemed rather contrived and like it went on far with the number of coincidences, almost as credibility-straining as the ending of 'Prisoners' if not quite.However, 'Incendies' is superbly made visually, especially in the stylish and brooding cinematography, with deft use of close-ups and long shots, that captures the horrors of the story wonderfully, even if Roger Deakins did it just a little bit better. The scenery is similarly audacious while also highly atmospheric. The music is suitably haunting, with great use of Radiohead's ""You and Whose Army"".Villeneuve's direction is some of his career's best, he specialised in giving his films a darkness that was beautiful and brutal but also a hard edge that didn't hold back for the better. That can be seen in 'Incendies'. While not as tight as the script in 'Sicario', the script has a lot of emotional impact and provokes thought.When it comes to the story, 'Incendies' is also hugely successful. It really hits hard without overdoing or sugar-coating things, it's very much authentic, and is also very moving. The bus massacre in particular is a highlight that shocks one to the core. The parallel split-time structure of the story is very interesting, neither story line is hard to follow and they tie up neatly at the end, while the numerous revelations and twists could have been credibility-straining and illogical if not done right but Villeneuve keeps it all under control. Anguish, confusion and regret has not in a while been seen by me so poignantly on film.Performances are strong across the board, with powerhouse turns from Lubna Azabal and Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin. The film does a particularly great job in creating sympathy for the protagonist, who is developed beautifully, one where she is easy to root for every step of the way and comes over as a compellingly real one.Overall, great film, a near-masterwork though the ending is not as good as the rest of the film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",promise is very much sacred thing,main attraction into seeing incendies was that it was directed by denis villeneuve having loved sicario really liked prisoners apart ending reviews both films recommended incendies highly with people calling it one villeneuves best so seeing film was definitely cards seeing it incendies turned out be every bit great film as touted although more needs be seen villeneuve incendies me does contain some his best work seen thus far my second favourite after sicario it is tough watch often incredibly hard hitting will have things that people will love others wont some will have done find it contrived melodramatic but again me incendies was so exceptionally well made all round with such strong emotional impact throughout that although it is not perfect it was hard not be hard it incendiess weak point is ending it is certainly unexpected has some power but also seemed rather contrived like it went far with number coincidences almost as credibility straining as ending prisoners if not quite however incendies is superbly made visually especially stylish brooding cinematography with deft use close ups long shots that captures horrors story wonderfully even if roger deakins did it just little bit better scenery is similarly audacious while also highly atmospheric music is suitably haunting with great use radioheads you whose army villeneuves direction is some his careers best he specialised giving his films darkness that was beautiful brutal but also hard edge that didnt hold back better that can be seen incendies while not as tight as script sicario script has lot emotional impact provokes thought when it comes story incendies is also hugely successful it really hits hard without overdoing or sugar coating things its very much authentic is also very moving bus massacre particular is highlight that shocks one core parallel split time structure story is very interesting neither story line is hard follow they tie up neatly at end while numerous revelations twists could have been credibility straining illogical if not done right but villeneuve keeps it all under control anguish confusion regret has not while been seen by me so poignantly film performances are strong across board with powerhouse turns lubna azabal m lissa d sormeaux poulin film does particularly great job creating sympathy protagonist who is developed beautifully one where she is easy root every step way comes over as compellingly real one overall great film near masterwork though ending is not as good as rest film 9 10 bethany cox,0.5869047619047617,0.23986599953991258,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.29}"
