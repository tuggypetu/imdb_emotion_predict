10.0,"Lady and the Tramp, before animation and at the start of talkies- one of the most wonderful films ever conceived and executed","If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend, as others have pointed to in the past, City Lights is the one. Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies, like Modern Times and The Gold Rush, City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest, his bravest, his most romantic, and his most sympathetic. It's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters, but it's pulled off. The film centers on three characters- the Tramp, the quintessential, funny homeless man who blends into the crowd, but gets caught in predicaments. He helps a drunken businessman (Myers, a fine performance in his own right) from suicide, and becomes his on and off again friend (that is, when it suits him and doesn't notice his 'friend's' state). The other person in the Tramp's life is the Blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill, one of the most absorbing, beautiful, and key female performances in silent film), who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception. The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money, which leads to a (how else can I put it) magical boxing match where it's basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull. Though there is no dialog, the film achieves a timelessness- it's essentially a tale of two loners who find each other, lose each other, and find each other again (the last scene, widely discussed by critics for decades, is moving if not tear-inducing). And it's never, ever boring- once you get along with the Tramp, you find the little things about him, the reaction shots, the little things he does after the usual big gag (look to the ballroom scene for examples of this, or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing). Truth be told, if this film makes you indifferent, never watch Chaplin again. But if you give yourself to the film, you may find it's one of the most charming from the era, or perhaps any era.",lady tramp before animation at start talkies one most wonderful films ever conceived executed,if there is one charlie chaplin film recommend as others have pointed past city lights is one though chaplin played his tramp character superbly other movies like modern times gold rush city lights displays tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic his most sympathetic its tough filmmakers recent days bring audience so close emotionally with characters but its pulled off film centers three characters tramp quintessential funny homeless man who blends into crowd but gets caught predicaments he helps drunken businessman myers fine performance his own right suicide becomes his off again friend that is when it suits him doesnt notice his friends state other person tramps life is blind flower girl virginia cherrill one most absorbing beautiful key female performances silent film who are quite fond each other despite lack total perception emotional centerpiece comes obtaining rent eye surgery money which leads how else can i put it magical boxing match where its basically 180 brutality viscerality match say raging bull though there is no dialog film achieves timelessness its essentially tale two loners who find each other lose each other find each other again last scene widely discussed by critics decades is moving if not tear inducing its never ever boring once you get along with tramp you find little things about him reaction shots little things he does after usual big gag look ballroom scene examples this or when he gets bottle wine poured down his pants without other guy noticing truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch chaplin again but if you give yourself film you may find its one most charming era or perhaps any era,0.5496031746031745,0.09553340716131413,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,Chaplin's Classic of Humor and Humanity,"Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it. Although made very much in the old-fashioned silent film tradition, much of it is timeless, too.After a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning, Charlie's ""little tramp"" character makes two acquaintances. He meets a blind girl selling flowers, who mistakes him for a rich man, and the two become very fond of each other. Then he meets a real millionaire, who is drunk, depressed, and about to commit suicide. In a comic scene, the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it, making himself a devoted friend.The tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight, and tries to think of some way he could help. His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving, while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades - his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny, and one of Chaplin's best comic pieces. Meanwhile, when his millionaire friend is drunk, he dotes on the tramp, but when sober he forgets who the tramp is, leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for Charlie.All of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the best-remembered scenes in any film. ""City Lights"" shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master, who without words can move his audience or make them laugh. Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once.",chaplins classic humor humanity,charlie chaplins city lights contains blend humor humanity that make it memorable everyone who watches it although made very much old fashioned silent film tradition much it is timeless too after few minutes slapstick at beginning charlies little tramp character makes two acquaintances he meets blind girl selling flowers who mistakes him rich man two become very fond each other then he meets real millionaire who is drunk depressed about commit suicide comic scene tramp persuades millionaire not go through with it making himself devoted friend tramp soon learns that there is operation that could give girl her sight tries think some way he could help his scenes with girl her grandmother are moving while his determination help lead him into some comic escapades his attempt win money boxing match being particularly funny one chaplins best comic pieces meanwhile when his millionaire friend is drunk he dotes tramp but when sober he forgets who tramp is leading more amusing scenes occasional trouble charlie all comedy leads up finale that is one best remembered scenes any film city lights shows power camera hands master who without words can move his audience or make them laugh anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once,0.4561111111111111,0.17097222222222225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.16}"
10.0,Chaplin's Masterpiece...and Oh Those Last Five Minutes!,"Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" a masterpiece. It's only 81 minutes long, but they are among the best 81 minutes you could spend at the movies, and the last five minutes are simply exquisite. Keep your Kleenex box at arm's length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film. When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says ""Yes, I can see now"", the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanation.Chaplin was at his zenith in 1928 when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story, and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade. He had already made the classics ""The Gold Rush"" (1925) and ""The Circus"" (1928) starring his character, so it's obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time. The advent of talkies didn't stop Chaplin from making this ""Comedy Romance in Pantomime"" (as he subtitled it), as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character. What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a well-mannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down, even going to prison for love. It is this self-delusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl, played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill. Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film, as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable. Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale, Chaplin's leading lady in ""The Gold Rush"" and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill, as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the ""wealthy"" gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sight.Of course, this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes - the rising and lowering of the street elevator, the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub, the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene, which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers (and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra, inspired by an earlier Chaplin short ""The Champion"" from 1915). Even a simple moment, for example, when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine, is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment. And special mention needs to go to Chaplin's musical score, where he beautifully interweaves José Padilla's ""La Violetta"" as his love theme.The transfer to DVD is very good, and the 2-DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality. The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film, and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the long-forgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then. The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long. The 10-minute home movie of Chaplin's trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise. Regardless, the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplin's reputation as one of the world's leading filmmakers.",chaplins masterpiece oh those last five minutes,let me join consensus call charlie chaplins city lights masterpiece its only 81 minutes long but they are among best 81 minutes you could spend at movies last five minutes are simply exquisite keep your kleenex box at arms length as i doubt if there has been more honestly heartbreaking scene captured film when formerly blind girl gives little tramp flower ultimately says yes i can see now scene takes such emotional gravity as defy explanation chaplin was at his zenith 1928 when he started journey more than two years develop film this story little tramp had already been familiar character audiences over decade he had already made classics gold rush 1925 circus 1928 starring his character so its obvious he felt need take slightly different direction deepen character this time advent talkies didnt stop chaplin making this comedy romance pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving little tramp voice would limit his appeal as universal character what i particularly enjoyed this film is how little tramp fancies himself as well mannered gentleman spite all circumstances that bring him down even going prison love it is this self delusion his subsequent mistaken identity as millionaire that leads him blind flower girl played effectively plaintive manner by virginia cherrill her performance is greatly underrated element this film as she displays right amount vacant innocence make last minutes so memorable simply compare her screen test shown georgia hale chaplins leading lady gold rush obviously more experienced actress than cherrill as hale struggles show right balance between condescension beatific revelation when she realizes little tramp is wealthy gentleman who paid restoration her sight course this would not be chaplin film without brilliance his comedy routines there is treasure trove classic scenes rising lowering street elevator shifting musical chairs scene at nightclub mock suicide at canal especially boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers was according footage included as dvd extra inspired by earlier chaplin short champion 1915 even simple moment example when little tramp mistakes piece thread his vest ball twine is impressive sheer delicacy moment special mention needs go chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves jos padillas la violetta as his love theme transfer dvd is very good 2 dvd set has plenty extras though they vary quality serge bromberg documentary provides informative supplement film footage chaplin vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures long forgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then aforementioned georgia hale screen test is worthwhile addition but runs bit too long 10 minute home movie chaplins trip bali has certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise regardless movie itself is rewarding enough exquisite jewel that completely justifies chaplins reputation as one worlds leading filmmakers,0.5245889599620943,0.20692489931295896,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"You can't go wrong with Charlie Chaplin, but City Lights is even better than Chaplin's films usually are.","Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights, and the results are spectacular. The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights, and even though Charlie's performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes, the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant. City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked. Yes, you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene, but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really don't matter. Besides, let's keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago. Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp, and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk. His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious, but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol. This is truly a great film, which should not be forgotten.",you cant go wrong with charlie chaplin but city lights is even better than chaplins films usually are,chaplin takes himself little more seriously city lights results are spectacular musical score which chaplin composed film was one many highlights even though charlies performance is much more dramatic than usual some scenes hilarious comedy which he is known loved is still abundant city lights is so well made that it is one very few movies which obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked yes you can clearly see string holding chaplin up sidesplittingly funny boxing scene but who cares that is such classic slapstick that little things like that really dont matter besides lets keep mind that this movie was made seventy years ago chaplin does phenomenal job his traditional role tramp develops perfectly convincing romantic relationship with blind flower girl sidewalk his friendship with drunken rich guy is hilarious but it also makes significant comment about problems alcohol this is truly great film which should not be forgotten,0.6057070707070707,0.17469696969696968,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,One Of Chaplin''s Best & Most Endearing Films,"I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin's nicest, most under-appreciated silent movie gems. Then I discovered it really wasn't underrated; it's rated very high on most critics' lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.Part of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I'm a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It's a romance between Charlie's tramp character (no name) and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which I found very attractive.I'm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton, but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as ""talkies"" were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and I particularly laughed (I love slapstick) at the boxing scene. Kudos, too, to Harry Myers as the ""eccentric millionaire.""There's a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86-minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.Comedy, romance, drama (with suffering) all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment.

10.0,"""Tomorrow the birds will sing""","The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one. The first full-length talkies were released in 1928. By 1929 theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business. By 1930 silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism. But in 1931 a new silent picture was released that, far from being an embarrassing failure, became the fourth-highest grossing picture of the year, being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy. The picture was City Lights and its producer, writer, director, editor, composer and star was Mr Charlie Chaplin.Chaplin was of course primarily a comedian, and his humour was of broad appeal, but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy. The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front, and the ever-popular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound. What makes Charlie stand out, and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era, is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary, empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy. Of all Chaplin's silent pictures, City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes. The number of classic gags here is fairly small. Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence. City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance, but it's a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter. Within this story, the comedy becomes functional, often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone. Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights real.As if to snub the talkie, City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative, even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedy-driven moments. Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated, which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card. Out of necessity Chaplin's technical approach is more overt than his usual. He often cuts to a close-up to give us a necessary reaction, and there are even some whip-pans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet, but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture. Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment, and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvre.But what really makes City Lights work, what makes it connect, is the man himself on the screen. Those additional close-ups, once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body, now show off a capability for intense facial acting. An older, more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive, but his own career trajectory was entering new ground, where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal. The result is profoundly moving.",tomorrow birds will sing,victory sound picture over silent was speedy decisive one first full length talkies were released 1928 by 1929 theatres were being forced convert sound order stay business by 1930 silent film production by major studios was completely discontinued medium became generally viewed as anachronism but 1931 new silent picture was released that far being embarrassing failure became fourth highest grossing picture year being even more popular than such classics as bela lugosi dracula public enemy picture was city lights its producer writer director editor composer star was mr charlie chaplin chaplin was course primarily comedian his humour was broad appeal but audiences time were not exactly starved easy comedy marx brothers were making great strides verbal quipping front ever popular laurel hardy had made successful transition sound what makes charlie stand out what gave him level accessibility that allowed him continue with his slapstick antics well into sound era is his equal devotion story which allowed him scope social commentary empathetic characterisation deep poignancy all chaplins silent pictures city lights is probably his least memorable funny stakes number classic gags here is fairly small not since kid decade earlier has chaplin given story so much precedence city lights is riddled with coincidence plot contrivance but its tale such beauty sincerity that this does not matter within this story comedy becomes functional often serving puncture schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone ironically it is occasional forays into slapstick that help keep city lights real as if snub talkie city lights is remarkable achievement complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards then often only as embellishment more comedy driven moments most plot points character traits are implied rather than stated which gives picture continual smoothness another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad see back intrusive title card out necessity chaplins technical approach is more overt than his usual he often cuts close up give us necessary reaction there are even some whip pans scene where he flower girl first meet but all this is keeping with rhythm tone picture those whip pans after all reflect abrupt emotional moment are no way blatant or showy manoeuvre but what really makes city lights work what makes it connect is man himself screen those additional close ups once rarity man who acted mainly with his body now show off capability intense facial acting older more meditative chaplin may have been keeping traditions silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate personal result is profoundly moving,0.45759403242955865,0.14309875066454011,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,Masterpiece,"City Lights (1931) **** (out of 4)Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) and sets out to help her. The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk (Harry Myers) and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he loves.Chaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made. Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but I'd also argue that it's one of the greatest love stories, if not the greatest. It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever made.I think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and there's really not a weak spot to be found here. Being 1931 it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound. He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point. The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point. The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success. The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water. In fact, the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own. Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film. What's so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really delivers.Chaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here. Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you can't help but be impressed with the actor. Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together. Then you've got Cherrill who wasn't a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughout.CITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history.

,Wonderful set-pieces make the film,"As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside. While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot. However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enough.In response to seeing some modern trash posing as ""comedies"" recently (Little Man, Norbit, Pluto Nash  I'm looking at you) I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them. City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not. I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start. As was often the case, this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic. And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole film.The statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring. Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at. His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good. Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character, while Myers, Garcia, Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside Chaplin.City Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made. The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent set-pieces that tickle and also stick in the mind. So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead.",wonderful set pieces make film,as always little tramp is fleeing long arm law when he is mistaken wealthy man by blind girl selling flowers by roadside while he longs help her tramp knows he cannot however when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon drunken man who he helps out who may be able help him turn if two them can sober up long enough response seeing some modern trash posing as comedies recently little man norbit pluto nash im looking at you i decided check out some comedies that have stood test time few chaplin films being among them city lights is one those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not i knew i had never actually seen it but wonderful opening scene statue scenario blind girl by side road were very familiar me i was right into it start as was often case this film has thin narrative but one that allows several scenarios chaplin work his magic so he does with some classic sequences across whole film statue scene is memorable how he makes so much out so little but brilliant choreography boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully imaginatively around ring chaplin is master this is just one many films that shows it as he creates great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at his support do no more than that support him but yet they are also roundly good cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while myers garcia mann few others do good physical work alongside chaplin city lights is really great film that is all more impressive still feeling fresh funny more than seventy years after it was made simple narrative is frame but it is wonderful frequent set pieces that tickle also stick mind so tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic top list instead,0.5310690943043885,0.2677754435107376,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,Amusing comedy sets up SPECTACULAR ending,"This is my favorite Chaplin film, but I don't want that to diminish his other work, either. MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn't make a bad movie, and I'm not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.That ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it's a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin's little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It's a monument to understated sentimentality.To me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid.

10.0,True Blind Love,"CITY LIGHTS (United Artists, 1931), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin (1889- l977), is a silent comedy-drama released at the height of the sound era. Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad, Chaplin gambled with this production, and made it pay off. Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH (1925) as the one movie he would most want to be remembered, CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time, practically places his other silent masterpiece, THE CIRCUS (1928) to oblivion. CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time, balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama, but in Chaplin's case, pathos.Subtitled, ""A comedy romance in pantomime,"" the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city. After the unveiling, the crowd finds a little tramp (Charlie Chaplin) sleeping on the lap of one of the figures. As he tries to climb down, he encounters one problem after another. This opening scene alone is priceless. With such a great beginning, Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot. The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramp's love for a blind girl. However, there is a subplot, involving the tramp's involvement with a millionaire drunk, which, by far, takes up more time than the sentimental love story. These two segments actually set the pattern. First segment, set in the afternoon, finds Charlie walking down the street, examining a nude statue in a shop, being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing. He encounters a beautiful blonde girl (Virginia Cherrill) selling flowers. After she drops one of her flowers, Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it, thus, realizing she's blind. Smitten by her beauty, he picks it up and pays her for it. Minutes later, the slamming of a limousine door is heard, with the girl believing the kind gentleman, Charlie, to be a millionaire. Second segment, set at night, finds Charlie encountering a drunk (Harry Myers) trying to commit suicide by drowning himself. Just as Charlie is about to save him, he in turn falls into the river. The drunk, in gratitude for saving his life, takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn. By morning, the millionaire, now sober, fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion. This running gag that's repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious, but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges. By day, Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when she's not at her usual corner selling flowers. Finding that she's ill and being cared by her grandmother (Florence Lee), whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction, Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs, ranging from street-cleaning to fighting in a boxing match. Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind, Charlie gives the girl $1,000 for an operation, the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire, who, after sober, accuses Charlie of robbing him, has his arrested and serving jail time. The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missed.Featured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman, Allan Garcia, Albert Austin, and Hank Mann. While much has been discussed about Chaplin's performance, his co-star, Virginia Cherrill, as the blind girl (no name given), should not go without mention. Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers, and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor, Cary Grant, her performance is excellent by all means. Although it's been said that future film star Jean Harlow (1911-1937) appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence, she is visible in a surviving still photograph, but no such scene appears in the finished product. Unlike THE GOLD RUSH, CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years, and was never allowed to be distributed to television. Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York City's revival movie house, The Regency Theater, formerly located on Broadway and 67th Street, in 1979, the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience. There was one man, probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories, whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film. No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else. Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy, and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in 1931.After Chaplin's death in December of 1977, CITY LIGHTS, along with his other silent features, were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure, but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplin's 100th birthday, 1989. In later years, CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels, ranging from Turner Network Television (TNT) in the early 1990s, American Movie Classics up to 2001, and finally Turner Classic Movies. The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself. Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years. To learn more about the making, difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS, either watch Kevin Blownlow's 1980 documentary, Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film, as narrated by James Mason, or Brownlow's other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplin's career, including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrill's temporary replacement, Georgia Hale, Chaplin's co-star in THE GOLD RUSH.

10.0,The Zen-Like Little Tramp,"Waddling along with his cane and derby hat, and that tiny mustache, the little tramp (Charles Chaplin) is visually unlike any character in film history. The tramp is kind-hearted, always dignified. He's a simple soul who in ""City Lights"" tries to help out a young blind woman (well played by Virginia Cherrill). This is a silent film, of course, but the tramp's body language is his speech.The really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life. He's more or less ignored by many, laughed at by others. The girl's grandmother never ""sees"" him at all. And only when the millionaire is drunk does he ""see"" the tramp as a friend. Curious ... and deep.The tramp gets into his fair share of trouble, but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl. The boxing match is a hoot, and very well choreographed, as are all the skits. And what a beginning for a film, with city leaders spouting gibberish, probably as Chaplin's dig at the ""talkies"". Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance ... just terrific!Melancholy at times, the film's music really tugs at your heartstrings. Maybe it's sentimental and manipulative. But given the abiding and Zen-like qualities of the tramp, some sentimentality is quite appropriate. And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot action.Production design is sparse and at times drab. That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obvious.Comedy here is simple and effective. The main character expresses heart and humanity. The little tramp is an unforgettable character. And ""City Lights"" is a wonderful film.",zen like little tramp,waddling along with his cane derby hat that tiny mustache little tramp charles chaplin is visually unlike any character film history tramp is kind hearted always dignified hes simple soul who city lights tries help out young blind woman well played by virginia cherrill this is silent film course but tramps body language is his speech really noticeable feature tramp character is how he blends into everyday life hes more or less ignored by many laughed at by others girls grandmother never sees him at all only when millionaire is drunk does he see tramp as friend curious deep tramp gets into his fair share trouble but only through his bumbling efforts help girl boxing match is hoot very well choreographed as are all skits what beginning film with city leaders spouting gibberish probably as chaplins dig at talkies then way chaplin makes his grand entrance just terrific melancholy at times films music really tugs at your heartstrings maybe its sentimental manipulative but given abiding zen like qualities tramp some sentimentality is quite appropriate music is choreographed totally sync with plot action production design is sparse at times drab that film was made during great depression is beyond obvious comedy here is simple effective main character expresses heart humanity little tramp is unforgettable character city lights is wonderful film,0.5636141636141636,0.1432692307692308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,Seeing and Being Seen,"Spoilers herein.For me, this film falls not into the category of favorite films (I'm a Marx brothers kind of guy) but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important movies.That's because it has two features that I truly appreciate.It is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible. Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work. Not so with a small list of projects from Welles, Kurosawa, Eisenstein, ... and this one project of Chaplin's. They are wholly original, springing from some nether world.But the other element is the one that impresses the most. This film is about itself, about the art of visual narrative. Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new. The issues are centered on what the audience `sees,' so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees, he builds that into the fabric of the story.The primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing' him in her own way. Then `sees' him at the end in a different way. The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not. Nearly all the jokes, indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic: the elevator which is not seen but then was, the burglars the same, the Tramp on the statue, on the barrel. Even seeing the cigar before the bum does. Even us seeing the soap and the foreman not.The `seeing' is carried over to `hearing' with the politician and whistle jokes. And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows' us something else: he writes and conducts an amazing score instead. This is truly amazing (and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriously).No wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made. But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative, my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downey's (and to some extent Depp's). Comic timing is something that evolves, and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to see.Trivia: Chaplin found the `blind' girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw. She's pretty as well of course, but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew. See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight (a performance) and her reaction to his performance in the film.",seeing being seen,spoilers herein me this film falls not into category favorite films im marx brothers kind guy but earns instead place very short list most important movies thats because it has two features that i truly appreciate it is as pure vision its creator as is possible nearly all other films are engineered prior work not so with small list projects welles kurosawa eisenstein this one project chaplins they are wholly original springing some nether world but other element is one that impresses most this film is about itself about art visual narrative chaplin was intelligent enough know that what he was doing was new issues are centered what audience sees so while he struggles with what how audience sees he builds that into fabric story primary framing is about blind girl who falls love with him by seeing him her own way then sees him at end different way rich man recognizes tramp when drunk but does not when he is not nearly all jokes indeed every element film is about this same dynamic elevator which is not seen but then was burglars same tramp statue barrel even seeing cigar before bum does even us seeing soap foreman not seeing is carried over hearing with politician whistle jokes then even further as charlie turns his back new technology giving us speech instead shows us something else he writes conducts amazing score instead this is truly amazing one reason take mike figgis seriously no wonder orson welles considered this most important film ever made but as best watch because film is so derivative my own gold standard tramp is robert downeys some extent depps comic timing is something that evolves those men make more effective tramp my modern ability see trivia chaplin found blind girl group spectators at fight was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw shes pretty as well course but certainly not prettiest chaplin knew see how chaplin separately works both fight performance her reaction his performance film,0.5624933222805563,0.20524546375610206,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10.0,"In my honest opinion, this is Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece","As much as I loved The Kid, The Gold Rush, Modern Times and The Great Dictator, City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece. And there are several reasons why this is so for me.I love how City Lights is filmed, once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets. The music is also a delight(though my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times) with plenty of themes that stuck in my head, while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand. The comedy is brilliantly done, the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin movie(along with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush, the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator) but ever in a comedy, while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girl(played touchingly by Virginia Cherrill) he falls in love with. And I also found the close-up climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity. Chaplin is superb, his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with Cherrill.Overall, yet another Chaplin masterpiece, yet for me this is the best of them all. 10/10 Bethany Cox",my honest opinion this is charlie chaplins masterpiece,as much as i loved kid gold rush modern times great dictator city lights is film i consider charlie chaplins masterpiece there are several reasons why this is so me i love how city lights is filmed once again cinematography is stunning as are costumes sets music is also delight though my favourite soundtrack chaplin movie is one modern times with plenty themes that stuck my head while sound effects are wonderfully incorporated subtitles easy understand comedy is brilliantly done scene boxing ring is not only one my favourite scenes chaplin movie along with final sequence dance bread rolls gold rush final scene kid speech great dictator but ever comedy while there is very touching love story between tramp little blind girl played touchingly by virginia cherrill he falls love with i also found close up climax achingly poignant because its beauty ambiguity chaplin is superb his pantomime skills physical humour are extremely well judged he is acts beautifully with cherrill overall yet another chaplin masterpiece yet me this is best them all 10 10 bethany cox,0.6640306122448979,0.38288690476190473,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.42, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,Chaplin at the Top of his Game,"Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote, performed, directed and scored one of film's finest masterpieces.The story is about the ""Little Tramp"" befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich. Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the woman.In an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy. Drunk, dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty, a comic ballet. Chaplin's performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent. By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession. Some sound is used sparingly (brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard) but no intelligible words are uttered. The track and Chaplin's score is lyrical, energized and integral. The film is perfectly constructed.In the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment, saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale. Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to.",chaplin at top his game,four years into sound charlie chaplin wrote performed directed scored one films finest masterpieces story is about little tramp befriending blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich along way he manages get into series unintentional fixes with large cast foils at his disposal as he struggles finance operation woman incredible display comic talent chaplin bombards audience with scene after scene magnificently choreographed comedy drunk dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is rare combination comedy beauty comic ballet chaplins performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with city lights where only chaplin would dare challenge naturally progressive trend technological status quo by daring make silent by pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop history profession some sound is used sparingly brilliantly with statue dedication piano keyboard but no intelligible words are uttered track chaplins score is lyrical energized integral film is perfectly constructed masterful hands chaplin he avoids bathos his scenes with blind woman by severing sentimentality scene with comic moment saving it all incredibly touching moving finale up until then it is display comic genius that only handful others might lay claim,0.6604761904761905,0.26007142857142856,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.55}"

9.0,Another Emotional Masterpiece by Chaplin whose Climax will haunt me FOREVER.,"City Lights (1931) : Brief Review -Another Emotional Masterpiece by Chaplin whose Climax will haunt me FOREVER. You know I often try to separate the films which have left me speechless with their haunting climaxes, and guees what? Chaplin has the most number of such films in my list. The Circus (1928), City Lights (1931), The Great Dictator (1940) and Limelight (1952) are those 4 films of Charles Chaplin that left me stunned with their climax scenes. City Lights is so emotional, impulsive and generous by nature that any person with the heart at right place just can't hate it. And beyond that, can't stop crying in the those last 5 minutes when your heart will be going through a massive pain attack. That face Chaplin makes while accepting the flower in the climax is just wonderful, unbeatable and unthinkable. Believe me, i will never forget that one moment as long as i am watching films in this life. So, City Lights is another social plug-in by Chaplin but this time without any negative effects. This one is full of positiveness and kindness. With the aid of a wealthy erratic tippler, a dewy-eyed tramp who has fallen in love with a sightless flower girl accumulates money to be able to help her medically. Charles Chaplin delivers one hell of a performance which is beyond any award trophies and critics listing. The audience will remember his act in City Lights FOREVER and that's the biggest honour any actor could ever receive. With the terrific dose of comedy and pacy screenplay City Lights passes the time quickly and you don't even get time to prepare for that heart-wrenching climax. It hits you and it hits you so hard even before you realise that it has just happened and it stays with you for a while even after the screen is gone blank. Overall, A MASTERPIECE beyond emotional measurements.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest.",another emotional masterpiece by chaplin whose climax will haunt me forever,city lights 1931 brief review another emotional masterpiece by chaplin whose climax will haunt me forever you know i often try separate films which have left me speechless with their haunting climaxes guees what chaplin has most number such films my list circus 1928 city lights 1931 great dictator 1940 limelight 1952 are those 4 films charles chaplin that left me stunned with their climax scenes city lights is so emotional impulsive generous by nature that any person with heart at right place just cant hate it beyond that cant stop crying those last 5 minutes when your heart will be going through massive pain attack that face chaplin makes while accepting flower climax is just wonderful unbeatable unthinkable believe me i will never forget that one moment as long as i am watching films this life so city lights is another social plug by chaplin but this time without any negative effects this one is full positiveness kindness with aid wealthy erratic tippler dewy eyed tramp who has fallen love with sightless flower girl accumulates money be able help her medically charles chaplin delivers one hell performance which is beyond any award trophies critics listing audience will remember his act city lights forever thats biggest honour any actor could ever receive with terrific dose comedy pacy screenplay city lights passes time quickly you dont even get time prepare that heart wrenching climax it hits you it hits you so hard even before you realise that it has just happened it stays with you while even after screen is gone blank overall masterpiece beyond emotional measurements rating 9 10 by,0.5089682539682541,0.10369047619047621,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,No Words...,"No words can describe the majestic nobility of this movie. Every time I see a new movie coming out that is touted as the greatest thing since sliced bread, plastic and microwave technology, I sink deeper into an unspoken depression because this movie has not surged forth as one of the truly sublime creations of the entire film era.It's simplicity cloaks a recondite whole that few will admit to understanding. Yet Chaplin speaks in an easily understandable language: the speech of human movement and emotion.To say that Chaplin was a master is understating the breadth of his gifts. He combined comedy with pathos, added a hefty dash of physical comedy and threw it all into a bowl of drama. Deep, personal drama. The kind of drama that envelops our daily lives but we are too aware of the rest of the world to discern it for its full worth. The result is a delicious meal perfectly and equally suitable for a gourmet or a gourmand.Many mistake his brand of comedy for vapid sentimentality. But they are missing the reality that life is full of sentiment...pure and noble sentiment. Chaplin's passion is universal and it has lasted for nearly a hundred years -- there is no doubt that his brand of life's basic truths will endure until there is a new heaven and a new Earth.CITY LIGHTS mixes the very best that Chaplin had to offer. A gentle story, comedic interludes, human tragedy and a sense for the grandiloquence in the most innocent and tender emotions that humankind can conjure.SIDE NOTE: One of Chaplin's gifts was his musicmaking. Although I treasure all of his creations, I am glad that IMDB.com finally headed my suggestion and gave credit to, José Padilla, the Spanish composer of the famous ""Flower Girl' music as it should be.

8.0,Absolutely Beautiful,"City Lights is probably one of the most well loved, along with Modern Times, Chaplin movies. The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp, one of the most lovable, truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time. Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps, like they are labeled lazy and troublesome. It is very hard to hate The Tramp, because he gives so much when he has so little. He spends his time and money giving to people - whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl. Undoubtedly, we all have a little bit of The Tramp in us.The plot is as follows: the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street. She is poor and by a mere coincidence, believes that The Tramp is rich. He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide, and despite his gratefulness, doesn't remember the poor tramp unless he is drunk.City Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history. It's poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time. Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy. I believe it is a strong mixture of both, and a great balance of the two. Both comedic and touching, City Lights should not be missed by anyone.",absolutely beautiful,city lights is probably one most well loved along with modern times chaplin movies iconic everlasting character tramp one most lovable truly human sympathetic characters perhaps all time sometimes there is some hate towards tramps like they are labeled lazy troublesome it is very hard hate tramp because he gives so much when he has so little he spends his time money giving people whether it be saying millionaires life or buying flower blind girl undoubtedly we all have little bit tramp us plot is as follows tramp meets falls love with blind girl who sells flowers street she is poor by mere coincidence believes that tramp is rich he also saves drunken millionaire suicide despite his gratefulness doesnt remember poor tramp unless he is drunk city lights is no doubt magnificent feat motion picture history its poignant view world society leaves you laughing crying at same time some believe this should really be called drama instead comedy i believe it is strong mixture both great balance two both comedic touching city lights should not be missed by anyone,0.6154947916666665,0.08294270833333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.46}"
9.0,Sublime!,"A truly marvellous film, one to watch over and over again (as I have) and not tire of. If I remember right Chaplin basically made it up as he went along, with only the bones of the story and the ending in mind, tens of thousands of scene retakes later. This put the lid on silent films for good, CL could not have been bettered if they'd tried - and Chaplin did of course but failed with Modern Times.There's so many gags in CL it's pointless to pick any one out - the boxing match hardly counts as a gag, more a work of art - overall it's a relentless 80 minutes, the usual Chaplin roller-coaster of emotion. The dedicated know all this, the ones who only like violent colour talkies will scoff after having wasted their time trying to understand why this movie is so highly regarded. I wonder if they switch off before the end?The original for the set for the outside the blind girl's home still exists in Lambeth today, along of course with many other surviving places of Chaplin interest.",sublime,truly marvellous film one watch over over again as i have not tire if i remember right chaplin basically made it up as he went along with only bones story ending mind tens thousands scene retakes later this put lid silent films good cl could not have been bettered if theyd tried chaplin did course but failed with modern times theres so many gags cl its pointless pick any one out boxing match hardly counts as gag more work art overall its relentless 80 minutes usual chaplin roller coaster emotion dedicated know all this ones who only like violent colour talkies will scoff after having wasted their time trying understand why this movie is so highly regarded i wonder if they switch off before end original set outside blind girls home still exists lambeth today along course with many other surviving places chaplin interest,0.45495670995670995,0.013820346320346314,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,Blink once and you'll miss something funny!,"The jokes and comical moments are all performed in such an incredible high pace and very well timed and choreographed. The comical moments follow each other very rapidly. Big over-the-top hilarious situations as well as small subtle ones. You have no time to think about the one joke, since the next one is already occurring at that very moment. The movie is that fast going. Blink once and you'll miss something funny. This is slapstick film-making at its very best.Charles Chaplin performs his role with great charisma and agility, It's a quite psychical movie for him. The movie features jumping, falling and climbing, as you would obviously expect from a '30's slapstick movie.I must admit that a few of the Chaplin movies don't live up to their reputations but this one on the other hand really does. It's certainly one of the best comedies of the '30's and of all time. A true timeless comedy classic!But as you would expect from a Chaplin movie, it also is a movie with lots of heart and humanity. No matter how crazy the movie gets in parts, the movie never loses any of its credibility when it comes down to its drama and pureness. The movie is also made in a more realistic style, rather than a comical one that clearly and also predictably builds up toward a comical situations. This makes the movie all the more hilarious and strengthens the comical moments.The movie just doesn't only rely on its jokes and Chaplin antics but also has a great and compelling story of its own. It's a quite well written story, that moves over to a lot of different places and locations throughout and is therefore also loaded with lots of characters and situations. It makes the movie also very original.An absolute delightful movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",blink once youll miss something funny,jokes comical moments are all performed such incredible high pace very well timed choreographed comical moments follow each other very rapidly big over top hilarious situations as well as small subtle ones you have no time think about one joke since next one is already occurring at that very moment movie is that fast going blink once youll miss something funny this is slapstick film making at its very best charles chaplin performs his role with great charisma agility its quite psychical movie him movie features jumping falling climbing as you would obviously expect 30s slapstick movie i must admit that few chaplin movies dont live up their reputations but this one other hand really does its certainly one best comedies 30s all time true timeless comedy classic but as you would expect chaplin movie it also is movie with lots heart humanity no matter how crazy movie gets parts movie never loses any its credibility when it comes down its drama pureness movie is also made more realistic style rather than comical one that clearly also predictably builds up toward comical situations this makes movie all more hilarious strengthens comical moments movie just doesnt only rely its jokes chaplin antics but also has great compelling story its own its quite well written story that moves over lot different places locations throughout is therefore also loaded with lots characters situations it makes movie also very original absolute delightful movie 10 10,0.5948704243602203,0.2661753835733428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,A cinematic triumph ... a universal masterpiece ...,"Charlie Chaplin was the greatest film-maker of all-time  and only two words are enough to measure up the greatness of his talent and its cultural significance in Cinema's history: ""City Lights"", a title that resonates in my heart as the most inspiring triumph of the human spirit. ""City Lights"" is not just a film; it's a cinematic gift from a genius, who sublimated the simplicity of the pantomime to create the greatest and most universal romantic comedy that ever enchanted the silver screen.The universality and emotionality of the film have remained intact, and continue to provoke the laughs and the tears of movie lovers all over the world even after 80 years. It's an incredible achievement because it stood the test of time and transcended the geographical barriers when other classics are more appreciated in a sort of sentimental and magnanimous way, as if we're trying to repress the feeling that some elements have obviously dated. But Chaplin's film hasn't dated because it chose to be dated from the start, at the time of its release. It was a silent movie in the talking era, when all the fans were enthusiastic of hearing shouts, screams, cars, declarations of loves, bad-ass dialogs and all that new stuff, Chaplin, in an admirable confidence, did what he did the best, the pantomime, the only language that could fit for the most fascinating cinematic character: the Little Tramp.And what could have been a timely weakness quickly became the film's ticket for immortality. 1931's audiences applauded the film as a celebration of humanism that could never be imitated again. And only a movie with no words could have touched the hearts of so many people in the world, precisely, during an era where laughs and cheers, trust and optimism were needed. It didn't take a political or a denunciative approach to inspire the hearts, only laughs, cheers and the depiction of the most beautiful and valuables virtues of humanity. No speeches needed, words were as meaningless as these hilarious squawks we heard at the beginning. This gibberish talk is Chaplin reminding us of the futility of words, and we trust him. Maybe, dialogs make you miss the essential in a film.Antoine De Saint Exupéry, who wrote ""The Little Prince"", said: ""One sees well only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eyes."" I guess for Chaplin, who shared the same humanism of the French writer and pilot, you could translate his view on dialogs by this paraphrase : ""One sees well only with the eyes and the heart. The essential is inaudible to the ears"" No need for words but in ""City Lights"", our ears are enchanted by the beautiful ""flower girl"" melody, and sadness and happiness that inhabit the film has never been so graciously embodied. And while we float in this atmosphere, the action that follows is the tribute of Chaplin's comic genius, his body language and facial expressions are so rich, so fragile I can imagine my inner child being amused by this film, while I'm moved as an adult, by the purity of the character who wants to help this blind girl who sells flowers. ""The Little Tramp"" is the quintessential clown without a make-up and a true hero, a word often overused, but not in this case.The Tramp is a hero because of his altruistic nature. He's apolitical but indirectly highlights the social gaps in the modern cities, without letting the film fall into political denunciation. He saves a rich man who wants to commit a suicide and after having developed a fondness for him, the rich makes him discover the world, amusements, dance clubs, parties, all the decadence of the bourgeoisie where the Tramp obviously doesn't fit. But he stands, as a friend, and uses the friendship to help the blind girl who believes he's a rich man. It's the myth of the Charming Prince revisited by Chaplin, through a character driven by his heart. And despise this nobility of spirit, he's constantly bullied, hit, misunderstood. And this is where resides the sadness of the film, the struggle of the Tramp in this journey into the injustices of society. But he's a man, who gets hit but hits back, never remaining a victim, victims are helpless, the girl is helpless, if he becomes so, she has no salvation, the girl is his inspiration, and the only one who never harms him in the film.And boy, how many hits did he get ... of course, I'm referring to the hilarious legendary boxing scene ... probably one of the greatest Chaplin's moments. It has the format of his short stories, but here it does have a particular meaning, since we know what drives him to do so, he wants to get the money to pay the rent for the blind girl, his challenge is our hope, and we hope he'll get it. And as the ultimate tragic hero, not only he'll help her, but he'll get enough money to cure her blindness, before going to jail, rejected by the same rich friend who gave him the money. Rich are so rich, they're perverted by money, and treat friends as they deal with valuable things, but things have no value, love, feeling and generosity have.And the value of these things are illustrated in one of the greatest, if not the greatest concluding scene ever, where the blind girl, now cured, after giving the rose to the Tramp, understands that he is the ""rich man"", the Charming Prince who haunted her dreams. The Tramp is anxious, and timidly asks her if she can see now. The answer of the girl and the breathtaking concluding smile of the Tramp create the most beautiful and inspiring ending ever. Because she had just realized that she saw the essential, which ironically, was invisible to the eyes.",cinematic triumph universal masterpiece,charlie chaplin was greatest film maker all time only two words are enough measure up greatness his talent its cultural significance cinemas history city lights title that resonates my heart as most inspiring triumph human spirit city lights is not just film its cinematic gift genius who sublimated simplicity pantomime create greatest most universal romantic comedy that ever enchanted silver screen universality emotionality film have remained intact continue provoke laughs tears movie lovers all over world even after 80 years its incredible achievement because it stood test time transcended geographical barriers when other classics are more appreciated sort sentimental magnanimous way as if were trying repress feeling that some elements have obviously dated but chaplins film hasnt dated because it chose be dated start at time its release it was silent movie talking era when all fans were enthusiastic hearing shouts screams cars declarations loves bad ass dialogs all that new stuff chaplin admirable confidence did what he did best pantomime only language that could fit most fascinating cinematic character little tramp what could have been timely weakness quickly became films ticket immortality 1931s audiences applauded film as celebration humanism that could never be imitated again only movie with no words could have touched hearts so many people world precisely during era where laughs cheers trust optimism were needed it didnt take political or denunciative approach inspire hearts only laughs cheers depiction most beautiful valuables virtues humanity no speeches needed words were as meaningless as these hilarious squawks we heard at beginning this gibberish talk is chaplin reminding us futility words we trust him maybe dialogs make you miss essential film antoine de saint exup ry who wrote little prince said one sees well only with heart essential is invisible eyes i guess chaplin who shared same humanism french writer pilot you could translate his view dialogs by this paraphrase one sees well only with eyes heart essential is inaudible ears no need words but city lights our ears are enchanted by beautiful flower girl melody sadness happiness that inhabit film has never been so graciously embodied while we float this atmosphere action that follows is tribute chaplins comic genius his body language facial expressions are so rich so fragile i can imagine my inner child being amused by this film while im moved as adult by purity character who wants help this blind girl who sells flowers little tramp is quintessential clown without make up true hero word often overused but not this case tramp is hero because his altruistic nature hes apolitical but indirectly highlights social gaps modern cities without letting film fall into political denunciation he saves rich man who wants commit suicide after having developed fondness him rich makes him discover world amusements dance clubs parties all decadence bourgeoisie where tramp obviously doesnt fit but he stands as friend uses friendship help blind girl who believes hes rich man its myth charming prince revisited by chaplin through character driven by his heart despise this nobility spirit hes constantly bullied hit misunderstood this is where resides sadness film struggle tramp this journey into injustices society but hes man who gets hit but hits back never remaining victim victims are helpless girl is helpless if he becomes so she has no salvation girl is his inspiration only one who never harms him film boy how many hits did he get course im referring hilarious legendary boxing scene probably one greatest chaplins moments it has format his short stories but here it does have particular meaning since we know what drives him do so he wants get money pay rent blind girl his challenge is our hope we hope hell get it as ultimate tragic hero not only hell help her but hell get enough money cure her blindness before going jail rejected by same rich friend who gave him money rich are so rich theyre perverted by money treat friends as they deal with valuable things but things have no value love feeling generosity have value these things are illustrated one greatest if not greatest concluding scene ever where blind girl now cured after giving rose tramp understands that he is rich man charming prince who haunted her dreams tramp is anxious timidly asks her if she can see now answer girl breathtaking concluding smile tramp create most beautiful inspiring ending ever because she had just realized that she saw essential which ironically was invisible eyes,0.5565401723658604,0.20465318320822906,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Classic Chaplin,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there. Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of film-making. Chaplin's last 'silent' film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl. He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide. The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk. To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the man's wealth to make her fall in love with him. The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesn't recognize the tramp anymore. On top of this the flower girl has to pay 22 dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment. Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love. Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forth.The outcome of the movie is to almost all people known. It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film. The movie itself still is masterpiece more than 70 years after it's release. I personally rate this as Chaplin's second best I have seen so far. My favorite remains The Gold Rush. Still this movie gets 5/5 stars from me.,classic chaplin,city lights is simply put one best movies out there every scene is classic had huge impact history film making chaplins last silent film tells story poor little man tramp played by chaplin who falls love with blind flower girl he becomes friends with wealthy man who constantly tries commit suicide man only recognizes tramp character when he is drunk impress flower girl tramp uses mans wealth make her fall love with him only problem is that when man is sober he doesnt recognize tramp anymore top this flower girl has pay 22 dollars rent or she will be thrown out her apartment now tramp desperately seeks jobs city help his love out this simple plot great comedy heart breaking moments come forth outcome movie is almost all people known it is regarded as one best endings ever taped film movie itself still is masterpiece more than 70 years after its release i personally rate this as chaplins second best i have seen so far my favorite remains gold rush still this movie gets 5 5 stars me,0.5410317460317461,0.19819444444444442,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Sublime Chaplin Masterpiece,"Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema. Coming up through the ranks, he gradually achieved a god-like stature, being awarded total control of every facet of the production.Not only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be (as in ""The Kid"") but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process. This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days, weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even (in the case of ""The Gold Rush"") cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over again.He cleverly duped chief studio- and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his free-wheeling and gross inclinations, thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hit-and-miss schemes and trial-and-error ""madness.""In other words, Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush, with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases. Fortunately, he was a genius, and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagence.It was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging, and there were no set rules. People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium -- and Chaplin helped to establish its early parameters.He was certainly and autocrat, yet that doesn't really matter when it comes to film works. It's the product that counts. In the case of ""City Lights,"" all the blood-sweat-and-tears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort. Now that all the frustration, anger, and outrage associated with the behind-the-scenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past, what remains is a genuinely moving film classic. Sometimes great enterprises require considerable hardship to forge them into being. The greater the achievement, often the greater the challenge and period of endurance. Whatever the case, we are the appreciative recipients of this masterwork, which takes its place besides ""Modern Times"" and ""The Gold Rush"" as one of Chaplin's consummate expressions.",sublime chaplin masterpiece,chaplin was unique presence history early cinema coming up through ranks he gradually achieved god like stature being awarded total control every facet production not only was he often sole person who knew what end product was be as kid but he was also allowed elaborately improvise creative process this often meant doing countless scores retakes over days weeks even months holding up cast crew days while he brooded over just what do next even case gold rush cancelling expensive weeks location shooting returning studio start all over again he cleverly duped chief studio bank chiefs into somehow going along with his free wheeling gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hit miss schemes trial error madness other words chaplin used entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure create his personal canvases fortunately he was genius at right place time be allowed get away with such unprecedented extravagence it was young growing industry when chaplin began emerging there were no set rules people were still trying figure out just what could be done with medium chaplin helped establish its early parameters he was certainly autocrat yet that doesnt really matter when it comes film works its product that counts case city lights all blood sweat tears that it took achieve finished product was more than worth effort now that all frustration anger outrage associated with behind scenes unfoldment this highly troubled production are well past what remains is genuinely moving film classic sometimes great enterprises require considerable hardship forge them into being greater achievement often greater challenge period endurance whatever case we are appreciative recipients this masterwork which takes its place besides modern times gold rush as one chaplins consummate expressions,0.5430272108843537,0.15555555555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"
