8.0,The series ends on a very strong note.,"The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10",series ends very strong note,conclusion series hits some strongest emotional beats mainly due our long standing connection with characters provides some grand visual treats form extended magical battles while harry potter deathly hallows part 2 2011 may be biggest scale it is entertaining it does feel lacking depth since some things are left oddly unexplained instead comes across as extended third act its duration it actually plays out like one long climax with little build up required further invest audience but at least its well paced doesnt hang about strong note which end phenomenal series 8 10,0.4562037037037038,0.12412037037037038,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.46}"
,End of an era... End of our childhoods... End of Harry Potter,"What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.Go see this movie!",end era end our childhoods end harry potter,what can i say this was by far most amazing finale any fan could have asked i cried i laughed i was short breath many instances i was disturbed but overall i was thoroughly satisfied with conclusion this series i felt something amazing after movie ended something i didnt feel after reading book being able watch end harry potter big screen really brought impact just how much this series has touched not only my life but lives everyone around me deathly hallows part 2 is by far my opinion best movie 2011 quite possibly one best movies all time i dont want give any spoilers i just want express how happy i am with this film it picks up where part 1 left off all characters get closure they deserve story just comes full circle bravo that is all i have say thank you everyone involved these movies taking world such amazing journey j k rowling thank you writing such masterpiece that will truly live my heart so many others hearts years come go see this movie,0.5567307692307694,0.34178321678321677,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.47, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,"Gives meaning to the phrase, save the best until last","I have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries.What stood out for me was not only the darkness of it, particularly the last thirty minutes or so which was a tad anti-climatic but very intense too and also Snape's death, but also the emotional impact. Gringotts(especially for the effects, the dragon being the standout), the moving Ressurrection stone sequence and Harry's final scene with Dumbedore were very well done, but my favourite was the Snape's memory sequence, which was beautifully done and quite poignant. Not only that, it's my favourite Harry Potter scene alongside the Three Brothers animated sequence and the Cave Scene. The 19 Years Later scene was quite affectionate as well, with the use of the original music and all.Once again, the production values are impeccable. The effects, apart from the odd ropey one in the Room of Requirement scene and Bellatrix's death, are excellent particularly at Gringotts, while the scenery and cinematography are magical with a touch of austerity too, and David Yates delivers his best directing job. There's also my favourite of Alexandre Desplat's scores, I loved his ones for Girl with a Pearl Earring and The King's Speech, the score was also one of the few good points about Twilight:New Moon and I found his score for the previous part very effective. What I loved though about this score was not just how beautiful, haunting and how incredibly melancholic it was, but also how much it enhanced the drama.The script is very good a vast majority of the time, doing a noble attempt to stick to the spirit of the book. The humour is less stilted and corny than I can find it to be, and when the tone is tense and poignant the writing does an above decent job reflecting that. The pacing is never dull, if deliberately less rushed(Goblet of Fire) or glacial(Deathly Hallows Part 1) as some of the other entries, and the storytelling is always interesting and compelling while never convoluted.The acting is very good. Rupert Grint is great as he consistently is, Emma Watson while not quite as good as she was in Deathly Hallows Part 1 gives one of her better performances of the series, Maggie Smith and John Hurt are always good value and while I didn't find him easy to warm to at first until Half-Blood Prince in his brief but relevant appearance Michael Gambon is also good. Helena Bonham-Carter, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane and Tom Felton while neither are at their best here bring a pleasing sheen to the film. Three actors in particular I found stood out and gave their best performances of the series. One is Daniel Radcliffe, at first I found him likable yet wooden with some questionable delivery, however overtime I think he's grown with more emotional range than usual. Two is Alan Rickman, while I have considered him one of the more consistent actors of this series him and the character of Snape really shine here, Rickman is especially good in the Snape's memory sequence. Three is Ralph Fiennes, I think it helps that like Snape Voldemort is given more scope here, that said Fiennes is appropriately sinister in the role and certainly looks the part.In conclusion, a wonderful film and for me the best of the series. And I still stand by my initial feeling that it was better filming the book as two movies, it would've have felt far too rushed as one. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",gives meaning phrase save best until last,i have enjoyed all films love books after how much i loved deathly hallows part 1 this entry continuing exactly where previous film left off had lot live up it is less faithful mammoth but very interesting wonderful book than its predecessor however i found this apart one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out arrival hogsmede duel between mrs weasley bellatrix seemed little rushed had more flow was better paced had more coherent storytelling less admiring scenery than previous entries what stood out me was not only darkness it particularly last thirty minutes or so which was tad anti climatic but very intense too also snapes death but also emotional impact gringotts especially effects dragon being standout moving ressurrection stone sequence harrys final scene with dumbedore were very well done but my favourite was snapes memory sequence which was beautifully done quite poignant not only that its my favourite harry potter scene alongside three brothers animated sequence cave scene 19 years later scene was quite affectionate as well with use original music all once again production values are impeccable effects apart odd ropey one room requirement scene bellatrixs death are excellent particularly at gringotts while scenery cinematography are magical with touch austerity too david yates delivers his best directing job theres also my favourite alexandre desplats scores i loved his ones girl with pearl earring kings speech score was also one few good points about twilight new moon i found his score previous part very effective what i loved though about this score was not just how beautiful haunting how incredibly melancholic it was but also how much it enhanced drama script is very good vast majority time doing noble attempt stick spirit book humour is less stilted corny than i can find it be when tone is tense poignant writing does above decent job reflecting that pacing is never dull if deliberately less rushed goblet fire or glacial deathly hallows part 1 as some other entries storytelling is always interesting compelling while never convoluted acting is very good rupert grint is great as he consistently is emma watson while not quite as good as she was deathly hallows part 1 gives one her better performances series maggie smith john hurt are always good value while i didnt find him easy warm at first until half blood prince his brief but relevant appearance michael gambon is also good helena bonham carter david thewlis gary oldman robbie coltrane tom felton while neither are at their best here bring pleasing sheen film three actors particular i found stood out gave their best performances series one is daniel radcliffe at first i found him likable yet wooden with some questionable delivery however overtime i think hes grown with more emotional range than usual two is alan rickman while i have considered him one more consistent actors this series him character snape really shine here rickman is especially good snapes memory sequence three is ralph fiennes i think it helps that like snape voldemort is given more scope here that said fiennes is appropriately sinister role certainly looks part conclusion wonderful film me best series i still stand by my initial feeling that it was better filming book as two movies it wouldve have felt far too rushed as one 9 10 bethany cox,0.52313718927121,0.31706542598295173,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.23}"

10.0,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II gets everything right to send off Harry on a cinematic high,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.",harry potter deathly hallows part ii gets everything right send off harry cinematic high,i am huge fan harry potter books theyre all so great magical but i didnt think film series were perfect at all but they were still great movies with that i was extremely excited see end film franchise impressed with trailers so i had high expectations thankfully it did not disappoint harry potter deathly hallows part ii blew past my already high expectations i was enthralled whole movie looked spectacular cinematography extremely well done art direction was incredible movie was beautiful look at visuals were spectacular truly oscar worthy set designers cinematographers really need be awarded their work because it looks like they spend time money look film cast film was pretty much perfect they should all be applauded too emma watson as usual is great shell have bright career ahead her rupert grint is pretty much great also he is fine actor indeed daniel radcliffe did amazing job was very memorable as harry potter although i think ralph fiennes was star film he did unbelievable job as evil crazy lord voldemort i think he deserves oscar nomination his role rest cast were also great too we all grew up overtime with series we followed adventures harry potter around 10 years i think it seems very weird that there will be no more harry potter films look forward too i will miss franchise very much however i am happy series got amazing ending harry potter deathly hallows part ii is not only best film series but it will probably be one best films 2011 everyone should see this film even if they dont like past harry potter films,0.731038961038961,0.35512987012987013,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,LIGHTNING HAS STRUCK,"Perhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.The direction of Chris Columbus was by far the best as well as the screen adaptations, which more closely followed the books. Starting with the third installment, the audience got short changed (There, I said it) especially those who didn't read the books...such as myself. This wasn't a bad thing as it led to a bonding with my niece who did read the books and I would take her to the films so she could explain them to me. Like Hermione, she is one of those ""insufferable know-it-alls"" who loves to let you know what she knows. (Good luck with that brain surgeon thing.)In this final episode, the gang of 3 go after the remaining Horcrux(s) which are now easier to locate than in the last 2 films. This one follows the later films in that it lacks the humor of the earlier ones.The movie, like the series drives home the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage. Goblins, spiders, troll, elves, death eaters, a dragon, and of course he who we do not speak. Personally, I would have done the ending differently, especially with Snape and Malfoy. But I don't want to discuss any possible plot spoilers.",lightning has struck,perhaps this is best place review series as well as last installment we have seen daniel radcliffe mature fairy bad actor one that is fairly convincing particularly his standing up aberforth dumbledore emma watson has gone awkward kid who wore her emotions her sleeve maxims top 100 hottest women passing richard harris was major let down series as michael gambon couldnt really fill his shoes most interesting complex character was that snape alan rickman made series with his portrayal casting quirky minor characters made story most enjoyable all way down mrs fink rowlings use classical mythology astronomy occult made series incredible educational experience one my favorite characters was under used luna lovegood she was breath fresh air direction chris columbus was by far best as well as screen adaptations which more closely followed books starting with third installment audience got short changed there i said it especially those who didnt read books such as myself this wasnt bad thing as it led bonding with my niece who did read books i would take her films so she could explain them me like hermione she is one those insufferable know it alls who loves let you know what she knows good luck with that brain surgeon thing this final episode gang 3 go after remaining horcrux s which are now easier locate than last 2 films this one follows later films that it lacks humor earlier ones movie like series drives home ideas teamwork friendship courage goblins spiders troll elves death eaters dragon course he who we do not speak personally i would have done ending differently especially with snape malfoy but i dont want discuss any possible plot spoilers,0.49823848238482393,0.14922086720867206,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
7.0,"Good Movie, But a Disappointing & Unsatisfying End to the series...","Overall, it may be said that the movie was good. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.But, this isn't the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end. A movie which is supposed to mark the End of an Era could have been much better. With the expectations I had, I was a little disappointed. It DID NOT have the depth and the emotional impact WASN'T nearly as good as the book. I was pleased with Part 1 because it stuck very well to the book. That's what I was expecting with this too. But no... they had to spoil it. What's the use of making the movie in two parts if they can't do justice to the book? They should have made it a Trilogy (as all great movies are made, like 'The Godfather Trilogy', 'The LOTR Trilogy', original 'Star Wars Trilogy', The Bourne Trilogy', etc.) or they should have increased the length of the 2 parts. Who forced them to fit the whole thing within 2hrs.15mins. each. ??(Every part of LOTR is over 3&1/2 hrs. long. No one had an issue with it). . *** SPOILERS **THE GOOD :Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well.Throughout the series, Snape has been rather emotionless and monotonous. But, in the pensieve, we see a refreshingly new emotional side of him.Gringott's scene was nicely shown.They added the scene where Hermione & Ron destroy Hufflepuff's cup.They show the future (19 years later) scene. I thought it would be cut.THE BAD : (I have to mention these because I was disappointed as hell)My Biggest Disappointment - Snape's Memories. They showed the whole thing within a minute. They're some of the most interesting & touching scenes of the story. They just rushed through it, even excluding many of the memories. Fred's death. They don't even show it. Then later it was ridiculous to see Mrs. Weasley angry at Bellatrix when the latter was fighting Ginny.The battle was too short and didn't the magnitude and impact as in the book, with Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Spiders, Ghosts, etc.They don't show the Common Rooms. I always imagined it while reading the books. But I badly wanted to see them in the movie.They don't show Harry using the Cruciatus Curse on the one of the Carrows.They wasted time in Nagini's chase.They don't mention about Teddy Lupin and that Harry was his Godfather. They don't mention the names of Harry's other two kids.No mention about the significance of the horcruxes.No mention of Bloody Baron and his link with Ravenclaw's diadem.No mention about how the Invisibility Cloak came into the possession of the Potters, how Harry and Voldemort are related through the Peverell brothers.They don't show how Dumbledore communicated with Snape after he died.Harry doesn't even mend is wand. He directly snaps the Elder Wand into two pieces...In the future scene, all the funny and cheerful dialogues are excluded. Everyone's just smiling and staring at each other. And moreover, none of the them seemed in their late thirties. Didn't the film-makers have enough money to hire good make-up artists.THE UGLY :Dumbledore's Story. He's my most favourite character in the book. There's nothing about him in the movie. They just say he had secrets (what secrets??). They don't even tell the story of Dumbledore sister, Ariana. They don't show him getting emotional at King's Cross.The use of ridiculous one-liners and humourless jokes when the situation is so intense and sad.Harry & Voldemort had their final fight in the middle of nowhere. No one was even around to watch it. (In the book, they were in the middle of the whole crowd.)Bellatrix and Voldemort die bursting into confetti!ALL IN ALL, it wasn't the send-off the series deserved. Someone who has grown up reading the books and watching the movies in the series will understand my woes...",good movie but disappointing unsatisfying end series,overall it may be said that movie was good direction cinematography special effects were brilliantly executed acting was good too children have grown so much but this isnt way harry potter saga was meant end movie which is supposed mark end era could have been much better with expectations i had i was little disappointed it did not have depth emotional impact wasnt nearly as good as book i was pleased with part 1 because it stuck very well book thats what i was expecting with this too but no they had spoil it whats use making movie two parts if they cant do justice book they should have made it trilogy as all great movies are made like godfather trilogy lotr trilogy original star wars trilogy bourne trilogy etc or they should have increased length 2 parts who forced them fit whole thing within 2hrs 15mins each every part lotr is over 3 1 2 hrs long no one had issue with it spoilers good snapes voldemorts characters were played quite well throughout series snape has been rather emotionless monotonous but pensieve we see refreshingly new emotional side him gringotts scene was nicely shown they added scene where hermione ron destroy hufflepuffs cup they show future 19 years later scene i thought it would be cut bad i have mention these because i was disappointed as hell my biggest disappointment snapes memories they showed whole thing within minute theyre some most interesting touching scenes story they just rushed through it even excluding many memories freds death they dont even show it then later it was ridiculous see mrs weasley angry at bellatrix when latter was fighting ginny battle was too short didnt magnitude impact as book with centaurs goblins kreecher hagrid spiders ghosts etc they dont show common rooms i always imagined it while reading books but i badly wanted see them movie they dont show harry using cruciatus curse one carrows they wasted time naginis chase they dont mention about teddy lupin that harry was his godfather they dont mention names harrys other two kids no mention about significance horcruxes no mention bloody baron his link with ravenclaws diadem no mention about how invisibility cloak came into possession potters how harry voldemort are related through peverell brothers they dont show how dumbledore communicated with snape after he died harry doesnt even mend is wand he directly snaps elder wand into two pieces future scene all funny cheerful dialogues are excluded everyones just smiling staring at each other moreover none them seemed their late thirties didnt film makers have enough money hire good make up artists ugly dumbledores story hes my most favourite character book theres nothing about him movie they just say he had secrets what secrets they dont even tell story dumbledore sister ariana they dont show him getting emotional at kings cross use ridiculous one liners humourless jokes when situation is so intense sad harry voldemort had their final fight middle nowhere no one was even around watch it book they were middle whole crowd bellatrix voldemort die bursting into confetti all all it wasnt send off series deserved someone who has grown up reading books watching movies series will understand my woes,0.5195419008851845,0.062154325773728814,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,An Exhilarating and Beautiful Conclusion to a Magnificent Saga.,"I saw this at a preview screening in London.Deathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.If you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion. There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story. I have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing). Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.Oh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end.",exhilarating beautiful conclusion magnificent saga,i saw this at preview screening london deathly hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace beautifully orchestrated climax that i am sure will satisfy both lovers books films if you have read books as i have you will be glad know major key moments are intact much is missing but i wont dwell that no point its how well this movie plays out me it rolls wonderfully between excitement thrills emotional drama towards satisfactory though slightly rushed conclusion there are at least 2 sequences so powerful that i defy anyone not at least stifle tear or choke little one those sequence is exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal whole story i have say that despite woes we book readers have when elements big chunks it too are omitted movies much credit still has go steve kloves adapting books big screen cleverly weaving changing even adding new big elements give kinetic flow narrative here it all comes together superbly david yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors last 4 films blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting daniel radcliffe had carry this movie more than any other has done so brilliantly complemented with great support his two companions emma watson rupert grint pretty much all characters we have met all movies have made appearance this finale but one actor stands out alan rickman his portrayal professor snape has always been joy watch if little novel but here his scenes will leave dramatic engraving my memory here he elevates his portrayal one most complex character young adult literature unforgettable piercingly emotional one another actor who really shines few scenes that he has is matthew lewis as neville longbottom who we see gradually transforming over past films clumsy bullied boy brave warrior this final film many other british thespians series also have their few moments shine especially maggie smiths professor mcgonagal who was delight watch as she takes charge defence hogwarth school as spectacle battle showdowns while not at scale lord rings i honestly cant think how it could have been done better as film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions narrative its actually more visceral dynamic than rather smaller scale battle brilliant novels not take anything away rowlings writing do i have any gripes yes i do although i applaud steve kloves difficult screenplay adaption i think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers book will understand this might annoy you if you havent read books but its small gripe because what we get is delightful what amazing achievement faithfully bring rowlings epic saga big screen with same cast largely same crew maintaining brilliant quality right end oh my god its only just sinking this was end but what great great end,0.5784636381021921,0.2519226255672039,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,An exhilarating action-packed spectacle that delivers a magnificent finish to the beloved fantasy franchise,"An incredible journey that began a decade ago finally arrives at its close with David Yates' ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"", as 'The Boy Who Lived' comes face to face with 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' in an epic showdown between good and evil. And what a showdown it is- tense, thrilling, breathtaking, and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of. Whereas the first instalment of the 'Deathly Hallows' emphasised the profound sense of loss and isolation among Harry, Ron and Hermoine, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Yates leaves behind the moody atmosphere of the previous movie for newfound immediacy and urgency. This is all about that final battle where only one can live, and from start to finish- for once in a Harry Potter movie- the action is swift and relentless.Part II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.There is precious little time to waste, and the first we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione, they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their break-in settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film, as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuice-disguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first 'Harry Potter' movie in 3D, Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a roller-coaster ride through the vault, culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.But as readers of the book will tell you, the last stand happens back at Hogwarts, and true enough, after this thrilling early set-piece at Gringotts, the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be, and Harry's return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance. Fans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight- in particular, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic, and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic send-off they deserve.Yet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape's (Alan Rickman) vindication, long thought to be the Judas Iscariot-equivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape's true colours, and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an action-packed spectacle, it is to Yates' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling.Though brief, this revelation also works brilliantly as a catalyst that propels Harry to come to terms with the sacrifice he has to make. Harry's realization of this leads up perfectly to the ultimate duel between him and Voldemort, one that is fierce, ferocious and- thanks to Yates' imagination- more exhilarating than reading it off the page. The outcome of that battle shouldn't be a secret by now, and when the 'happily-ever-after' coda in Rowling's book set 19 years later is also faithfully adapted here, you can't quite help but be moved by how it so properly gives the series closure.They are of course no longer kids here- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson now young adults who have through the film series grown up right under our eyes. While Part I had greater emphasis on Ron and Hermoine, the focus here is squarely on Harry and Radcliffe truly shines in this instalment- his usual understated performance allowing his audience to appreciate the enormities of the challenge before Harry.That we can be so fully immersed in Harry's world is testament to the craft of each and every one of the technical team. Production designer Stuart Craig does a masterful job portraying the devastation around Hogwarts, complimented nicely by Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography and Mark Day's skillful editing. Alexandre Desplat's evocative score, which combines his own elegiac work with both the John Williams theme as well as Nicholas Hooper's mournful composition for the sixth movie, works magic with the visuals. And most deserving of credit is none other than director Yates himself, who has matured movie after movie to deliver a crowning achievement for the series.Pardon us if we have also taken this opportunity to extol the merits of the 'Harry Potter' franchise- it's really hard not to considering how this is the last time we will see the Potter-world in its current incarnation. It is this to which the movie is a farewell to, and it is as beautiful a farewell as it can be, packed with visual spectacle on a scale never before seen in any of the other films and fused with the same powerful emotion as Part I and the Yates films before. All good- even great- things have to come to an end, so there is really no better way to bid adieu than with this grand and glorious final chapter.",exhilarating action packed spectacle that delivers

9.0,Better Ending,"Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.For me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not, you'll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series.",better ending,endings are usually problems most movie series they usually end up being mediocre unsatisfying or they are made cash people great thing about harry potter movies filmmakers are taking their job seriously harry potter deathly hallows part 2 is great ending series its more than throwing lot action exposition harry potter deathly hallows part 2 is one those conclusion that actually care about series deathly hallows part 1 is just first half second act story deathly hallows part 2 begins straight forward its continuation last harry potter film course if you havent seen deathly hallows part 1 or any harry potter movies youll be confused death obvious isnt it its pretty clever make whole deathly hallows story like slow burn it started silent thrills plans escapes big loud battles series doesnt only end with big loud action it also gives us some nostalgia old harry potter films we still get see more characters movie itself is pretty exciting its good choice let david yates direct rest potter films because he made this series darker bolder aside that film still has its compelling moments like princes tale scene no need tell about performances daniel radcliffe rupert grint emma watson rest cast because they are obviously good their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention that is alan rickman we already knew him as snape but there is one scene where we see more his character his performance was excellent filmmaking special effects is obviously good music score really made battle scenes epic perfect final film me its really hard write review about harry potter is it because i never read books or im not really huge fan but my opinion harry potter is successful series if i rank all movie conclusions this could be number three because nothing beats lord rings star wars either youre fan or not youll love this series yes this is another remarkable movie series,0.5361492673992674,0.19581043956043956,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8.0,A breathtaking finale to an amazing series,"Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off, the film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. Rather quickly, it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts, and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community, and the world at large, begins.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always, it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision, but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good, and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene. Grint, Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters, and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here, they have totally immersed themselves into their roles, and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book, and move from sadness, to courageous, to fearful, and more, with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong, and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from. Even with their varying screen times, the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall, as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (who gets the greatest line in the film). Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, George Harris, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters, and help deliver awesome performances all around.But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point, Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series, and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation, and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name, courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious, Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.But like all Harry Potter films however, the cohesive product is not without its faults.My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts, it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half, the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them, and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience, and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete, but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot, and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.My other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly, so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway, and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three-dimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon, there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal, never exploring the format, and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend. In what feels like a blink of the eye, the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived, and with it, an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book, but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans, and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the best film finales ever conceived. 8.5/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",breathtaking finale amazing series,moments after i saw very first trailer harry potter deathly hallows i was crawling with goosebumps plagued with anxiety after almost decade franchise was coming end i had already read book knew plotting remembered fates all characters but trailer left me near unfathomable state end was coming there was nothing i could do stop it picking up practically exact moment where first half left off film begins with harry daniel radcliffe ron rupert grint hermione emma watson still trail elusive horcruxes that make up voldemorts ralph fiennes soul rather quickly it becomes apparent that group will need travel back hogwarts it is there that final battle determine fate wizarding community world at large begins harry potter deathly hallows part 2 is fitting finale one best most consistent series past decade it is simply wondrous spectacle that extends concludes story wonderfully while story effects are just as great as always it is final battle we have all been waiting that delivers spades it is everything you imagined it would be more splitting films may still be debatable decision but film is able stand its own much same way previous part did it is that good that gripping it may be shortest harry potter film but it is also only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants navigate itself with each new scene grint watson especially radcliffe are simply stunning their performances they have grown up with these characters have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film but here they have totally immersed themselves into their roles results are nothing short magical they are exactly how you remember them written book move sadness courageous fearful more with such passion conviction that you forget they are simply acting their styles are that strong help provide emotional crux film leans never even with their varying screen times supporting cast is impeccable as always alan rickman is spectacular simply devastating as devious professor snape maggie smith finally gets some real time shine as professor mcgonagall as does julie walters as molly weasley who gets greatest line film jason isaacs helena bonham carter george harris tom felton michael gambon matthew lewis also perfect their characters help deliver awesome performances all around but supporting screen time is dominated by fiennes as voldemort when harry his friends are not focal point fiennes simply owns everyone his performance always ranked amongst best series he does not let finale slow him down he is horrifically evil his interpretation frequently compares his absolutely terrifyingly brilliant performance as amon goeth schindlers list fear that courses through characters veins at very sight or mention his name courses equally through audience even when he is being darkly hilarious fiennes is downright petrifying he is stuff that nightmares are made his work is just that close perfect role that it gives almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly but like all harry potter films however cohesive product is not without its faults my main gripe with film come out sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts it allowed some more useless careless sections prose make it into film much like extended excruciatingly long camping trip first half second half gets dragged down by addition standout moments book that felt awful first time you read them come off even worse screen i know they are pandering audience adding just as much as they possibly could make film feel complete but there was reason so much was cut out other books when they made leap big screen this is shortest saga by long shot chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out my other gripe is 3d filmmakers said they did not have right amount time convert first half properly so they just scrapped plans movie looked amazing anyway i found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three dimensional about it about second part save scene early involving rather badly rendered dragon there is not much else that takes advantage added 3d majority film just looks acts normal never exploring format never giving audience reason care or change their minds quickly dying trend what feels like blink eye harry potter film series is over harry potter deathly hallows part 2 has arrived with it incredible end franchise it stumbles some places because inane disappointing prose book but filmmakers have stayed true their book film fans delivered tremendously worthy finale it is one strongest films year one best film finales ever conceived 8 5 10 extended review also appeared,0.5160797586252132,0.18352984389348015,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"

,Jarndyce and Jarndyce,"I have read only a small portion from the books, but enough to understand the woman's approach. I have, however, attentively watched all the films. This comment applies to the entire saga with some attention to the final two.Charles Dickens invented a style of writing that is well suited to some kinds of cinematic adventure. What he would do is invent a world, and thoroughly understand its dynamics. These really were invented worlds, though today they appear as though he was writing about his own. He was an absolute genius at discovering certain objects and characters in these worlds and giving them powerful names. Then he would let his characters loose; he literally would write and publish the first episodes of what we read today as whole books. He would send the chapters out, trusting that his named entities would weave their own story. The result is pure joy when reading because the world is whole enough to carry us.It is also why his books all end clumsily.Rowling works very much in this style, the first chapters sent aloft while the story is still soft; the impressive ability to name things; the creation of a universe of sorts. As though she understands this, her alternative world is extended not from our modern technological one, but from Dickens' Victorian England. The filmmakers, starting with Columbus, understood this and adapted what they supposed we supposed were Victorian manners, costumes and architecture. The dragons are sourced not from modern models but from drawings of that period.So the strength is that we are sucked into the world. Usual offenses from clumsy plots, unnecessary events, artificially placed combat and all are made invisible because we care not about the story per se, but the world that supports it. We care less about any of the characters, than the names the carry. That is Dickens' gift. I do like a few names Rowling devised; they are worthy.Otherwise (meaning without the Victorian art, and Dickensian names) we may just as well be watching a Michael Bay film.The previous film had a folding device I appreciated. We are told a story that is supposed to be central, the story of the 'Deathly Hallows.' Now as it turns out, the three objects described in the story are not any more central than any of the other named objects, but we don't know that in the seventh film. The story is told in a shadow puppet form, one we have seen a couple times already this year. The level of abstraction is the same from the Harry Potter universe as that universe is from ours, which is why it matters in the end that Harry destroys one of the three objects.Previous films, starting with the fourth I believe, had the 'pensieve,' a clever device which allows Harry to see movies of the past. The dynamics of the thing are strange because they are supposed to be recreated memories, but the viewer sees them cinematically. We gloss over the difficulty just as we do with alien invaders speaking English. I did appreciate the design of this thing as it evolved in the films, but it retains the inkflows. That works well in combination with the inkflow-like trails of Voldemort's flying minions.Lily Evans as a redheaded girl is adorable.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",jarndyce jarndyce,i have read only small portion books but enough understand womans approach i have however attentively watched all films this comment applies entire saga with some attention final two charles dickens invented style writing that is well suited some kinds cinematic adventure what he would do is invent world thoroughly understand its dynamics these really were invented worlds though today they appear as though he was writing about his own he was absolute genius at discovering certain objects characters these worlds giving them powerful names then he would let his characters loose he literally would write publish first episodes what we read today as whole books he would send chapters out trusting that his named entities would weave their own story result is pure joy when reading because world is whole enough carry us it is also why his books all end clumsily rowling works very much this style first chapters sent aloft while story is still soft impressive ability name things creation universe sorts as though she understands this her alternative world is extended not our modern technological one but dickens victorian england filmmakers starting with columbus understood this adapted what they supposed we supposed were victorian manners costumes architecture dragons are sourced not modern models but drawings that period so strength is that we are sucked into world usual offenses clumsy plots unnecessary events artificially placed combat all are made invisible because we care not about story per se but world that supports it we care less about any characters than names carry that is dickens gift i do like few names rowling devised they are worthy otherwise meaning without victorian art dickensian names we may just as well be watching michael bay film previous film had folding device i appreciated we are told story that is supposed be central story deathly hallows now as it turns out three objects described story are not any more central than any other named objects but we dont know that seventh film story is told shadow puppet form one we have seen couple times already this year level abstraction is same harry potter universe as that universe is ours which is why it matters end that harry destroys one three objects previous films starting with fourth i believe had pensieve clever device which allows harry see movies past dynamics thing are strange because they are supposed be recreated memories but viewer sees them cinematically we gloss over difficulty just as we do with alien invaders speaking english i did appreciate design this thing as it evolved films but it retains inkflows that works well combination with inkflow like trails voldemorts flying minions lily evans as redheaded girl is adorable teds evaluation 3 3 worth watching,0.45722421808960284,0.08339708368554524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.57}"
8.0,Hogwarts Kids Are True To Their School,"Watching Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part 2 put me in mind of the old Beach Boys song about Be True To Your School. What these kids go through for the Alma Mater is definitely above and beyond for most of us, but all in a day's work for young wizards.At the end of Part 1, there's been a hostile takeover at Hogwarts Academy with perennial villain Alan Rickman the new headmaster. Michael Gambon has been killed and Daniel Radcliffe as protagonist Harry Potter along with two trusty sidekicks Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are in exile and seeking a way for an academic counterrevolution. That they succeed can be told to you by any of the millions of readers of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, but with a lot of interesting plot twists in which young Radcliffe learns a lot about himself and the very definite purpose he's been put on earth for.Though with the huge readership worldwide that the Harry Potter books enjoy, the only real criticism I can level at this or at most of the other films is that you really have to be immersed in Potter lore to know exactly what's going on. And that's bad if you missed a couple of the films when they were out as I did and still haven't made them up as yet.J.K. Rowling ended her series and this should end the series with public acclaim intact and fan base satisfied.

8.0,A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series...,"HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part 2 moves forward where it left off with Dobby's death toward a stunning conclusion with the final violent confrontation between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The richly crafted characters bring a lot of warmth and humor between all of the tense situations, which makes the whole project such a delight to watch.However satisfying the conclusion is, winding up the tale nineteen years later with a grown-up Potter and friends seeing their children off to Hogwart, I found some discomfort in the decision to play many key scenes in almost complete darkness. I repeat here what I said in my review of Part 1: ""Many of the 'dark' scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt."" Still, I think the contrast between light and dark was ""off"" once again in the DVD transfer and too many scenes are underlit and obscured by bad lighting techniques.Having said that, the performances are all first-rate, with all of the British thespians doing fantastic jobs in both leading and pivotal roles. But the standout among all the players is Alan Rickman as ""Snape."" His character is revealed to be much more than the one-dimensional man he seemed to be in earlier chapters. He speaks every word with great authority. And, of course, the other standout is Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, hissing his lines in a threatening manner accompanied everywhere by a slithering snake. Seeing him get his comeuppance is one of the major satisfactions in the whole story.An almost unrecognizable Ciaran Hinds turns up as Aberforth Dumbledore, one of the many ""surprises"" among the supporting players. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do their usual ensemble playing with finesse, embodying their characters more completely than ever.Alexandre Desplat's background score is stirring whether it's being forceful or gentle and is a pleasure to listen to under the closing credits.Summing up: A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series.",very satisfying conclusion epic series,harry potter deathly hallows part 2 moves forward where it left off with dobbys death toward stunning conclusion with final violent confrontation between harry lord voldemort richly crafted characters bring lot warmth humor between all tense situations which makes whole project such delight watch however satisfying conclusion is winding up tale nineteen years later with grown up potter friends seeing their children off hogwart i found some discomfort decision play many key scenes almost complete darkness i repeat here what i said my review part 1 many dark scenes are too dark eye comfort but then whole story has dark atmosphere brooding impending evil about erupt still i think contrast between light dark was off once again dvd transfer too many scenes are underlit obscured by bad lighting techniques having said that performances are all first rate with all british thespians doing fantastic jobs both leading pivotal roles but standout among all players is alan rickman as snape his character is revealed be much more than one dimensional man he seemed be earlier chapters he speaks every word with great authority course other standout is ralph fiennes as lord voldemort hissing his lines threatening manner accompanied everywhere by slithering snake seeing him get his comeuppance is one major satisfactions whole story almost unrecognizable ciaran hinds turns up as aberforth dumbledore one many surprises among supporting players daniel radcliffe emma watson rupert grint do their usual ensemble playing with finesse embodying their characters more completely than ever alexandre desplats background score is stirring whether its being forceful or gentle is pleasure listen under closing credits summing up very satisfying conclusion epic series,0.5575581395348836,0.13323643410852715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,Wizard ending,"Knowing in advance both how the story goes (and with J K Rowling on board as a co- producer, that it wasn't going to be changed much) and naturally how it ends, it was incumbent on Peter Yates to nonetheless deliver the big finish to Harry's adventures and in particular his final showdown with Voldemort. I wasn't disappointed and in the end had only minor quibbles about the resolution.The dark atmosphere from Part 1 is continued with the action mostly played out in scenes of brooding darkness and to the background of weighty soundtrack music. There is noticeably less of Hermione and Ron, which is only right given the necessary one-on-one fight with Voldemort at the conclusion. While that duel, with shades of Holmes and Moriarty, was always going to be the climax here, I enjoyed the build-up to it, with the escape from Gringotts, Snape's revelatory Pensieve memories, Harry's supernatural interviews with Rowena Ravenclaw (and Dumbledore), plus of course the blowing-up of Hogwarts all contributing to the excitement and anticipation.Rowling herself has stated that from the first, she had a clear vision of Harry and Voldemort's final reckoning with both of them circling each other in a blasted landscape and this was exactly what was delivered. I did however feel confused if not cheated as to how the Elder wand reverted to Harry, when all along Voldemort had made such a strong claim for it, but still the Evil Lord's demise was spectacularly satisfying when it came.My only other carps were the pointless inclusion of the 19-years-on epilogue, which added nothing and detracted from the high point achieved with the death of Voldemort (I know it's in the book, but it told us nothing important - as if we didn't know they were all going to live happily ever), the abbreviated round-up afforded different characters from previous episodes, especially Hagrid, the Weasley parents and Jim Broadbent's character, plus it can't be denied that the three main characters by now seem too a little old for their parts (although it's not their fault that the time needed to create such large-scale movies by- passed their characters' natural time-lines) and my old caveat that too many of the supporting parts were played by too-familiar faces from British acting royalty (it's a wonder Judi Dench didn't get a look in).But in the whole this was fantastic entertainment and a worthy finish to the saga, which I hope they don't spoil by rebooting sometime in the future.",wizard ending,knowing advance both how story goes with j k rowling board as co producer that it wasnt going be changed much naturally how it ends it was incumbent peter yates nonetheless deliver big finish harrys adventures particular his final showdown with voldemort i wasnt disappointed end had only minor quibbles about resolution dark atmosphere part 1 is continued with action mostly played out scenes brooding darkness background weighty soundtrack music there is noticeably less hermione ron which is only right given necessary one one fight with voldemort at conclusion while that duel with shades holmes moriarty was always going be climax here i enjoyed build up it with escape gringotts snapes revelatory pensieve memories harrys supernatural interviews with rowena ravenclaw dumbledore plus course blowing up hogwarts all contributing excitement anticipation rowling herself has stated that first she had clear vision harry voldemorts final reckoning with both them circling each other blasted landscape this was exactly what was delivered i did however feel confused if not cheated as how elder wand reverted harry when all along voldemort had made such strong claim it but still evil lords demise was spectacularly satisfying when it came my only other carps were pointless inclusion 19 years epilogue which added nothing detracted high point achieved with death voldemort i know its book but it told us nothing important as if we didnt know they were all going live happily ever abbreviated round up afforded different characters previous episodes especially hagrid weasley parents jim broadbents character plus it cant be denied that three main characters by now seem too little old their parts although its not their fault that time needed create such large scale movies by passed their characters natural time lines my old caveat that too many supporting parts were played by too familiar faces british acting royalty its wonder judi dench didnt get look but whole this was fantastic entertainment worthy finish saga which i hope they dont spoil by rebooting sometime future,0.5397398589065253,0.06328142536475871,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.55}"

8.0,"Action packed, genuine heart and emotional drama made this movie, a very engrossing magical epic spectacle. It has everything, a finale should have.","While, personally, I'm not the biggest fan of the books in which these films was based on, I do have to say, this movie is a great movie to end the Harry Potter film series with. 10 points to Griffindor & director David Yates! Author J.K Rowling would be proud. The movie is very memorable. It's so unlike the other movies, which I found to be somewhat boring or below average. For me, personally, this movie, by far, is the best movie in the 2001 to 2011 film series, because how entertaining, it was. To all of the millions of Harry Potter fans around the world; most of them, agree with my statement. Unlike the other movies that are cut into two formulaic plot directions; one being the subplot is which tells the student life of Harry Potter at Hogwarts, while the other, being about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. This most recent one has Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his gang of misfits, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) & Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) going to various settings away from Hogwarts, in a last ditch attempt to their school from the oncoming invasion of Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The only way, they can stop this, is to find, all the missing objects call Horcruxes; that hold a part of a Voldermont's soul, protecting him or her from death. Seeing how epic in scope, this main plot is, it was no surprised that this 2007's novel with the same name, was adapted into two feature-length parts, with Part 1, being released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011. While, some people might have complaints about why the final book being split, I'm not one of those. However, I'm starting to hate the recent trends of films, split into multiple parts; in which this movie brought back. Still, I do understand why the studios felt like they had to. After all, there is still way too exposition sub-stories from supporting characters from the book to fit, even in two films. Despite the film omitting a lot of things, the movie is stil mostly faithful to the source material, with only a few things, change that I didn't like. One of the biggest faults of the film is how both young and old Lily Evans (Ellie Darcey-Alden & Geraldine Somerville) doesn't have the same eye color as Harry Potters. The reason why this is a big deal, is because how much, everybody in the film series, point out how Harry Potter remind them of his mother, because of his eyes. It makes no sense. Another big jarring confusing plot-holes, is how wizards, can or cannot being able to use, other people's wands. In the film, one thing that really baffled me, is how Voldermont thinks that he can't use the elder wand, until he kills Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Yet, it's show, before-then, that he can indeed use that wand to do magic and other people's wand. The same with Harry Potter. It's weird, how the film makes it seem like they can't do magic without a wand, but yet, they show, them, just doing that with potions. Also, why does people still die in this universe, if Harry Potter has all of the three deadly hallows? Oh Snap! Didn't they establish that one of the wizards knows, how to heal himself with magic, if it's a bleeding wound? How is that character, even dead? Also, how can a living object become a horcrux? It doesn't make sense. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. The movie is full of unbelievable, deux ex machina that is very confusing, and not very logical. You just have to go with it. Nevertheless, I still don't get, why this movie is continuing its insulting black & white one-dimensional views of good Vs evil. A good example in this movie, is how everybody still treat Slytherin's house as an evil community of people, when the movie show that, there are mostly not!? Another thing, that bug me, is the fact, that the underage students weren't evacuated from Hogswarts. I guess, the school is trying to continue, its high death count record of being one of the most dangerous schools, ever. I swear, it always seems like the castle is always in danger. So, I wouldn't call the battle plot, anything new. It is very clichés and prediction. Despite that, the battle sequences are well done. Visual and special effects masterpiece. Lots of heart-breaking, yet fun moments. The music by composter John Williams really set the tone of the film, as always. The pacing for this film is also not a drag. Very well-pace. It's the shortest of all 9 films. The main cast was surprising better, too. Yes, they still, have that wooden delivery in some of their lines, but at least, it's more emotional driven than a normal read-through. Also, the over the top hammy lines by the season actors weren't so annoying this time, because how few lines, they were given. However, I didn't like the Epilogue ending as much as other people did. I can understand why a lot of people don't like it; in a way it feels a bit jumbled because so many characters of this new generation are introduced too quickly, and it's a bit much to take in. I personally am not too keen on the idea. It felt like sequel baiting. After all, it's clear, by Warner Bros that we haven't seen the last of this world completely, as spin-offs movies are indeed, coming soon. Overall: In the meantime, I urge you all to revisit the world of Harry Potter for yourself. Check out all 9 movies. It will be a trip, worth taking.",action packed genuine heart emotional drama made this movie very engrossing magical epic spectacle it has everything finale should have,while personally im not biggest fan books which these films was based i do have say this movie is great movie end harry potter film series with 10 points griffindor director david yates author j k rowling would be proud movie is very memorable its so unlike other movies which i found be somewhat boring or below average me personally this movie by far is best movie 2001 2011 film series because how entertaining it was all millions harry potter fans around world most them agree with my statement unlike other movies that are cut into two formulaic plot directions one being subplot is which tells student life harry potter at hogwarts while other being about mystery that harry potter must uncovered that year this most recent one has harry potter daniel radcliffe his gang misfits hermione granger emma watson ron weasley rupert grint going various settings away hogwarts last ditch attempt their school oncoming invasion dark lord voldemort ralph fiennes only way they can stop this is find all missing objects call horcruxes that hold part voldermonts soul protecting him or her death seeing how epic scope this main plot is it was no surprised that this 2007s novel with same name was adapted into two feature length parts with part 1 being released november 2010 part 2 was released july 2011 while some people might have complaints about why final book being split im not one those however im starting hate recent trends films split into multiple parts which this movie brought back still i do understand why studios felt like they had after all there is still way too exposition sub stories supporting characters book fit even two films despite film omitting lot things movie is stil mostly faithful source material with only few things change that i didnt like one biggest faults film is how both young old lily evans ellie darcey alden geraldine somerville doesnt have same eye color as harry potters reason why this is big deal is because how much everybody film series point out how harry potter remind them his mother because his eyes it makes no sense another big jarring confusing plot holes is how wizards can or cannot being able use other peoples wands film one thing that really baffled me is how voldermont thinks that he cant use elder wand until he kills professor severus snape alan rickman yet its show before then that he can indeed use that wand do magic other peoples wand same with harry potter its weird how film makes it seem like they cant do magic without wand but yet they show them just doing that with potions also why does people still die this universe if harry potter has all three deadly hallows oh snap didnt they establish that one wizards knows how heal himself with magic if its bleeding wound how is that character even dead also how can living object become horcrux it doesnt make sense my opinion dont bother trying understand logic all wizard terms because it will take you out fantasy movie give you headache movie is full unbelievable deux ex machina that is very confusing not very logical you just have go with it nevertheless i still dont get why this movie is continuing its insulting black white one dimensional views good vs evil good example this movie is how everybody still treat slytherins house as evil community people when movie show that there are mostly not another thing that bug me is fact that underage students werent evacuated hogswarts i guess school is trying continue its high death count record being one most dangerous schools ever i swear it always seems like castle is always danger so i wouldnt call battle plot anything new it is very clich s prediction despite that battle sequences are well done visual special effects masterpiece lots heart breaking yet fun moments music by composter john williams really set tone film as always pacing this film is also not drag very well pace its shortest all 9 films main cast was surprising better too yes they still have that wooden delivery some their lines but at least its more emotional driven than normal read through also over top hammy lines by season actors werent so annoying this time because how few lines they were given however i didnt like epilogue ending as much as other people did i can understand why lot people dont like it way it feels bit jumbled because so many characters this new generation are introduced too quickly its bit much take i personally am not too keen idea it felt like sequel baiting after all its clear by warner bros that we havent seen last this world completely as spin offs movies are indeed coming soon overall meantime i urge you all revisit world harry potter yourself check out all 9 movies it will be trip worth taking,0.45972006766818074,0.07767656871430458,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,Too Bad It Ended Like This,"OVerall it was okay, and will make a bunch of money. But David Yates was not the best to direct the Potter films. His method always seems to be to just get through the movie as quick as possible. This has been true since OOTP. The problem is that such a quick pace leaves out many key scenes and doesn't allow the viewer to make more of an emotional investment in the story and the characters. Deathly Hallows 2 was no different. It was enjoyable enough, I suppose. But could have been so much better with just an additional 10 minutes of movie. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion.Spoiler alert: Just some scenes that could have been added or extended: Snapes memories- a few more scenes to greater establish his closeness with Lilly and his role in fighting Voldemort. It would have helped to explain why Harry named one of his kids after a man he had hated for 7 years. And a few more lines to show his reluctance to have to be the one to kill Dumbledore. This would have shown Snapes greater respect and love for him.Slightly extend the scene leading up to Mrs. Weasley fighting Belatrix. A few more seconds to establish Jinny's peril in the fight before Mrs. Weasly stepping in and uttering her great line. IT happened so fast, you could miss that Jinny was even fighting Belatrix if you blink at the wrong time.SHould have shown the death of Fred and Percy's reuniting with the family. This wouldn't have taken very long and Fred deserved to have his death scene, rather than just being an afterthought body on a stretcher.SHould have shown a few more individual fight sequences, especially with Hagrid. I was beginning to wonder if Hagrid was even going to appear. And there was no emotion from him when he thought Harry was dead.Extend the scene of Mrs. Malfoy and Harry to better explain why she lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead.Should have shown more entities involved in the fight, like parents, Hogsmead residence, the elves as lead by Kreacher - rather than showing mainly an army of kids fighting the Death Eaters.MOre of the school's teachers in the fight.The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort could have been done better and stayed truer to the book.OVer all, Yates' Harry Potter movies have been rather emotionless and anti-climatic.

5.0,Am I the only one to be disappointed??? ***spoilerrific***,"Yeah. I came out of the film disappointed. Not feeling like I had a good time.Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie. But there are things that brought it down and too many of them for it to be forgivable.1) Dumbledore's brother and sister. You know what I mean. Referred to and never followed upon.2) The kiss. Didn't happen in the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, did the Chamber scene happen at all? In the book, it happens after Ron expresses concern for the welfare of the elves (in light of Dobby's heroic death) in the outbreak of a fire at Hogwarts. Here, it is given to you as a variation of the ""We're alive! Let's kiss!"" movie cliché'.3) Fred's death should have been on screen. Period.4) The Avada Kedavra curse didn't make bodies disintergrate. Until Voldemort (and perhaps Bellatrix, too?). What? 5) The roles of Matthew Lewis and Evanna Lynch (Neville and Luna respectively) were enough to warrant their names as part of the supporting cast. To only see their names in the full cast is scandalous to say the least.(And, yes, I am aware two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gets the same treatment. I know she makes two small appearances, but again, she has two bloody Oscars! Either she is very humble or she needs a better agent.) 6) They really should have stuck with the CGI aging.
