7.0,"""Yeah. Ooh-ah, that's how it always starts.""","I guess I'll have to put this one under my guilty pleasures department. I've always been a sucker for dinosaurs, and with the filming technology available today, a film like this one and it's predecessor have just the right ingredients for a fun time. Granted, there are many elements in the story here that don't make a whole lot of sense, but there's that old saying about suspending disbelief, so that's what I'm applying here.Besides all the puzzling plot elements, and you know what most of them are, here's one I picked up in an early scene. When Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) looks at the wall map showing 'Las Cinco Muertes', The Five Deaths, the island of Isla Sorna is at the center of that cluster. In the opening screen narrative it's stated that this island is eighty seven miles southwest of Isla Nublar, but none of the other islands on the map go by that name. So a bit of a continuity slip-up there.You know what I got a kick out of? At one point, one of the principal characters upon arriving on the island, states that the Eisenberg Uncertainty Principle is in effect, that is, it's not possible to study something without changing it. That was oddly reminiscent of the original Star Trek Prime Directive; an interesting concept but virtually impossible to maintain, because once you're there, your actions have consequences.Say, and how about that Roland (Pete Postlethwaite), is he a Nascar contender or what? Recall when the InGen team first arrive on Isla Sorna and he's driving on the jungle trails with Ludlow (Arliss Howard). I had to rewind the scene because he had his head turned completely around to Ludlow in the back seat for a full forty seconds at one point - how did he do that? Well anyway, not a lot of credibility to the picture, but how can you not marvel at the imaginative CGI work creating those magnificent dinosaurs? Stego's, T-Rex's and all those mini-predators make for a couple hours of dino fun. You don't even have to pay attention to the scientists.",yeah ooh ah thats how it always starts,i guess ill have put this one under my guilty pleasures department ive always been sucker dinosaurs with filming technology available today film like this one its predecessor have just right ingredients fun time granted there are many elements story here that dont make whole lot sense but theres that old saying about suspending disbelief so thats what im applying here besides all puzzling plot elements you know what most them are heres one i picked up early scene when kelly vanessa lee chester looks at wall map showing las cinco muertes five deaths island isla sorna is at center that cluster opening screen narrative its stated that this island is eighty seven miles southwest isla nublar but none other islands map go by that name so bit continuity slip up there you know what i got kick out at one point one principal characters upon arriving island states that eisenberg uncertainty principle is effect that is its not possible study something without changing it that was oddly reminiscent original star trek prime directive interesting concept but virtually impossible maintain because once youre there your actions have consequences say how about that roland pete postlethwaite is he nascar contender or what recall when ingen team first arrive isla sorna hes driving jungle trails with ludlow arliss howard i had rewind scene because he had his head turned completely around ludlow back seat full forty seconds at one point how did he do that well anyway not lot credibility picture but how can you not marvel at imaginative cgi work creating those magnificent dinosaurs stegos t rexs all those mini predators make couple hours dino fun you dont even have pay attention scientists,0.5297619047619048,0.14676190476190476,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,Part II.,"Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned...Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters; the twist toward the end is surprising and entertaining, though some poor editing leaves a big plot hole aboard the discovered freighter...still, a worthy sequel that holds up today.",part ii,steven spielberg returned direct this sequel loosely based michael crichton novel that sees jeff goldblum returning as dr ian malcolm who is enlisted by john hammond richard attenborough again return jurassic park though previously unmentioned site b study dinosaur population also rescue another team which includes former flame his played by julianne moore he reluctantly agrees after locating her finds their disgust that company ingen has allowed hunting parties take place where big game hunters led by pete postlethwaite stalk kill dinosaurs though tables would course be turned good sequel has equally effective f x terrifying story though few too many characters twist toward end is surprising entertaining though some poor editing leaves big plot hole aboard discovered freighter still worthy sequel that holds up today,0.45224358974358975,0.07435897435897434,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,A good follow-up,"I really enjoy this movie. It's not as good as the first movie, but it is hard to top Jurassic Park. And not many sequels surpass their predecessors anyway. It's good time for everyone.This movie is about Jurassic Park, the sequel. It turns out that dinosaurs were also kept on another island, where they were born and raised for a short time before being moved to the official park island. But when a research team go to capture them on camera and simply observe them, bad things happen. Whilst another team comes with bad intentions that get almost everyone hurt.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Great.",good follow up,i really enjoy this movie its not as good as first movie but it is hard top jurassic park not many sequels surpass their predecessors anyway its good time everyone this movie is about jurassic park sequel it turns out that dinosaurs were also kept another island where they were born raised short time before being moved official park island but when research team go capture them camera simply observe them bad things happen whilst another team comes with bad intentions that get almost everyone hurt overall i give this movie 7 out 10 which my ratings book is great,0.49396258503401363,0.1505952380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.18}"
8.0,Very good,"Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.",very good,not quite as good as first one only because several first movie cast was not it sam neill laura dern are two that come mind this is still excellent movie jeff golblum is back as doctor ian malcolm does his usual good job his character is still insightful more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well julianne moore plays very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested animals than her own survival at least at times one not so good guys that are also this island if hunter played by pete postlethwaite he is there protection but his personal objective is bag big one well it turns out he gets bagged,0.5089393939393939,0.3140909090909091,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.39, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,Defending an Underrated Sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park,"I still don't get the hate for The Lost World: Jurassic Park and the love for Jurassic Park III? Can Someone explain to me why is III in your opinion so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park is? In my opinion III lacks on the story and is not terrible because Steven Spielberg did not Direct the movie but it is terrible because the whole movie makes no damn sense it is too short, it lacks on the story and is really awful to me. It has no character development in III at all and lying to Dr. Grant and trick him on that island is just inhuman and awful. And Why is Jurassic World so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park? I am sorry is not better than the second movie. In my opinion is not, but is at least better than Jurassic Lark III is but is not any better over The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997).An Underrated classic sequel in the series and the last movie directed by Steven Spielberg. I have enjoyed this movie much better than Jurassic Park III and Jurassic World. The movie is very bashed and criticized by their fans of the first film. Just like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom this is the sequel that is very bashed from critics and fans again. This is the first and unfortunately last great sequel to the original Jurassic Park. I think Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore did a good job on there performances. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is like Godzilla T-Rex in San Diego. I still love This movie a very underrated science fiction/action sequel film in The Jurassic Park entry franchise. I think for it's sequel it had a good start running. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is loosely based on Michael Crichton's 1995 novel The Lost World.The film won 1 award for Best Effects and Visual Effects. Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it:The daughter of Ian is black in here,which makes to me no sense since Ian is white. Vince Vaughn was unnecessary to cast him and unneeded. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn,this is a science fiction/Action film not a comedy Vince get this in your head! Vince stole Roland Tembo bullets for his shot gun and with that action Vince jeopardized and put whole people in the camp in the mortal danger and T-Rex come after them and eat bunch of people cause of him. Roland could shot the T-Rex and save people and because of Vince's action he couldn't. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn for this. I am glad he was cut by the end of the film.Peter Stormare/Compys sequences from swarm of Compsognathus knock him and killing him were really unnecessary and unneeded etc.), plus it has a sluggish pace and such.Baby T-Rex in this movie was extremely annoying and his yelling in the trailer and in the car it annoyed me so much and on end of the movie.Thing's I love in this movie: T-Rex dinosaur in a city San Diego, the chase and eating people in the city are awesome. Ian and Sarah drive to the amphitheater harbor and pick up the infant. They make sure they bait the creature with its infant and drive back to the docks and place the infant in the cargo hold of the ship.Sarah prepares a sedative dart and shoots the T. Rex as Malcolm closes the cargo hold door, trapping the animals inside. Awesome! Surviving hunters travel through an open field of tall grass. Ajay tries to warn them, shouting ""DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS!"" but none of them listens and are killed one by one by Velociraptors.Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo as famous animal hunter was awesome, I seriously I love the actor and his character, He came to Isla Sorna along with his hunting partner, Ajay Sidhu, in hopes of gaining the ultimate trophy and not for the money a male T. Rex.He survived in this movie. A shame a good actor Pete Postlethwaite died 4.years ago and he is not with us anymore. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park (1993) and Julianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding did a good job on there performances.Returning of John Hammond his nephews Tim and Lex the same actors from Jurassic park (1993). Tim and Lex had a brief cameo but John did had a cameo on the end of the movie. Daughter Kelly to do some a gymnastics and kick a little raptor trough the window was really a bad ass awesome.Cgi and the film effects wasn't that bad either they were really good. John Williams did return as music composer and he did return with his theme music score. Like its predecessor, The Lost World: Jurassic Park was scored by famed composer John Williams (a longtime collaborator with director Steven Spielberg).John Williams didn't write a stereotypical sequel score, but instead developed a wildly different style for the different location, cast, and darker tone of the second Jurassic Park film.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 American science fiction adventure film. It is the second installment in the Jurassic Park film series. A sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park.I love Jurassic Park (1993) as everyone do but I also love The Lost World: Jurassic Park.

7.0,Entertaining and unbelievable,"As entertaining, and as unbelievable, as the first is Spielberg's return to rampant, DNA induced Dino's, ""The Lost World"".I guess a sequel was inevitable, as is the final twenty minutes of this film. Surprises are supplied in the script, yet most of the action sequences lack imagination. Only the very early scenes impress, the initial encounters being at times thrilling, especially the scene in which the T-Rex's shove twin trailers over a cliff.Special effects again take the limelight, but we've seen it all before, so the affect is diminished. John Williams score makes a welcome return, and his aural composition is supported by great cinematography.Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) returns from ""Jurassic Park"", and is now the hero of the moment. Goldblum plays well the mathematician who is decidedly unenthusiastic about being among the deadly dinosaurs. Much more keen is his new g.f., played by the likable Julianne Moore. She is the palaeontologist who volunteers to observe the dinosaurs in their natural habitat and make recordings for entrepreneur Sir Richard Attenborough. Vince Vaughn forms part of this passive group. Heading up an opposing, aggressive band who plan to capture and export the beasts is Pete Postlethwaite, portraying most enjoyably the great white hunter who longs to stalk a male T-Rex.Leave it to Spielberg to recreate the excitement, drama and thrills of the first film. A shame about the closing thirty minutes though.Sunday, July 13, 1997 - Knox District Centre",entertaining unbelievable,as entertaining as unbelievable as first is spielbergs return rampant dna induced dinos lost world i guess sequel was inevitable as is final twenty minutes this film surprises are supplied script yet most action sequences lack imagination only very early scenes impress initial encounters being at times thrilling especially scene which t rexs shove twin trailers over cliff special effects again take limelight but weve seen it all before so affect is diminished john williams score makes welcome return his aural composition is supported by great cinematography dr malcolm jeff goldblum returns jurassic park is now hero moment goldblum plays well mathematician who is decidedly unenthusiastic about being among deadly dinosaurs much more keen is his new g f played by likable julianne moore she is palaeontologist who volunteers observe dinosaurs their natural habitat make recordings entrepreneur sir richard attenborough vince vaughn forms part this passive group heading up opposing aggressive band who plan capture export beasts is pete postlethwaite portraying most enjoyably great white hunter who longs stalk male t rex leave it spielberg recreate excitement drama thrills first film shame about closing thirty minutes though sunday july 13 1997 knox district centre,0.5882459515792849,0.23235209235209234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,Mommy's very angry......,"With the apparent public discovery of the 'Site B' production island full of dinosaurs, John Hammond assembles a team to visit and document the area before it is exploited by others.Included in the four man team are Dr. Ian Malcolm and his girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding.When the team reaches the island, they soon discover the presence of another group of people. This new group however are not there for biological data but instead have something more sinister in mind.After a series of events, both groups become stranded when all their communication equipment is lost.It is then that the terror really begins as both groups scramble for their lives....If ever there was going to be a sequel to a movie, this had to be the one, but the title should have been 'The cool one from Jurassic Park, has his own movie!!'.And while it's nowhere near as good as the first movie, and even though it has some silly moments, and is a tad overlong, it's still a gripping movie.The Spielberg magic is still there, it's evident when Moore is laying on the pane of glass and it's cracking, and the grass paths being formed by the Velociraptors in their opening scene.But obviously the film has many flaws, Vince Vaughn, he's annoying, and then just vanishes before the final act. Goldblum is the star, but it looks like his job here is to say something funny every now and again, moan, and do that thing he did in the original and Independence Day where something happens and he spouts a line (think 'Checkmate').Postlethwaite is the best thing here, but his subplot is way overlong and completely out of context with the rest of the film.The final act is good, but doesn't carry the oomph factor we were all expecting.So all in all it's a fine movie, not the best sequel in the world, but not as bad as the critics make it out to be.",mommys very angry,with apparent public discovery site b production island full dinosaurs john hammond assembles team visit document area before it is exploited by others included four man team are dr ian malcolm his girlfriend dr sarah harding when team reaches island they soon discover presence another group people this new group however are not there biological data but instead have something more sinister mind after series events both groups become stranded when all their communication equipment is lost it is then that terror really begins as both groups scramble their lives if ever there was going be sequel movie this had be one but title should have been cool one jurassic park has his own movie while its nowhere near as good as first movie even though it has some silly moments is tad overlong its still gripping movie spielberg magic is still there its evident when moore is laying pane glass its cracking grass paths being formed by velociraptors their opening scene but obviously film has many flaws vince vaughn hes annoying then just vanishes before final act goldblum is star but it looks like his job here is say something funny every now again moan do that thing he did original independence day where something happens he spouts line think checkmate postlethwaite is best thing here but his subplot is way overlong completely out context with rest film final act is good but doesnt carry oomph factor we were all expecting so all all its fine movie not best sequel world but not as bad as critics make it out be,0.6215404040404042,0.13926767676767676,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,Here Come the Money Shots!!,"Here comes the sequel to an epic. Steven Spielberg is back and what we get is a mixed bag. I saw it as a kid and naturally loved it. But as we grow older, so do our knowledge and need for probing. Some cast members did not return and weren't even referenced to at all in the story but other aspects in this film make up for it. Jeff Goldblum does reprise his role and I'm quite happy about that. Julian Moore and Vince Vaughn star here, but to me the actor who really caught my eye was Pete Postlethwaite, as Roland. In terms of story this film was definitely built as a thriller. A lot of the story is non-sensible, as I'm sure you've read. The boat somehow guiding itself back to the exact spot where it was destined via no pilot (or maybe auto-pilot), an experienced mercenary on an island full of flesh-eating dinosaurs wandering off just to take a leak, with Juan listening to his MP3 trying to catch a baby dinosaur when I'm sure you heard its enraged father is right behind himeh, the list goes on give or take. Basically this purely a money-shot type of film. We do see a bit of a deeper side to Goldblum's character and that does add a bit of zest to it all. A lot of the other characters are mildly gone into, just barely enough to get a sense of who they are. But suckers like me to this day end up caring for them. Ha-ha Decent characterization at best.Once again a riveting score by John Willams, but in all fairness we get no real time to appreciate it. The SFX of course good as can possibly be, but we established that in the first movie. In America what movie doesn't have good SFX? That's why I don't care when people say Godzilla films SFX are terrible. Because I LOVE dinosaurs I give it a 7.9, around a near B-, but no doubt still a keeper by far.

As a kid I just really found this film to be mesmerizing, exciting and entertaining. Watching it now I still found it to be a enthralling and fun movie to watch. The plot is coherent and the sense of action and excitement with the story is put together very well. There is a lot of good ideas and settings when it comes to the dinosaurs and human interactions and action sequences. It all melds together in the good old fashion Spielberg style. To the point it was thrilling from beginning to end. Most of the characters was coherent with the story and it was nice to see Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) as the main lead this time around, since he was a likable character in the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie.

7.0,Something has survived......,"The first movie and the novel it was based on were masterpieces of film and literature. Sadly the same can not be said for the second film. This is one example of where the movie is actually better then the novel. The Lost World by Michael Crichton was a good novel but nowhere near as exciting or as adventurous as the original.The movie sequel improves it, but not by much. Actors such as Jeff Goldblum (who is always great), Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlewaite all put on amazing performances. But the rest of the movie drags on in so many places. The movie could have been cut in sequences and made shorter as it would have allowed the pace to continue on more.The special effects were amazing as were some of the stunt sequences involved. As cool as it was to see the T-Rex play havoc in San Diego at the end, it was not really needed. They could have ended it a different way back in the island.Steven Spielberg had even gone on record saying this was an inferior film to the original. And he is right.

8.0,A moodier take on an instant classic,"Despite having perhaps one of the worst sequel titles in film history, The Lost World: Jurassic Park winds up being a favorable dinosaur outing. One of the pleasant things about the Jurassic Park franchise is that dinosaur films are few and far between, which allows for the ideas and sequences in these films to remain mostly fresh. There's little interference with ""been there, done that"" responses to action setpieces, nor is there a general cynicism to the tones of these films or the imagery (which gets especially moodier in this film). The wonder and elements of peril are still firmly instilled in Spielberg's direction and David Koepp's screenplay, making for a film that continues to really emphasize the thrill of its predecessor through nearly every scene.We focus on Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is hired by InGen CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to document the activities of the dinosaurs on Hammond's second Jurassic Park site after the terrible breakdown of his first site before financiers close the second park. Initially apprehensive, Malcolm turns compliant when he sees his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) packed up and ready to go, in addition to his daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) from his first marriage. On the trip, Malcolm winds up meeting an ecological film crew run by Vince Vaughn's Nick as well as a famous hunter known as Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite). As expected, however, the same catastrophe that occurred in the first park repeats itself with the second, making for a frightening and dangerous experience for the long-suffering individuals who recall Jurassic Park's initial failure all too well.The sole thing The Lost World does better than its predecessor is give us a group of more interesting characters and character actors. Seeing Goldblum, Moore, and Vaughn work off one another in a way that channels misfit tendencies very nicely is something to relish, for seeing all these actors in such a goofy, fun-loving project makes the price of admission already worth it. This band of characters, while still not entirely fleshed out, is still a lot better than the marginally amusing cast of characters from the first movie, which benefited largely from the effortless charisma of the everyman Wayne Knight.Still instilled in The Lost World from the original Jurassic Park film is the film's desire to keep us feeling constant danger and uncertainty. Jurassic Park's main attraction, besides state-of-the-art special effects, was the fact that it always made us feel at the mercy of enormous, hulking dinosaurs, regardless of where we tried to hide (or where the camera place us). Spielberg clearly capitalizes on this principle with this particular film, giving us the feeling of minimal safety he did with not only this film's predecessor, but his other projects like Duel and Poltergeist.Then there's the element of darkness in this film that's significantly more present here than it was in the first film. Rather than encapsulating the common attributes of flashy, summer blockbusters, The Lost World finds itself assuming a moodier state of mind, actively showing innocent bystanders consumed by dinosaurs, young people mauled by baby dinosaurs, and more. There's a flood of action and suspenseful sequences that really amount to some fully realized events in this film. Consider the scene when Kelly performs a complex gymnastics routine to save Malcolm and Sarah, or when the dinosaurs are attacking the film crew and Malcolm works to rescue them.In some ways, The Lost World finds ways to be more engaging than Jurassic Park. Its moodier style further exploits the dangers of dinosaurs, and the repeated peril that humans face when trying to assimilate to their world. The Lost World: Jurassic Park continues to affirm this frightening realization while remaining a thrilling piece of blockbuster entertainment, never squandering the opportunity to be dark and violent but also peppering in the occasional one-liner (some funny, some cringe-worthy) for good measure. Much like its predecessor, this is ultimately a variation on the summer blockbuster done well and in a consistently enjoyable manner.Starring: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vanessa Lee Chester, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Richard Attenborough.

9.0,"Supremely Thrilling, Suspenseful, and Visually Breathtaking, The Lost World is a Summer Blockbuster Sequel Done Right","The Lost World: Jurassic Park, the sequel to Steven Spielberg's iconic blockbuster, was released to massive commercial success, but critical disappointment. While audiences flocked to see the follow-up to the highest grossing movie of all-time, critics lambasted the movie for failing to live up to the high mark set by its groundbreaking predecessor. I'm here to set the record straight. The critics were demonstrably wrong. The Lost World is one of the most underrated, and over-hated movies of recent memory. Four years after Jurassic Park captivated audiences around the world, Steven Spielberg returned to the director's chair to craft a sequel that matched the original in every area that mattered. The Lost World is as technically accomplished, as thrilling, and as exquisitely crafted as the highly praised, Jurassic Park. Critics be damned!Michael Crichton's sequel novel serves as inspiration for The Lost World's story, which introduces Isla Sorna, or Site B, as its main setting. This island is the site where Jurassic Park's dinosaurs were bred and raised. After the events of Jurassic Park, the site was abandoned and dinosaurs roam free once again, in a proverbial ""lost world"". Ian Malcolm, the neurotic chaotician from the first film, is the centerpiece figure of The Lost World, substituting for Sam Neil's Alan Grant, who was left out of Crichton's book. Malcolm's girlfriend, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) and her team of biologists are sent to Isla Sorna to study the unique animals on the island. Meanwhile, InGen's team, led by great white hunter Roland Tembo, played with scene-stealing gusto by the late, great Pete Postlethwaite, come to capture some of the island's larger inhabitants. Ian Malcolm learns of this news and takes it upon himself to retrieve his girlfriend from the dinosaur-infested island. The Lost World doesn't bother much with exposition (After the pieces are put in place, it's non-stop dino-action), but David Koepp's script is not simple-minded. Here is a story that, in its own way, still develops its characters and encourages engagement. There are ideas present in The Lost World (on greed, nature, human hubris), which is more than you can say about its successors.One of the criticisms The Lost World often receives is that it lacks the compelling characters of the first film. It's a complaint that holds no water. Moore's wide-eyed, overly enthusiastic Dr. Harding, Vince Vaughn's militant eco-activist, Nick Van Owen, the aforementioned big game hunter, Tembo, and the rest of the new characters are, in the most basic sense, well drawn. What they lack in situational awareness (haters will have you know that there are dumb decisions made by some), they make up for in personality. Love them or hate them, these are real characters. People, with passions and flaws. Not the fleshy placeholders of JP3 and Jurassic World. And that's not to mention Jeff Goldblum, who carries the protagonist load admirably. When you think about it, his role here is not only different from the first film, but different from most anything Goldblum has done. We know he can do quirky, but his understated cynicism here comes off totally natural all the way through. Malcolm is the ultimate grounding force among all the dinosaur chaos; a huge asset to the movie.The cogent story and memorable characters, as welcome as they are, are only the icing on this cake. The essence of The Lost World is its fantastic dinosaur action. Here is where this movie outclasses nearly all its competitors. The Lost World is Steven Spielberg flexing his cinematic muscles. He takes the set pieces, a trailer dangling off a cliff, a basecamp ambush by territorial T-Rexes, or a raptor hunt in long grass, and weaves from them some real tension, suspense, and above all, thrills. Spielberg knows how to tease an action scene and have it explode to life at just the right time. Even when things move to San Diego in the final act, the richness of Spielberg's action remains. His sense for visual iconography, like glass slowly cracking, shadows streaking across tents, and trails being made in grass, is unparalleled. We've grown used to modern action that numbs the senses, but the satisfaction of Spielberg's action is that it enriches them. At this point, he's just showing off.But what is dinosaur action without the dinos themselves? If Jurassic Park redefined creature effects for the modern age, The Lost World perfected them. Combining the very best of both animatronics and digital effects, Stan Winston and ILM create dinosaurs even more dazzling than those in Jurassic Park. The intricately detailed large scale animatronics move smoothly with a wide range of motion, and the CGI is as photo real as anything in 1997, or today for that matter, but what separates these dinosaurs from other movie monsters is the way they are treated as characters. The dinosaurs of the Lost World: Jurassic Park are written and directed with a constant eye for realism. The T-Rex parents, the biggest stars of the film, don't chase and eat people just because they are T-Rexes. When they attack, we know why. They exhibit maternal instincts when their baby is taken from them and territorial instincts when the scientists venture too far into their domain (As do the stegosauruses, in a fabulous early scene). It is a credit to writer David Koepp that a film that could have easily devolved into mindless action maintains a certain level of intelligence, even in its most fantastic moments. And we aren't just told that the dinosaurs are ""animals, not monsters"". They actually behave that way. The T-Rexes sniff the air for signs of their baby, the raptors snap at each other during a hunt, the compys swarm a piece of food dropped on the beach; These moments feel like they were taken from a documentary. Of course this is how dinosaurs would behave. They are given reasons to roar and chase, when the lazy thing to do would be to create dinosaurs that exist only to look cool.Okay, so the story may not be as fresh as the original Jurassic Park, I can buy that, but The Lost World matches the first movie in nearly every other way. The special effects, action, score, set design, cinematography, you name it, they all carry the same mark of quality as the original Jurassic Park. There is passion behind the creation of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. A novel from Michael Crichton, Steven Spielberg at the helm, ILM and Stan Winston at the top of their respective games, and John Williams providing the music; This is the only Jurassic Park sequel that can stand with the original. It does exactly what a big budget sequel should do. It skips through the requisite set-up and launches full force into the thrills. The Lost World is jam-packed with jaw-dropping special effects and pulse-pounding action, yet it stays smart enough and scary enough to feel fulfilling. It's the very best kind of summer popcorn entertainment, and without question the best sequel to Jurassic Park.89/100",supremely thrilling suspenseful visually breathtaking lost world is summer

8.0,Underrated,"My Rating: *** out of ****. I dont understand all the horrible reviews for this film. Sure not a great film, but definitely a good, entertaining movie. I enjoyed it just as much as the first Jurassic Park. The Lost World still contains impressive, eye popping effects. These are just as flawless as the CGI as the first Jurassic Parks. There are more dinosaurs and they all look great. The film contains more action than the first and its all exciting. One scene that stands out is the scene with the Raptors in the fields. I love the way Spielberg shot it. This is not a big acting movie, but its not that bad. Jeff Goldblum is good as Ian Malcolm, but had a little more energy in the first one. Julianne Moore is adequate but looks a bit uncomfortable at times. Vanessa Lee Chester is better than the other kids in the last film. The rest of the acting is adequate. Many people thought this film was redundant of the first. I wouldnt call it redundant but it is a little bit too familiar in areas. The Lost World takes place in a different area but it is not much different from the first one. However, it is an entertaining movie. The action overshadows the story. The big problem I have with The Lost World is the ending. It doesnt make sense how The T-Rex got loose. Its also a King Kong Rip-Off. Its visually stunning looking, the TREX doesnt look out of place at all. But it was showing CGI instead of doing something with the story. Nevertheless, even with its flaws The Lost World is entertaining and not worthy of its horrible reviews.",underrated,my rating out i dont understand all horrible reviews this film sure not great film but definitely good entertaining movie i enjoyed it just as much as first jurassic park lost world still contains impressive eye popping effects these are just as flawless as cgi as first jurassic parks there are more dinosaurs they all look great film contains more action than first its all exciting one scene that stands out is scene with raptors fields i love way spielberg shot it this is not big acting movie but its not that bad jeff goldblum is good as ian malcolm but had little more energy first one julianne moore is adequate but looks bit uncomfortable at times vanessa lee chester is better than other kids last film rest acting is adequate many people thought this film was redundant first i wouldnt call it redundant but it is little bit too familiar areas lost world takes place different area but it is not much different first one however it is entertaining movie action overshadows story big problem i have with lost world is ending it doesnt make sense how t rex got loose its also king kong rip off its visually stunning looking trex doesnt look out place at all but it was showing cgi instead doing something with story nevertheless even with its flaws lost world is entertaining not worthy its horrible reviews,0.5173566595441595,0.1770432692307692,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Jurassic Park returns,"After the success of Jurassic Park it was only a matter of time before we would get a sequel. From what I understand Michael Crichton had no plans for a sequel but Steven Spielberg convince him to write a sequel.What we got was The Lost World. I remember in 1997 how fired up I was to learn we were going to get a sequel to Jurassic Park and I saw it twice in theaters with my family ended up getting a good percent of the toys from the film.Looking back on it I'm surprised the film wasn't given the R Rating considering how this is the most graphic film in the Trilogy and some of the scenes were too much for a PG-13 film. Despite the mix reviews I find it to be a good film sure it's not perfect it does have thrills and action like in the first film and some that are just wow and the only way to give it justice is to watch the film.The film plot this time centers around Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is asked by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to lead a research team onto Isla Sorna Site B the team being his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) and Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) and Ian's daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) who got to study how the Dinosaurs are surviving on the island all the while try and stop Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) as he leads a team of hunters lead by Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite),Dieter Stark (Peter Stormare),Ajay Sidhu (Ajay Sidhu), Dr. Robert Burke (Thomas F. Duffy) Carter (Thomas Rosales Jr)Cameo Joseph Mazzello returns as Tim and Ariana Richards returns as Lex for the start of the film. Being that this film takes place four years after Jurassic Park this film had a lot to live up to. The reaction in the theaters back in 1997 was huge so it did something right to get movie fans to be in awe by the film. The film feature some of the most tense scenes ever in a movie with my personal favorite scene is when Ian, Nick and Sarah are hanging over the cliff in their trailers that scene will have your skin crawling and your nerves up high. And the effects for the dinosaurs are once again impressive as they used a mix of Puppet work and C.G.I. In this film you can feel that the Dinosaurs are meant for business each time they are screen you know something is about to happen. That what give the movie a edge when it comes to seeing how the characters react to the Dinosaurs in the film The music once again is amazing, John Williams music always tells a story and this film is no different each score he wrote for this film matches the story and plot each time you hear his music you can tell some love went into these score.The film also features good quotes like ""Predators don't hunt when they're not hungry"" and ""Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long sad history of bad ideas"".The film is pretty dark as this often times feels like a horror film as the scenes can feel that way when you see the predators coming out of hiding you'll be able to understand where I'm coming fromFor the Dinosaurs we get Two Tyrannosaurus Rex one male one female as well as a young one, Compsognathus, Gallimimus,Mamenchisaurus Pachycephalosaurus,Edmontosaurus,Parasaurolophus,Pteranodon Stegosaurus,Triceratops and Velociraptor. Each Dinosaur is amazing to watch on the screen which is why I love the Jurassic Park films.You can tell the film makers love to make these movies While this film did get some mix reviews I found it to be a worthy sequel to Jurassic Park is it perfect? No but it does well with the plot the tense action scenes and stunts the acting is pretty good and the music is amazing to listen to. My advice is to watch the movie for yourself you'll be impress if you just sit back and enjoyI give The Lost World: Jurassic Park an 8 out of 10",jurassic park returns,after success jurassic park it was only matter time before we would get sequel what i understand michael crichton had no plans sequel but steven spielberg convince him write sequel what we got was lost world i remember 1997 how fired up i was learn we were going get sequel jurassic park i saw it twice theaters with my family ended up getting good percent toys film looking back it im surprised film wasnt given r rating considering how this is most graphic film trilogy some scenes were too much pg 13 film despite mix reviews i find it be good film sure its not perfect it does have thrills action like first film some that are just wow only way give it justice is watch film film plot this time centers around ian malcolm jeff goldblum who is asked by john hammond richard attenborough lead research team onto isla sorna site b team being his girlfriend sarah harding julianne moore nick van owen vince vaughn eddie carr richard schiff ians daughter kelly vanessa lee chester who got study how dinosaurs are surviving island all while try stop peter ludlow arliss howard as he leads team hunters lead by roland tembo pete postlethwaite dieter stark peter stormare ajay sidhu ajay sidhu dr robert burke thomas f duffy carter thomas rosales jr cameo joseph mazzello returns as tim ariana richards returns as lex start film being that this film takes place four years after jurassic park this film had lot live up reaction theaters back 1997 was huge so it did something right get movie fans be awe by film film feature some most tense scenes ever movie with my personal favorite scene is when ian nick sarah are hanging over cliff their trailers that scene will have your skin crawling your nerves up high effects dinosaurs are once again impressive as they used mix puppet work c g i this film you can feel that dinosaurs are meant business each time they are screen you know something is about happen that what give movie edge when it comes seeing how characters react dinosaurs film music once again is amazing john williams music always tells story this film is no different each score he wrote this film matches story plot each time you hear his music you can tell some love went into these score film also features good quotes like predators dont hunt when theyre not hungry taking dinosaurs off this island is worst idea long sad history bad ideas film is pretty dark as this often times feels like horror film as scenes can feel that way when you see predators coming out hiding youll be able understand where im coming fromfor dinosaurs we get two tyrannosaurus rex one male one female as well as young one compsognathus gallimimus mamenchisaurus pachycephalosaurus edmontosaurus parasaurolophus pteranodon stegosaurus triceratops velociraptor each dinosaur is amazing watch screen which is why i love jurassic park films you can tell film makers love make these movies while this film did get some mix reviews i found it be worthy sequel jurassic park is it perfect no but it does well with plot tense action scenes stunts acting is pretty good music is amazing listen my advice is watch movie yourself youll be impress if you just sit back enjoyi give lost world jurassic park 8 out 10,0.587620573870574,0.1903604728604728,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
4.0,Jurassic Park II: The Lost Plot,"The first Jurassic Park film worked because it focused on the morality of the entire situation, with the dinosaurs playing a supporting role (though quite a large one, considering the incredible visual effects). Unfortunately, the sequel does not hold true to this formula, and instead has idiotic characters doing inane tasks, all the while showcasing the roaring dinos and, in the end, turning into little more than Godzilla.For a basic plot summary, ""The Lost World"" reveals the existence of another island, not disclosed in the original, where the dinosaurs were originally ""bred"" and now live in their own contained environment. Of course, bloodthirsty, money-hungry poaches are out to destroy the ecological paradise, so Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the only significant character to reprise his role from the original, and girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) are sent in to investigate. As expected, things go awry and a certain key species of the dinosauric terrors ends up a bit close to home for comfort.The trouble with this film is that it has absolutely no semblance of a plot. None whatsoever. Whereas the original really inspired viewers to think about the morality at stake in Dr. Hammond's experiments, this sequel only focuses on the ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" at the incredibly life-life dinosaurs to be had by potential viewers. In fact, by the end of the film, the script has devolved into nothing better than King Kong or Godzilla fare.That being said, I will give this film two stars instead of one because, gosh darn it, those dinos ARE pretty impressive! Though a bit of the ""wow"" factor has worn off since the first installment, when the T-Rex roars or the Velociraptors begin preying, the hair on the back of your neck will stand up once again. I honestly don't know if the effects could be any better, even in today's Hollywood.Overall, though, this is a terribly constructed sequel that focuses on all the wrong things. It opened to tremendous hype and made a lot of money initially, but the passage of time has shown it to be quite subpar. I'm amazed that a film directed by a legend such as Steven Spielberg could turn out so vapid.",jurassic park ii lost plot,first jurassic park film worked because it focused morality entire situation with dinosaurs playing supporting role though quite large one considering incredible visual effects unfortunately sequel does not hold true this formula instead has idiotic characters doing inane tasks all while showcasing roaring dinos end turning into little more than godzilla basic plot summary lost world reveals existence another island not disclosed original where dinosaurs were originally bred now live their own contained environment course bloodthirsty money hungry poaches are out destroy ecological paradise so dr ian malcolm jeff goldblum only significant character reprise his role original girlfriend dr sarah harding julianne moore are sent investigate as expected things go awry certain key species dinosauric terrors ends up bit close home comfort trouble with this film is that it has absolutely no semblance plot none whatsoever whereas original really inspired viewers think about morality at stake dr hammonds experiments this sequel only focuses oohs aahs at incredibly life life dinosaurs be had by potential viewers fact by end film script has devolved into nothing better than king kong or godzilla fare that being said i will give this film two stars instead one because gosh darn it those dinos are pretty impressive though bit wow factor has worn off since first installment when t rex roars or velociraptors begin preying hair back your neck will stand up once again i honestly dont know if effects could be any better even todays hollywood overall though this is terribly constructed sequel that focuses all wrong things it opened tremendous hype made lot money initially but passage time has shown it be quite subpar im amazed that film directed by legend such as steven spielberg could turn out so vapid,0.6196808510638296,0.12912982407663257,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,"The Lost World boasts simply incredible visuals, a lovable cast, a novel idea and a lingering sense of ominous dread. I could never have asked for more in a sequel.","Where do you go when you've created one of the best popcorn thriller films of all time? Many of the haters of The Lost World wouldn't be able to answer that question. Meanwhile, I believe that Spielberg and Koepp found the right way to go about it, and created an delightfully ominous sequel with enough substance that it can proudly stand beside the original.The Lost World is noticeably different to the first, which Spielberg, Crichton and Koepp deserve credit for. They haven't just remade the first one all over again. They've brought back the stuff we loved - water vibrations, the wonderful score, Jeff Goldblum - and added plenty of new stuff so that this film can stand on its own.I love the feel of The Lost World. There is some terrific tension, some outstanding drama and I never once felt that I was watching a set - its a real place. Two of the greatest scenes in the film are Sarah on the glass, and the slow ruts carved in the grass as the raptors close in. Its so tense and yet beautiful in its simplicity. My absolute favourite scene are Eddie's attempts to rescue Nick, Sarah and Ian from the trailer. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong. And when the T-Rexes show up to attack Eddie, I groaned in sympathy, for what else could possibly go wrong? Even the jump scares in this movie were effective.What always set Jurassic Park aside from its popcorn thriller counterparts is its wonderful cast. The original had a beloved trio of characters and even beloved minor characters like Robert Muldoon. This film takes that formula and even manages to improve on it. Kelly isn't as good as Lex and Tim, but the writers made a wise choice in focusing on Ian Malcolm as the film's protagonist, wheras the previous film sidelined him for most of the movie. Of the new additions, I loved Julianne Moore as Sarah, Vince Vaughn was surprisingly believable as Nick, the ever-underrated Richard Schiff is terrific as sardonic Eddie Carr, and Arliss Howard strikes the perfect note as the villainous Peter Ludlow. He isn't diabolical, but rather snobbishly set in his ways, and he fits the film perfectly. But by far the best character in the film was Pete Postlethwaite's Roland Tembo. His opening monologue sold me on him before he even got halfway through it. He's fast-talking, knows what he wants and doesn't suffer fools. I would have loved to see more of him. The VISUALS of this movie! I never fully appreciated the animatronics of Jurassic Park until I saw this film as well. The highest compliment I can possibly offer is that the dinosaurs look real. I could touch them and I can tell what they'd feel like. A small dinosaur headbutting a car door, and a T-Rex chomping on a traffic light are the two highlights of just how seamlessly the visuals blend with the reality. These days, the dinosaurs would be 100% computer animated, and that is a dreadful shame, because present day films can't capture even a fraction of the wonder of this film.Yes there are a few flaws. The opening scene raised the stakes so high, until John Hammond reveals that the young girl survived. Not only is this completely unbelievable (when looking at Dieter's fate later in the film) but it makes the opening scene obsolete. They should've just told the story without showing us, because the appeal of Jurassic Park is its ominous tone.At times, the camera cuts away from crucial moments, but considering that they were limited to what they could create at the time I can forgive it. Dieter's death is the most obvious example - he runs behind a log and gives up the fight instantly so he can die off camera. Yes the gymnastics scene was a bit silly, but I didn't mind in the scheme of things. The T-Rex stomping through San Diego felt both tacked on and required a huge suspension of disbelief (no one hears it stomping around) and there are a few major plot holes (namely, if the T-Rex devoured the crew of the ship, why was it still trapped?

7.0,A decent sequel!!,"Jurassic Park: The lost world is a science fiction action adventure movie directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Late Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, Vince Vaughn and Vanessa Lee Chester.This movie is second movie in Jurassic Park Franchise.After watching the first movie I was quite excited and hopeful towards this movie but was quite disappointed after reading the reviews but after watching this movie I must say that instead of going after reviews you should watch the movie first and judge because for me the movie is made decently.The plot of the movie is different from the previous one and has a decent execution. The best part of the movie is that you don't have to wait for long to see the dinosaurs as they are introduced quite early in comparison to it's first part.Acting is great and all the characters had done a decent job. Screenplay of the movie is good but it starts getting bore and slow in between but tightens the grip as the movie approaches to it's climax.VFX and cinematography is good and climax is also good although could've been little shorter and crispier.

10.0,Another Steven Spielberg Classic Comes To Life,"It has been four years since Jurassic Park was destroyed and the island Isla Nublar itself was drowned by a hurricane killing most of the dinosaurs; now there is a new island (called Isla Sorna) that has been genetically engineering the same animals, but abandoned the project after the company InGen declared bankruptcy.The film's short prologue introduces a rich family who are trying to enjoy their vacation on the beach of Isla Sorna, but their little girl wanders off into the jungles of the beach where she encounters a small dinosaur called a Compy in which she assumes it's a friendly creature, but turns out to have little friends of its own when they start pecking body parts of her off screen.Jurassic Park survivor Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) returns to John Hammond (Richard Attenbrouogh) after being called upon. This time Hammond wants Malcolm to send in a team of specialists to go in and document the island where he wants to show the world that the dinosaurs are safe and not dangerous animals. Malcolm finds out that his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already on the island and doesn't realize what she's getting into.With the team on the island, they track down Sarah and realize that Malcolm has another surprise that his daughter Kelly has sneaked in one of the trailers and disobeyed her father's orders of staying on the mainland.Another team is on the island not to document but to capture and retrieve the animals to make a zoo. The team is lead by Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard in a bad English accent) who wants to make a profit after the company InGen suffers a lost in profit and damage from the original Jurassic Park. He gets a big game hunter name Roland Tembo (Pete Postelwaite) who wants to bag a Tyrannosaurus Rex as his trophy.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is great entertainment; the special effects are twice worthy than the original.

It is the film that basically regenerated the action adventure genre. There is not a creature feature out there that does not owe something to JURASSIC PARK. But, here with this film, we wonder if was really someone's original idea that they came up with because they had the idea stuck in the back of their head somewhere, or if they just did it because they were hoping of a repeat of the first film.

8.0,A Worthy Sequel to One of My Favorite Movies,"Steven Spielberg returns with a sequel to his 1993 blockbuster that I believe was under-rated by many people. I loved the film when I first saw it in theaters in 1997 and, while it didn't seem as impressive on second viewing, I still find it to be one of the best sequels I've seen. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough returns for this short cameo) has discovered that some of the dinosaurs originally intended for his park have been surviving on the secondary island, Isla Sorna. Isla Sorna housed the location of Site B, where most of the dinosaurs would be hatched before bringing them over to Isla Nublar and Jurassic Park. Hammond is determined to send a team, led by a more than reluctant Ian Malcolm, to the island to retrieve photographic documentation of the thriving dinosaurs in an effort to gain public support in preserving the location.Just as the first film, this one retains some primary similarities to Michael Crichton's novel but it also takes a lot of liberties. Unlike 'Jurassic Park', I read the book before seeing the film for 'The Lost World' and so I was more aware of what the film COULD have been. Of course, those doesn't mean I didn't love the movie. There were just a lot of great scenes that were cut from the original story to fit into Spielberg's view.Of the cast from the original, the only returning key player is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm was my favorite character from the first film so it was awesome having him return as the lead. I loved the additions of Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Peter Stormare to the cast (though Stormare's role was small). Goldblum's one of my favorite actors and teaming him with Vince Vaughn was great. In addition to another great cast, this film gives us more dinosaurs than the previous. The audience gets their first glimpses of stegosaurs and compsognathus. We also get not one but two tyrannosaurs in this film AND they get more screen time this time around.Personally, I don't understand why some people complain about this movie. It's just as fun as the first; I don't quite understand what people feel is missing. I doesn't contain the some sense of wonder as the first film because this time we're already seen the dinosaurs in action. I've heard some complaints about the climactic sequence in San Diego. Aside from the fact that it deviated so much from the book with this sequence, I thought it was awesome. It gave the audience a chance to look at the dinosaurs in a new light, a new environment. I stand by my 8/10 rating because I found this movie to be a worthwhile sequel to one of my favorite movies.",worthy sequel one my favorite movies,steven spielberg returns with sequel his 1993 blockbuster that i believe was under rated by many people i loved film when i first saw it theaters 1997 while it didnt seem as impressive second viewing i still find it be one best sequels ive seen john hammond richard attenborough returns this short cameo has discovered that some dinosaurs originally intended his park have been surviving secondary island isla sorna isla sorna housed location site b where most dinosaurs would be hatched before bringing them over isla nublar jurassic park hammond is determined send team led by more than reluctant ian malcolm island retrieve photographic documentation thriving dinosaurs effort gain public support preserving location just as first film this one retains some primary similarities michael crichtons novel but it also takes lot liberties unlike jurassic park i read book before seeing film lost world so i was more aware what film could have been course those doesnt mean i didnt love movie there were just lot great scenes that were cut original story fit into spielbergs view cast original only returning key player is jeff goldblum as ian malcolm malcolm was my favorite character first film so it was awesome having him return as lead i loved additions vince vaughn pete postlethwaite peter stormare cast though stormares role was small goldblums one my favorite actors teaming him with vince vaughn was great addition another great cast this film gives us more dinosaurs than previous audience gets their first glimpses stegosaurs compsognathus we also get not one but two tyrannosaurs this film they get more screen time this time around personally i dont understand why some people complain about this movie its just as fun as first i dont quite understand what people feel is missing i doesnt contain some sense wonder as first film because this time were already seen dinosaurs action ive heard some complaints about climactic sequence san diego aside fact that it deviated so much book with this sequence i thought it was awesome it gave audience chance look at dinosaurs new light new environment i stand by my 8 10 rating because i found this movie be worthwhile sequel one my favorite movies,0.5496063576945929,0.35003713606654785,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"

4.0,Rough going,"There's another island. Isla Sorna is where the dinosaurs were raised and also where a rich little girl wanders into a compsognathus attack. From this opening, you know that you're in for a much darker ride. It's one of those movies where kindly Spielberg decides that he should have made Night Skies instead of E.T. and indulges all the meanness he has festering inside upon his characters.John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow is trying to use the island to fix the losses that Jurassic Park incurred. The old man has taken a dramatic change of heart, realizing that he should have never tried to open a theme park all those years ago and that these dinosaurs need to be protected. If you're kind of taken aback by all of the character flip-flops here, buckle up. You know - because guys in their seventies suddenly stop being capitalists and suddenly start caring for the common man, like Peter on the road to Damascus. It can happen.Ian Malcolm is the only one that comes back, save for cameos from his grandchildren. Turns out that Julianne Moore is in this, playing Ian's girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding, and that she's already on the island. For the last four years, Ian has been discredited and disbarred for speaking out on Jurassic Park. The last thing he wants to do is go back, but to save the girl he loves, he has to.Ian joins the team of equipment guy Eddie Carr and documentarian Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn), as well as his daughter Kelly who has stowed away. Just as they catch up with Dr. Sarah, a whole new InGen squad shows up, made up of mercs and hunters. Chief amongst them are Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo, a big game hunter who dreams of bagging a T. Rex, Fargo's Peter Stormare as Dieter Stark and Dr. Robert Burke, a dinosaur expert played by Thomas F. Duffy (the demeted Charles Wilson from Death Wish 2!).Tembo's plan is to tie up a baby T. Rex and use it to lure in the mother or father. And InGen wants to get as many dinosaurs as possible so they can open a new Jurassic Park in San Diego. None of these ideas are good and they blow up in everyone's face.There's a great moment in here where all of Malcolm's team's vehicles plunge off a cliff and some nifty action pieces, but it all feels rather disjointed. By the time everyone teams up and gets off the island, I was kind of hoping the film was over, only to learn there was so much more movie left. It's a very late 90's style of blockbuster - give it more running time and more story versus more thinking.At the end, the dinosaurs are placed in an animal preserve free from human interference. Hammond steals Malcolm's line, saying that ""Life will find a way.""Spielberg eventually said that he didn't enjoy making this film. It kind of shows. He stated, ""I beat myself up... growing more and more impatient with myself... It made me wistful about doing a talking picture because sometimes I got the feeling I was just making this big silent-roar movie... I found myself saying, 'Is that all there is? It's not enough for me.'""",rough going,theres another island isla sorna is where dinosaurs were raised also where rich little girl wanders into compsognathus attack this opening you know that youre much darker ride its one those movies where kindly spielberg decides that he should have made night skies instead e t indulges all meanness he has festering inside upon his characters john hammonds nephew peter ludlow is trying use island fix losses that jurassic park incurred old man has taken dramatic change heart realizing that he should have never tried open theme park all those years ago that these dinosaurs need be protected if youre kind taken aback by all character flip flops here buckle up you know because guys their seventies suddenly stop being capitalists suddenly start caring common man like peter road damascus it can happen ian malcolm is only one that comes back save cameos his grandchildren turns out that julianne moore is this playing ians girlfriend dr sarah harding that shes already island last four years ian has been discredited disbarred speaking out jurassic park last thing he wants do is go back but save girl he loves he has ian joins team equipment guy eddie carr documentarian nick van owen vince vaughn as well as his daughter kelly who has stowed away just as they catch up with dr sarah whole new ingen squad shows up made up mercs hunters chief amongst them are pete postlethwaite as roland tembo big game hunter who dreams bagging t rex fargos peter stormare as dieter stark dr robert burke dinosaur expert played by thomas f duffy demeted charles wilson death wish 2 tembos plan is tie up baby t rex use it lure mother or father ingen wants get as many dinosaurs as possible so they can open new jurassic park san diego none these ideas are good they blow up everyones face theres great moment here where all malcolms teams vehicles plunge off cliff some nifty action pieces but it all feels rather disjointed by time everyone teams up gets off island i was kind hoping film was over only learn there was so much more movie left its very late 90s style blockbuster give it more running time more story versus more thinking at end dinosaurs are placed animal preserve free human interference hammond steals malcolms line saying that life will find way spielberg eventually said that he didnt enjoy making this film it kind shows he stated i beat myself up growing more more impatient with myself it made me wistful about doing talking picture because sometimes i got feeling i was just making this big silent roar movie i found myself saying is that all there is its not enough me,0.4739270253555969,0.15585497835497836,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,I like it,"I saw this in a theater in 1997 and I thought I liked it. I just saw it again on DVD last night, and I now I know I do. What I can't figure out is why so many people think it's so horrible.  After seeing JP III a few weeks ago, I still think The Lost World is better. Of course the original is the best, but The Lost World is packed with suspense, witty dialogue (especially Goldblum's), and of course, the usual great looking dinosaurs. There are a few things I don't like, the gymnastics routine towards the end being at the top of the list. But other than that and a few silly lines, this movie is almost as thrilling as the first. Personally, I don't care if the plot of this one is weak. I've never even really given that any thought. The first 100 minutes or so are loaded with excitement, then the finale with the T-Rex in the city is, if you ask me, played mostly for laughs. Yes it's like Godzilla, and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, but that's the point. It's like those movies but with 21st century (almost) special effects. And it's just plain fun to see this dinosaur stomping through the suburbs, drinking from a swimming pool and, wreaking havoc at gas station minimart. I think if you don't take the San Diego scenes too seriously, and look at it as Spielberg's way of paying homage to *and* poking fun at the Godzilla-type movies, you can appreciate this portion of the movie. Then to wrap it all up with Bernard Shaw from CNN, and an obvious open door to a sequel - what more could you ask for? Well, maybe a better plot as some people seem to be saying, but I think this is a great popcorn movie and it works for me.",i like it,i saw this theater 1997 i thought i liked it i just saw it again dvd last night i now i know i do what i cant figure out is why so many people think its so horrible after seeing jp iii few weeks ago i still think lost world is better course original is best but lost world is packed with suspense witty dialogue especially goldblums course usual great looking dinosaurs there are few things i dont like gymnastics routine towards end being at top list but other than that few silly lines this movie is almost as thrilling as first personally i dont care if plot this one is weak ive never even really given that any thought first 100 minutes or so are loaded with excitement then finale with t rex city is if you ask me played mostly laughs yes its like godzilla beast 20 000 fathoms but thats point its like those movies but with 21st century almost special effects its just plain fun see this dinosaur stomping through suburbs drinking swimming pool wreaking havoc at gas station minimart i think if you dont take san diego scenes too seriously look at it as spielbergs way paying homage poking fun at godzilla type movies you can appreciate this portion movie then wrap it all up with bernard shaw cnn obvious open door sequel what more could you ask well maybe better plot as some people seem be saying but i think this is great popcorn movie it works me,0.4858163265306122,0.15955782312925168,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.32}"
