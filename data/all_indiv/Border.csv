9.0,Indian Cinema no. 1,"Border (1997) is an bloody war film filled with an hour's worth of singing. The story is about a company of soldiers (most of the Punjabs) who must defend the India/Pakistan border at all costs. Tensions between the two countries were at the boiling point. The Pakistanis were preparing an all out assault on the Indian border. Based upon a real incident, the actors were great in their roles and the film makers made these characters flesh and blood instead of mere cardboard figures. Each has a tale to tell (in song with a lot of musical numbers). Who will win this incredibly high tensioned battle of survival?A great film. I enjoyed it very much. I have watched several Indian films before and if I can find more like these then I can find a new film industry to keep an eye upon. The D.V.D. I saw was in stereo with English sub-titles. Over three hours long and highly entertaining. The violence content is high and a must for action fans and history buffs.",indian cinema no 1,border 1997 is bloody war film filled with hours worth singing story is about company soldiers most punjabs who must defend india pakistan border at all costs tensions between two countries were at boiling point pakistanis were preparing all out assault indian border based upon real incident actors were great their roles film makers made these characters flesh blood instead mere cardboard figures each has tale tell song with lot musical numbers who will win this incredibly high tensioned battle survival great film i enjoyed it very much i have watched several indian films before if i can find more like these then i can find new film industry keep eye upon d v d i saw was stereo with english sub titles over three hours long highly entertaining violence content is high must action fans history buffs,0.44259740259740254,0.226969696969697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.52}"
10.0,Best Indian War Movie Ever!,"Border is the best war movie with mind-blowing action. Everyone gave powerful performances, lead by my favorite star, Sunny Deol. He was perfect as the brave Sardarji armyman, and this is definitely his greatest performance of the 90's (even more intense than Ghayal, Ghatak, Ziddi). He is the true action hero above others. He is so inspirational and very commanding to the point that you truly feel the patriotism and determination and love for your nation. This is definitely, one of the most powerful and realistic (based on 1971 Indo-Pak war) action movies that I have ever seen. It is as others say, ""Men at their best! War at its worst!"" This is a must watch for all Indians who really do love their country. It is shocking that despite the fact that this was the biggest blockbuster in '97, it was practically ignored by the corrupt and biased media. Border should have swept nearly all awards (it was worthy of Oscars). Watch this movie! 12/10.",best indian war movie ever,border is best war movie with mind blowing action everyone gave powerful performances lead by my favorite star sunny deol he was perfect as brave sardarji armyman this is definitely his greatest performance 90s even more intense than ghayal ghatak ziddi he is true action hero above others he is so inspirational very commanding point that you truly feel patriotism determination love your nation this is definitely one most powerful realistic based 1971 indo pak war action movies that i have ever seen it is as others say men at their best war at its worst this is must watch all indians who really do love their country it is shocking that despite fact that this was biggest blockbuster 97 it was practically ignored by corrupt biased media border should have swept nearly all awards it was worthy oscars watch this movie 12 10,0.6270114942528735,0.2948275862068966,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,The Indian Alamo,"A very good war movie, despite somewhat expected chauvinist moments counterpointed by fluffy pacifist messages. Nice exploration of the inner personal dramas of the characters, and how it will affect their battle actions.

10.0,"In the 1971 war, Pakistan Army opens Western Front by attacking Longewala Post which eventually turns out to be pathetic decision for them","The Movie is an attempt to bring into limelight the Historic Battle of Longewala located in Rajasthan. The Pakistan Army opens Western Front against India to force away Indian effort to liberate Bangladesh from tyrant Pakistani rule.The Pakistani Army assuming that Indian Forces have only limited presence on Western Border attacks through Rajasthan in Longewala. The movie depicts true event and is not a piece of fiction as far as Battle is concerned.Its true that there was a company of only 120 men against almost 2500 Pakistani Troops along with over 60 Tanks engaged in the Battle of Longewala. The Indian Post at Longewala had strategic advantage of being at higher level and also was one of the prime reasons for shameful defeat of Pakistani Tank Column and Infantry at the hands of a handful Indians !!The characters have been carefully chosen and developed beautifully in the movie. The Battle appears almost real with men at their respective positions as in actual battle. The intensity is high and so is the depiction of morale. The Indian Air Force striking the Pakistanis in the morning was clearly seen although there was a little more role that IAF played in actual battle. The dramatic scenes are good enough to make you shed a tear for the unsung heros.Overall the movie is great considering the complexities involved in shooting a real war scene. Its a must watch for all the people who do not know about the battle that is considered a strategic one in defeat the Pakistani Army by Indian Forces in 1971 war.The movie is complete with patriotic moments,is well shot and well delivered.

8.0,superb,Superb.I really have pity on some of reviewers who brand movie chauvinistic.How else a war movie is supposed to be? Especially when those whom you are fighting were your own countrymen till a few years back. A pretty good depiction of Indian Army and air force and relationship between different soldiers and their dilemma. Movie also touches on pathetic condition of Indian soldiers financially in those days which is no longer a case.Most haunting scene of Movie is Rakhi wandering in tank ridden field with Serra for his son.This single scene depicts the futility of war. But there should have been paid more attention to details of war e.g. even real life soldiers have said that they were not that outnumbered and main factor was air force not the army but it is true that they did hold a whole battalion with the help of anti tank mines.,superb,superb i really have pity some reviewers who brand movie chauvinistic how else war movie is supposed be especially when those whom you are fighting were your own countrymen till few years back pretty good depiction indian army air force relationship between different soldiers their dilemma movie also touches pathetic condition indian soldiers financially those days which is no longer case most haunting scene movie is rakhi wandering tank ridden field with serra his son this single scene depicts futility war but there should have been paid more attention details war e g even real life soldiers have said that they were not that outnumbered main factor was air force not army but it is true that they did hold whole battalion with help anti tank mines,0.5298809523809525,0.21476190476190476,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9.0,A deep story and survey of war,"J.P Dutta's brother fought and was martyred in war. He knows and has experienced what he is talking about, the pain that the soldiers' families feel when war is fought. The Indian army and soldiers' stereotypes abound in this movie. Indian soldiers are brave, moral, and fiercely patriotic. The two soldier, Dharam Veer (Akshay)and Mathura Das who doubts this in the beginning are later brought on to the patriotic side before the war is fought. Jackie Shroff, the airbase commander, anxiously waits so he can relieve his brethren. These shots, are very deep and not overdone. It is just symbolic of the deep relationships that are built in this movie. The antiwar message and Indo-Pak friendship message is spoiled a bit by the bravery, heroism of the Indian soldiers and villanizing of the Pakistanis. But I am so glad that he puts it in there. Mere Dushmaan Mere Bhai is a great way to end the movie. The acting in this movie, at least by the men, is superb. Pooja Bhatt excels and leaves an impression even though she is in only briefly. The songs of this movie add a lot to the movie.

3.0,"If this is a good example of Indian film-making, I'd hate to see a bad one","First off, I'm neither Indian nor Pakistani, so I didn't come come to this movie with any feelings about the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war one way or the other. In fact, although I'm fairly well acquainted with the war, I had never heard of this movie, or anyone in it, before I saw it listed on Netflix, and based on the description, I thought it might be interesting so I rented it. Bad move on my part.To begin with, for a film that obviously cost quite a bit of money, it's very sloppily made. It was a bit of a puzzlement when a character starts speaking in English and in the middle of the sentence switches to Hindi, or vice-versa. Don't know why the filmmakers did that, but it's very annoying (as were the completely bizarre musical numbers that were inserted into the middle of the film. Seeing squads of Indian soldiers singing and dancing in the middle of the desert on the eve of war was disconcerting, to say the least. Also, although the film's Hindi dialogue was subtitled in English, the lyrics to the songs weren't. Strange.). The acting for the most part was more reminiscent of an overblown 1909 D.W. Griffith melodrama than a modern (1997) war picture, full of grand theatrical gesturing and overheated, pretentious and ultimately boring stretches of dialogue. The ""action"" scenes were, to put it mildly, pathetic. I realize this was based on an actual incident, but it must have been VERY ""loosely"" based because the action consists of wildly improbable and hysterically phony heroics by the Indian soldiers that make the laughable Chuck Norris ""Missing in Action"" travesties look like documentaries, sneering villainy by the Pakistani side (I almost expected to see the head Pakistani officer twirling his mustache and tying a young girl to the railroad tracks while cackling ""Nyah ah ah!"") and dialogue that Ed Wood would be too embarrassed to write (one soldier, explaining his mother's blindness, says, ""She went blind from the tears she had shed"" for her deceased war-hero husband). The special effects are laughable--tanks that get ""blown up"" are obviously wooden mock-ups, as you can see flaming pieces of wood showering the ground after the explosions and what's left of the tank's ""hulk"" shattering when it hits the ground, and when some soldiers are ""shot"" you can see the square outline of the blocks the exploding squibs are attached to beneath their uniforms. One Indian soldier who finds himself in the no-man's-land between the Indian trenches and the attacking Pakistanis suddenly charges the enemy line and is promptly shot about 20 times for his trouble, but amazingly is rescued and brought back to the Indian positions, where he holds on for awhile before finally expiring (after, of course, giving a patriotic speech), while Pakistani soldiers who get shot only once die immediately. However, there's a scene where the Pakistanis overrun the Indian trenches and some very brutal hand-to-hand fighting occurs, and that is reasonably well done--much better than the rest of the ""action"" was.All in all, it's a clumsy and badly written (and edited, and acted, and scored) mixture of Hindu nationalism, Indian jingoism, stupidly phony heroics and wildly out-of-place musical numbers. If this is an example of the best that ""Bollywood"" has to offer, as some reviewers here seem to think, then thanks but no thanks.",if this is good example indian film making id hate see bad one,first off im neither indian nor pakistani so i didnt come come this movie with any feelings about 1971 indo pakistani war one way or other fact although im fairly well acquainted with war i had never heard this movie or anyone it before i saw it listed netflix based description i thought it might be interesting so i rented it bad move my part begin with film that obviously cost quite bit money its very sloppily made it was bit puzzlement when character starts speaking english middle sentence switches hindi or vice versa dont know why filmmakers did that but its very annoying as were completely bizarre musical numbers that were inserted into middle film seeing squads indian soldiers singing dancing middle desert eve war was disconcerting say least also although films hindi dialogue was subtitled english lyrics songs werent strange acting most part was more reminiscent overblown 1909 d w griffith melodrama than modern 1997 war picture full grand theatrical gesturing overheated pretentious ultimately boring stretches dialogue action scenes were put it mildly pathetic i realize this was based actual incident but it must have been very loosely based because action consists wildly improbable hysterically phony heroics by indian soldiers that make laughable chuck norris missing action travesties look like documentaries sneering villainy by pakistani side i almost expected see head pakistani officer twirling his mustache tying young girl railroad tracks while cackling nyah ah ah dialogue that ed wood would be too embarrassed write one soldier explaining his mothers blindness says she went blind tears she had shed her deceased war hero husband special effects are laughable tanks that get blown up are obviously wooden mock ups as you can see flaming pieces wood showering ground after explosions whats left tanks hulk shattering when it hits ground when some soldiers are shot you can see square outline blocks exploding squibs are attached beneath their uniforms one indian soldier who finds himself no mans land between indian trenches attacking pakistanis suddenly charges enemy line is promptly shot about 20 times his trouble but amazingly is rescued brought back indian positions where he holds awhile before finally expiring after course giving patriotic speech while pakistani soldiers who get shot only once die immediately however theres scene where pakistanis overrun indian trenches some very brutal hand hand fighting occurs that is reasonably well done much better than rest action was all all its clumsy badly written edited acted scored mixture hindu nationalism indian jingoism stupidly phony heroics wildly out place musical numbers if this is example best that bollywood has offer as some reviewers here seem think then thanks but no thanks,0.4570362473347548,-0.06208244491826579,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.35}"
