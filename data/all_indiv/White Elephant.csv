1,Non-Stop Stupid and Awful,"Don't bother watching this because if you've seen the last ten movies in which Bruce Willis makes a cameo, this one is just more of the same. Gratuitous violence, tiresome, faux tough-guy dialogue, and mind-numbingly stupid gun-play don't make for much when it comes to entertainment, as if just throwing these elements into a pot will somehow produce anything fit for adult consumption.Does this film have a story? It's hard to say when they hurl an endless torrent of blood and bullets at the audience in an attempt to distract you from the fact that if there is a story, it's too unoriginal to even mention. I've never played a video game, but I would imagine that Grand Theft Auto has more of a plot than White Elephant.You can't even blame the actors in the movie. It's like pulling a bunch of garbage from the dumpster and expecting someone to cook a meal with it.A few things writers of action movies should already understand:Drywall will not stop a round from an assault rifle, neither will a car door. Some high-powered rounds can go through an entire house and still kill you.If you want to kill someone on the sly, don't use a gun as it's too messy, especially if you are then going to take the body somewhere else to disposed of it. Just take the live guy to the disposal area, then get rid of him. If the cops stop you on the way there, it's a lot easier to explain a guy in the back seat than a corpse in the trunk.Try reading books so that everything you write isn't exactly like the last twenty movies you streamed. I doubt Hollywood writers can be bothered to read books, this seems obvious from their output of puerile doggerel like this film.If you can't choreograph a decent gun battle, stop thinking that five more in the film will improve things.",non stop stupid awful,dont bother watching this because if youve seen last ten movies which bruce willis makes cameo this one is just more same gratuitous violence tiresome faux tough guy dialogue mind numbingly stupid gun play dont make much when it comes entertainment as if just throwing these elements into pot will somehow produce anything fit adult consumption does this film have story its hard say when they hurl endless torrent blood bullets at audience attempt distract you fact that if there is story its too unoriginal even mention ive never played video game but i would imagine that grand theft auto has more plot than white elephant you cant even blame actors movie its like pulling bunch garbage dumpster expecting someone cook meal with it few things writers action movies should already understand drywall will not stop round assault rifle neither will car door some high powered rounds can go through entire house still kill you if you want kill someone sly dont use gun as its too messy especially if you are then going take body somewhere else disposed it just take live guy disposal area then get rid him if cops stop you way there its lot easier explain guy back seat than corpse trunk try reading books so that everything you write isnt exactly like last twenty movies you streamed i doubt hollywood writers can be bothered read books this seems obvious their output puerile doggerel like this film if you cant choreograph decent gun battle stop thinking that five more film will improve things,0.4764215686274509,-0.06154486036838978,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6,"Solid B-movie, with great actors and attention for detail. They really tried to make something special. They failed at that though, but it is still worth a watch for the fans","This is not just another B-movie. And it aint another Bruce Willis flop either. Seriously. I have been watching ALL of Bruce Willis' movies lately and this one is actually not too bad. Not great either...but enjoyable enough for the Bruce Willis fans.Director Jesse V Johnson has proven to be able to make lots of solid, tough and enjoyable B-movies throughout the last years and this is another decent one.Excellent acting performance by Michael Rooker, who performs a leading role (baddie AND good guy in one), sharing a leading credit with Olga Kurlyenko, who is a highly skilled soldier.The story: Bruce Willis is a mobster boss who orders a cop (Olga Kurylenko) to be killed. All hell breaks loose after that, WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF SHOOTOUTS.This movie stands a bit out (in a good way) from other B-movies, because of the attention for detail, with good photography, a decent soundtrack and a story about family bonds.Any bad? It it a bit slow now and then. And there are some credibility issues in the story and direction. But I am nitpicking, because in the end this is simply a mindless action B-movie, with great actors starring in it. It'll do...At an important end note: This is one of Bruce Willis' LAST movies he will EVER make, because Bruce is retiring from acting, due to severe bad health, because he is suffering from a neurological disease which affects his speech and facial expressions. Really tragic!Let us not forget WHY we are watching Bruce Willis movies to begin with. We watch Bruce Willis movies because of DIE HARD (1988). THE ONE AND ONLY BIGGEST ACTION AMERICAN ACTION CLASSIC OF THE CENTURY.This classic is still standing strong after more than 30 years. Millions of people still REwatch it during every Christmas holiday. Recently a petition was launched to rename Nakatomi Plaza into DIE HARD plaza.A life time achievement award for Bruce Willis is in the making as well, so I have heard...DIE HARD (1988) NEVER DIES but is still ALIVE AND KICKING in 2022.Let's celebrate that...",solid b movie with great actors attention detail they really tried make something special they failed at that though but it is still worth watch fans,this is not just another b movie it aint another bruce willis flop either seriously i have been watching all bruce willis movies lately this one is actually not too bad not great either but enjoyable enough bruce willis fans director jesse v johnson has proven be able make lots solid tough enjoyable b movies throughout last years this is another decent one excellent acting performance by michael rooker who performs leading role baddie good guy one sharing leading credit with olga kurlyenko who is highly skilled soldier story bruce willis is mobster boss who orders cop olga kurylenko be killed all hell breaks loose after that with lots lots shootouts this movie stands bit out good way other b movies because attention detail with good photography decent soundtrack story about family bonds any bad it it bit slow now then there are some credibility issues story direction but i am nitpicking because end this is simply mindless action b movie with great actors starring it itll do at important end note this is one bruce willis last movies he will ever make because bruce is retiring acting due severe bad health because he is suffering neurological disease which affects his speech facial expressions really tragic let us not forget why we are watching bruce willis movies begin with we watch bruce willis movies because die hard 1988 one only biggest action american action classic century this classic is still standing strong after more than 30 years millions people still rewatch it during every christmas holiday recently petition was launched rename nakatomi plaza into die hard plaza life time achievement award bruce willis is making as well so i have heard die hard 1988 never dies but is still alive kicking 2022 lets celebrate that,0.4467406050739385,0.060796251074028876,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.23}"
6,White Elephant (2022) is a Heartfelt Send Off For Bruce Willis,"White Elephant (2022) is a Heartfelt Send Off For Bruce Willis. After announcing earlier this year that Bruce Willis would be stepping away from acting, due to his Aphasia diagnosis, it is hard not the watch White Elephant with that in mind. However, White Elephant is much more than a swan song to this beloved action star, it is a very good action romp.The film is the long delayed brain child of former stunt man, writer, and Director Jesse V. Johnson. The plot is simple-""When two cops witness an assassination attempt, a ruthless crime boss orders Gabriel Tancredi, an ex-Marine turned mob enforcer, to eliminate any and all threats."" However, like many Johnson films the plot is just the pretext for showcasing the rich characters and launching point for great action and violence.Johnson has a penchant for broken characters with characteristics that make it hards not to look past their awful deeds, and be romanced by them in their quasi-redemption. This is true whether he is is the writer and Director of his own material like Savage Dog, Accident Man, or the brilliant Debt Collector films; or whether he is Directing someone else's story, like Nina Bergman in the masterful, Hell Hath No Fury. Michael Rooker has the distinction of filling these shoes in White Elephant as the nearly retired, mob enforcer faced with a dramatic choice to do what he was hired to do, or do what he believes is right. This is his best performance, by far. He is very memorable in this role.Olga Kuryenko is equally broken as the subject of the mob's pursuit, and she does a good job holding her own as the tough cop fighting to survive. While not a true buddy film, she is a good compliment to Rooker.The supporting characters are well supported by a strong cast, many that afficionados of Johnson's films might recognize. Vadhir Derbez is very watchable as the young upstart looking to make a name for himself in the mob world. I couldn't help being reminded of Ross McCall's performance as another Gabriel Tancredi in Johnson's The Beautiful Ones, a very underrated film. John Malkovich has a small role as a mob lawyer, but not one second he is on the screen is wasted-this is Malkovich in top form.As for Willis-you can not un-know what you know about his medical condition while making this film. I read a lot of speculation and commentary about his performance in light of it. As for me I will refer to a prior review of a ""B"" rated, straight to video performance by Willis; ""When Bruce Willis is in the movie you almost always know what you are going to get and even when the film is bad there is still Bruce Willis."" Nothing has changed my opinion in this good film about Willis's performance.The cinematography, action, and violence is at the level you can expect from a Jesse V. Johnson film. No modern filmmaker can do more with a modest film budget (reported at $15 million) than Johnson. His films are fun to watch and White Elephant is no exception. Violence, gun play, and bloodshed abound, and is well placed.While I have been fortunate enough to interview Johnson twice I am still amazed at how deep his appreciation and homage to good film runs. This film has homage to other great films, old and newer, classics, and even to Johnson's prior films. Derbez's character opines, late in the film, that it ""is like a f@cking Western."" Yes, I would agree, White Elephant (2022) is a modern western, or, at least, a tribute to Westerns.I love Johnson films. I recommend White Elephant.White Elephant premiered on AMC+ and is streaming on multiple PPV services.",white elephant 2022 is heartfelt send off bruce willis,white elephant 2022 is heartfelt send off bruce willis after announcing earlier this year that bruce willis would be stepping away acting due his aphasia diagnosis it is hard not watch white elephant with that mind however white elephant is much more than swan song this beloved action star it is very good action romp film is long delayed brain child former stunt man writer director jesse v johnson plot is simple when two cops witness assassination attempt ruthless crime boss orders gabriel tancredi ex marine turned mob enforcer eliminate any all threats however like many johnson films plot is just pretext showcasing rich characters launching point great action violence johnson has penchant broken characters with characteristics that make it hards not look past their awful deeds be romanced by them their quasi redemption this is true whether he is is writer director his own material like savage dog accident man or brilliant debt collector films or whether he is directing someone elses story like nina bergman masterful hell hath no fury michael rooker has distinction filling these shoes white elephant as nearly retired mob enforcer faced with dramatic choice do what he was hired do or do what he believes is right this is his best performance by far he is very memorable this role olga kuryenko is equally broken as subject mobs pursuit she does good job holding her own as tough cop fighting survive while not true buddy film she is good compliment rooker supporting characters are well supported by strong cast many that afficionados johnsons films might recognize vadhir derbez is very watchable as young upstart looking make name himself mob world i couldnt help being reminded ross mccalls performance as another gabriel tancredi johnsons beautiful ones very underrated film john malkovich has small role as mob lawyer but not one second he is screen is wasted this is malkovich top form as willis you can not un know what you know about his medical condition while making this film i read lot speculation commentary about his performance light it as me i will refer prior review b rated straight video performance by willis when bruce willis is movie you almost always know what you are going get even when film is bad there is still bruce willis nothing has changed my opinion this good film about williss performance cinematography action violence is at level you can expect jesse v johnson film no modern filmmaker can do more with modest film budget reported at 15 million than johnson his films are fun watch white elephant is no exception violence gun play bloodshed abound is well placed while i have been fortunate enough interview johnson twice i am still amazed at how deep his appreciation homage good film runs this film has homage other great films old newer classics even johnsons prior films derbezs character opines late film that it is like f western yes i would agree white elephant 2022 is modern western or at least tribute westerns i love johnson films i recommend white elephant white elephant premiered amc is streaming multiple ppv services,0.44095518207282913,0.14645284780578896,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.44}"

2,I want my time back,"This was a raging pile of dung from the very start.

The characters exist to shoot guns and nothing more, and when the subject of morality introduced it's a split second conversation before more shooting.In fact most of the conversation in this film is characters rehashing the events you just saw, which is almost insultingly silly because it's as though the writer assumes you've seen none of what happened and need it explained twice or even three times in forced cutouts.Can't even give it points for the shootout scenes either because the characters are presented as tactical and experienced yet don't cover exits, shoot at nothing to kill their element of surprise and tip off the target, and then act shocked when the one they're after escapes for the fifth time.",i want my time back,this was raging pile dung very start movie itself isnt so much telling story as just having several events happen succession theres no character development whatsoever even at end film i couldnt root any side or connect any character at all because among all bullets shootouts deaths you never really meet anyone characters exist shoot guns nothing more when subject morality introduced its split second conversation before more shooting fact most conversation this film is characters rehashing events you just saw which is almost insultingly silly because its as though writer assumes youve seen none what happened need it explained twice or even three times forced cutouts cant even give it points shootout scenes either because characters are presented as tactical experienced yet dont cover exits shoot at nothing kill their element surprise tip off target then act shocked when one theyre after escapes fifth time,0.3791666666666667,0.06666666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.6}"

2,Watch Johnson's Hell Hath No Fury (2021) instead,"Last night I took in my first serving of Bruceploitation. Not to be confused with the Bruce Lee Bruceploitation, this is the subgenre of b-movies from the last few years where Bruce Willis shows up for basically extended cameos. I happily watched from the sidelines as my friend Mark endured them and I just lived vicariously via his hilarious reviews. But early on Mark started to sense something wrong and, sadly, it was confirmed this year that Willis is suffering from the brain disorder aphasia, given the films a whole new dour sheen. So why did I suddenly decide to dip my toe into these dark waters? Well, I am a fan of action director Jesse V. Johnson, who built a solid career on direct-to-video actioners and co-wrote and directed this film.Michael Rooker stars as Gabriel Tancredi, the top hitman for real estate magnate/crime lord Arnold (Bruce Willis). His latest assignment is two cops after they witness Tancredi's understudy pull off a hit. They quickly dispatch of the male half, but have more trouble with trouble war vet Vanessa (Olga Kurylenko). And, wouldn't you know it, Tancredi turns out to be the cliche ""hitman with a heart of gold"" and soon turns on his employer to protect her. His reasoning? She has the same birthdate as his deceased wife! Johnson has built a pretty solid career with direct-to-video actioners and with Isaac Florentine seemingly sidelined, he might be my favorite action director working nowadays. Unfortunately, this is his sloppiest film to date, suffering from a threadbare plot that is still overstuffed with cliches and some of the shoddiest looping I've heard in a long time. You will not believe your ears when you hear some of the attempts to imitate John Malkovich and Willis. Speaking of the latter, it is really tough to watch him, even if you didn't know his medical issue. No matter how hard they try to cover it, he is clearly not in the moment and only given simple lines like ""I want them dead."" It was obviously a ""get him in and out"" situation, so much so that there is one dialogue scene with an over-the-shoulder shot of Willis' character and it clearly isn't him. They just didn't care. There are several violent shootouts, but they are marred by ""enhancing"" squibs with CGI blood, villains who unload magazines but don't hit anyone, and some of the dumbest character moves ever (my favorite being a ferocious shootout in a motel parking lot where the manager walks out and screeches ""What the hell's going on out here?""). This will be my first and last dip into the murky Willis DTV waters. As for Johnson, I recommend you check out his much more superior World War II set Hell Hath No Fury (2021) from last year that shows he knows how to get the most out of his budget and tell an engaging story.",watch johnsons hell hath no fury 2021 instead,last night i took my first serving bruceploitation not be confused with bruce lee bruceploitation this is subgenre b movies last few years where bruce willis shows up basically extended cameos i happily watched sidelines as my friend mark endured them i just lived vicariously via his hilarious reviews but early mark started sense something wrong sadly it was confirmed this year that willis is suffering brain disorder aphasia given films whole new dour sheen so why did i suddenly decide dip my toe into these dark waters well i am fan action director jesse v johnson who built solid career direct video actioners co wrote directed this film michael rooker stars as gabriel tancredi top hitman real estate magnate crime lord arnold bruce willis his latest assignment is two cops after they witness tancredis understudy pull off hit they quickly dispatch male half but have more trouble with trouble war vet vanessa olga kurylenko wouldnt you know it tancredi turns out be cliche hitman with heart gold soon turns his employer protect her his reasoning she has same birthdate as his deceased wife johnson has built pretty solid career with direct video actioners with isaac florentine seemingly sidelined he might be my favorite action director working nowadays unfortunately this is his sloppiest film date suffering threadbare plot that is still overstuffed with cliches some shoddiest looping ive heard long time you will not believe your ears when you hear some attempts imitate john malkovich willis speaking latter it is really tough watch him even if you didnt know his medical issue no matter how hard they try cover it he is clearly not moment only given simple lines like i want them dead it was obviously get him out situation so much so that there is one dialogue scene with over shoulder shot willis character it clearly isnt him they just didnt care there are several violent shootouts but they are marred by enhancing squibs with cgi blood villains who unload magazines but dont hit anyone some dumbest character moves ever my favorite being ferocious shootout motel parking lot where manager walks out screeches what hells going out here this will be my first last dip into murky willis dtv waters as johnson i recommend you check out his much more superior world war ii set hell hath no fury 2021 last year that shows he knows how get most out his budget tell engaging story,0.463899196042053,0.07361562049062051,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.44}"

4,And the Oscar for Worst Actor goes to Bruce Willis,"This could have been a decent movie but it's like someone dared Bruce Willis to do the worst job he could.

4,Is there a plot?,"If there was an actual plot, it was certainly not clear or really all that important, I suppose. Guns, shoot ups, with only the bad guys getting killed. If it weren't for a cast of well-known actors, this moves would have been C grade effort. It is SO Hollywood for the good guys to face off against terrible odds, like machine guns firing at them and still they don't get shot. The instruction to Hollywood bad guys is to stand still and don't fight back, until it says so in the script! I get that Bruce is facing serious health challenges. It is nice that he has a chance for a fund raiser before he leaves.
