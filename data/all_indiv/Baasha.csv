,Where are all the fans?,"I am amazed that not one of Superstar Rajinikanth's millions of fans in the whole wide world has bothered to write a review of what is arguably his greatest hit and possibly his best entertainer. Like legions of his fans, I cannot find a single flaw in this superb flick. It's like a Bond movie; everything's possible because 007 is in charge. Rajini as Manickam and Badsha is simply scintillating; he gives his most impressive Bond-like performance to date. Actually I think Superstar should have quit films and entered politics after Badsha - he would have left in a blaze of glory and cemented his place in film and political history. There are many unforgettable scenes - when he speaks to the college principal for his sister's admission, the fight with Anandaraj (""ULLE PO""), all his scenes with Raghuvaran. I can go on and on. Instead I'll go and watch Badsha again.

9.0,Rajini's breakout role,"Rajini might have done over 100 films prior to this one,but if there's one film which catapulted him to demi god status,it has to be this one.His characterisation as the calm and docile Manickam coupled with the stylish and ruthless don Baasha makes this movie a treat to watch.The story might not be great,the BG is a rip off from Terminator,the music and songs are cheesy,Nagma is useless,the production value is tacky(OK,granted this was 1995).But,if there's one person who makes this movie unbelievably watchable it has to be Rajinikanth.This might sound insane,but I have seen this movie more than 30 times(I stopped counting after 30)and each viewing is still enjoyable.I can't say the same for most movies,Rajini's other movies included.There is something special in this film which is hard to explain.Time for another Baasha session.",rajinis breakout role,rajini might have done over 100 films prior this one but if theres one film which catapulted him demi god status it has be this one his characterisation as calm docile manickam coupled with stylish ruthless don baasha makes this movie treat watch story might not be great bg is rip off terminator music songs are cheesy nagma is useless production value is tacky ok granted this was 1995 but if theres one person who makes this movie unbelievably watchable it has be rajinikanth this might sound insane but i have seen this movie more than 30 times i stopped counting after 30 each viewing is still enjoyable i cant say same most movies rajinis other movies included there is something special this film which is hard explain time another baasha session,0.6007275132275133,0.03835978835978836,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.24, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.12}"

10.0,Tamil Cinima's Epiphany,"If there ever was a poster for Tamil Commercial Cinema, this would be it and if there ever was a star who could wield the South Indian box office dynamics by merely starring in a movie, it was and it will be(for ever) Thalaivar Rajinikanth. This movie is for Tamil Cinema; what Sholay is to Bollywood and what Gone with the Wind is for Hollywood, a classic that would never get old for eons.This movie follows a classic three act structure with an inventive twist. Manickam(Rajinikanth) is a peace loving auto driver who wants to provide a respectable life to all his step siblings. He gets his one of the younger sister married to a respectable family. He helps his another sister to get an admission in a medical college and his younger brother a police officer job. He does all this honestly. Even though he runs into trouble with local goons time and again he never turns to violence. His brother gets in trouble with one of the local goon called Indran. Indran traps his brother and threatens to assault him fatally.Manickam offers to get beaten in his brother's place . He does not even flinch while those goons beat him to pulp and moreover laughs at the end when his brother questions his stupidity. Even though each and every viewer inherently knows Manickam would retaliate sometime, we would sympathize with the character for his sacrifice.Finally, when Indran tries to molest his sister to avenge Manickam's brother. According to Indian culture(movie culture also), women are highly respected and molesting one's sister, mother or wife would generally bring out the worst in a man. Thats what audience want too. Manickam gets violent for the first time. This movement when Manickam hits one of the sidekicks of Indran and he flies off for what seems to be few yards, marks the high adrenaline, action packed, nerve throbbing performance of Thalaivar as Basha and Rajini's Box Office Supremacy. This particular scene is shot so well, that it is the example by which many punctuating action scenes in the Tamil and Telugu cinema are shot even today. A right mixture of silence, music, lighting and editing makes this violent scene all the more exciting ,memorable and possibly poetic. The only other scene in Tamil Cinema which could almost match the adrenaline rush of this scene would be one another scene by Thalaivar in Padayappa, where he sits on a swing(sounds simple! yet you would have to be Thalaivar's fan to experience this free Ecstasy).Following this much awaited and welcomed outburst of Manickam, we are introduced to his alter ego in flashback, Basha. Rajini's getup as Basha was so stylish and sophisticated, his image as Basha is what most of his fans might remember him. Basha, is a mafia don of Bombay, whose only ambition is to destroy another evil don Antony. As far as any action commercial cinema goes, its the strength of the villain that makes the movie and not that of hero's. Raghuvaran(who played Antony) gave such a performance as Antony, that he cemented his character as a legend of celluloid villainy. He was equally sophisticated, stylized and articulate as the hero of the movie. At the high point of their battle Antony looses to Basha and is arrested by police. Basha, according to his promise to his dad leaves Bombay after staging his own death and lives a simple life of Manickam in Chennai.In the climax, Antony learns that Basha is still alive in Chennai and escapes from Bombay prison to avenge Basha and gets killed in the end.The movie had an effect of a fantasy movie of Hollywood worth millions of dollars, with just Thalaivar's menacing looks, snappy dialogues and thumping background score. The dialogues in this movie gave rise to new form of dialogues in Tamil cinema called punch. A punch is basically a comparatively small catchy phrase, which is capable of communicating a much larger meaning. One such punch which became so popular that, literally every kid in the state was reciting it on a day to day basis was-""Na oru thadava sonna nooru thadava sonna mathiri"", whose literal meaning is ""If i say once, Its like i have said it 100 times"". It might sound stupid, but in a weird thalaivar's connotation it means a lot to fans and cine goers alike. Apart from dialogue, the movie had a pretty impressive background score. They had borrowed Terminator's theme music as theme music for Basha, which also helped in elevating Rajini's appearance in each and every frame. That being confessed, every aspect of the movie, from story, screenplay, direction, music, costumes, cinematography changed the landscape of South Indian Commercial Movie for ever. This movie showed what happens when every one working in a movie tries to accentuate what Rajini could do on screen. This movie elevated Rajini from stardom to a demigod status. This was such a success through out South India that Rajini was considered to be the next Star turned Politician(after M.G. Ramachandran and Miss Jayalalitha) who would rule Tamil Nadu in future. People of Tamil Nadu literally went berserk over this movie, including myself(i was around 9 years old at that time).Tamil Cinema's history can never be complete with out this classic. Even though its just a pure entertaining ,commercial, action flick. Tamil audience witnessed the birth of a demigod called Thalaivar in this movie. This movie pushed the boundaries for Tamil Cinema and made it commercially viable to produce big budget Tamil movies, which were otherwise done by Bollywood alone. Whole Tamil Industry owes a lot(for big budget movies and crappy masala flicks) to this movie and its star Rajini. Nobody can replace Rajini in Tamil pop culture and no movie can replace Basha in the annals of Tamil Cinema.",tamil cinimas epiphany,if there ever was poster tamil commercial cinema this would be it

6.0,An updated version of 'Hum' provides an action-packed blockbuster to Rajinikanth.,"Baashha (1995) : Brief Review -An updated version of 'Hum' provides an action-packed blockbuster to Rajinikanth. Baashha is one of the most successful films of Rajinikanth's career and also very popular one among masses. The film is an adaption of Bollywood film 'Hum', in which Rajinikanth also plays one of the major role but in Baashha he plays the lead role to steal all the limelight. Rajinikanth plays an auto driver, Manikam, who desperately tries to hide his dark underworld side to keep his promise to his father. However, circumstances force him to return in baddie Avatar of Manik Baashha and then we get to see his backstory. Baashha is a very entertaining massy film, not only for Rajini fans but for all the mass cinema lovers. It has those cliches with perfect timing and commercial branding that takes masses on storm. It's not just that but there's that transformation part too which makes it more interesting. It might be an predictable affair because we all know these conflicts already. A kind hearted gangster turned into a gentleman and then has to return to old days under the family circumstances. We have seen it many times and it was quite outdated for mid 90s when Kamal Haasan and Mohanlal were bringing solid content in the same mass-action genre. So, there is nothing much to expect from the story but it is pretty much amusing film. Rajinikanth gets a role that suits his macho image perfectly. Nagma looks Super Hot whereas the supporting cast is decent. The songs are average but very glamorous. Suresh Krissna makes a sure short blockbuster product despite typical formulation of the story. That's more than enough i guess, i mean delivering a watchable product with a repeated content is still a fine work. Overall, an enjoyable mass film, just ignore the high ratings given by die hard fans.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",updated version hum provides action packed blockbuster rajinikanth,baashha 1995 brief review updated version hum provides action packed blockbuster rajinikanth baashha is one most successful films rajinikanths career also very popular one among masses film is adaption bollywood film hum which rajinikanth also plays one major role but baashha he plays lead role steal all limelight rajinikanth plays auto driver manikam who desperately tries hide his dark underworld side keep his promise his father however circumstances force him return baddie avatar manik baashha then we get see his backstory baashha is very entertaining massy film not only rajini fans but all mass cinema lovers it has those cliches with perfect timing commercial branding that takes masses storm its not just that but theres that transformation part too which makes it more interesting it might be predictable affair because we all know these conflicts already kind hearted gangster turned into gentleman then has return old days under family circumstances we have seen it many times it was quite outdated mid 90s when kamal haasan mohanlal were bringing solid content same mass action genre so there is nothing much expect story but it is pretty much amusing film rajinikanth gets role that suits his macho image perfectly nagma looks super hot whereas supporting cast is decent songs are average but very glamorous suresh krissna makes sure short blockbuster product despite typical formulation story thats more than enough i guess i mean delivering watchable product with repeated content is still fine work overall enjoyable mass film just ignore high ratings given by die hard fans rating 6 10 by,0.5142901234567901,0.21774074074074068,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,One of the Best of Rajinis Movie,"Rajinikanth plays the role of Maanik Badsha wherein he rules the city of Mumbai and opposes the villain Antony(Mark Antony - Raghuvaran) for all his ill acts towards the innocent public and the cruel murder of his best friend Badsha.Once Raghuvaran gets arrested for charges - Maanik Badsha changes his name back to Maanickam(his original name in the movie) and tries to lead a normal life back in Chennai as a Auto driver. But at times it is required for him to reveal his identity to face the local dhaadhaas and he does that with class. For instance - His sis goes to college administration office for getting seat to study medicals and the administration office guy(some big shot), asks her to come to his guest house for sexual favour in return of the college seat allocation. Sis returns to Rajini and informs about him about the incident and cries, the scenes following the same wherein he visits the admin guy and reveals his past still brings in nerve chilling effect when thought of. Such is the impact Rajini has on our thoughts and imagination too...:). So goes the film but his own brother who becomes Police officer tries to unviel Badsha's identity and following that Antony in jail comes to know Badsha is alive and so when he gets released he again tries to take revenge on Rajini and gets defeated and killed in the final battle.Nagma plays the heroin role as a rich mans daughter. Her dad was related to Antony in the past and was behind the assacination of Antony's family members. Thus the story is well knit together.The dialogue 'Naan Oru Mura Sonna Nooru Mura Sonna Madhiri' became one of the best punch dialogues of Rajini and even in 2010 a child born 5 years back will utter the same with pride and craze. I personally watched this movie more than 10 times and each time I watched it, it was full of energy, style and RAJINI. We love him. Yes we people are crazy about Rajini and least bothered what others think about us. When he's on-screen we forget ourselves off-screen, thats RAJINI. Wish Him Good Luck for his currently running movie Enthiran which is creating records in the history of Indian films and wish him good luck for his personal life too.",one best rajinis movie,rajinikanth plays role maanik badsha wherein he rules city mumbai opposes villain antony mark antony raghuvaran all his ill acts towards innocent public cruel murder his best friend badsha once raghuvaran gets arrested charges maanik badsha changes his name back maanickam his original name movie tries lead normal life back chennai as auto driver but at times it is required him reveal his identity face local dhaadhaas he does that with class instance his sis goes college administration office getting seat study medicals administration office guy some big shot asks her come his guest house sexual favour return college seat allocation sis returns rajini informs about him about incident cries scenes following same wherein he visits admin guy reveals his past still brings nerve chilling effect when thought such is impact rajini has our thoughts imagination too so goes film but his own brother who becomes police officer tries unviel badshas identity following that antony jail comes know badsha is alive so when he gets released he again tries take revenge rajini gets defeated killed final battle nagma plays heroin role as rich mans daughter her dad was related antony past was behind assacination antonys family members thus story is well knit together dialogue naan oru mura sonna nooru mura sonna madhiri became one best punch dialogues rajini even 2010 child born 5 years back will utter same with pride craze i personally watched this movie more than 10 times each time i watched it it was full energy style rajini we love him yes we people are crazy about rajini least bothered what others think about us when hes screen we forget ourselves off screen thats rajini wish him good luck his currently running movie enthiran which is creating records history indian films wish him good luck his personal life too,0.4433333333333334,0.08777777777777779,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
