9.0,"Do yourself a favor – Watch ""Nil Battey Sannata"" to get inspired and motivated","Everyone has dreams which basically creates a purpose in life in order to achieve your dream. You need to believe in your dreams, cherish and protect them and make sure nobody takes it away from you. ""Nil Battey Sannata"", meaning 'knowing nothing', talks about dream a mother has for her child. The riveting drama was felicitated at Silk Road International Film Festival which is an equivalent to Oscar awards in China where Swara Bhaskar won the Best Actress Award. So, is ""Nil Battey Sannata"" worth your time and money ? Well, let us find out..""Nil Battey Sannata"" is a coming-of-age drama of Apu (Ria Shukla) who finally grows up to become a IPS officer after her mother Chanda (Swara Bhaskar) sacrifices and struggles in her journey of motherhood to make sure she lives her dream of giving Apu a bright future.Directed by debutant Ashwini Iyer Tiwari, ""Nil Battey Sannata"" is a sparkling film in every context. Right from the beginning of the film, you will be completely engrossed into the beautiful tale of mother and her struggle to keep her dreams alive. Blended with sarcasm and light moments, the film is a powerful drama which will help you sail it through 2 hours without getting bored. Told in a subtle manner, it is the simplicity of narration which is the highlight of the film and you will cherish each and every frame. There are no glossy sets, colorful costumes over-the-tone melodrama yet the film is entertaining and will keep you glued throughout. The screenplay is pivotal defines each and every characters to the core. Couple of scenes do stand out in the first half. The first scene at the school where the students gets punished for violating the rules of the school, the scene where the Pankaj Tripathi is surprised after Ratna Pathaka convinces Swara Bhaskar to join as student and the scene at Collector's house between Swara Bhaskar and guards are hilarious. Hats off to Ashwini Iyer Tiwari for standing out in her first film itself. She definitely has the merits to go long with her impeccable direction.On the flip side, the climax is predictable and could have made it more appealing but the enduring performances by the star cast will leave you satisfied in the end. Music, generally used in background, is tuneful and gels well with the mood of the film. Cinematography is spellbinding capturing the essence of Agra in its beautiful frame. Art direction is brilliant. Dialogues are punching.Performance wise, Swara Bhaskar steals the thunder with her electrifying performance. The ""Tanu Weds Manu"" actor is just growing better with each film. Surprisingly, this is her first film as a lead and she has displayed matured acting. Watch for her. She definitely has long way to go. Pankaj Tripathi and Ratna Pathak are brilliant as usual. Ria Shukla does well in her role.Overall, ""Nil Battey Sannata"" is a feel-good cinema with a strong and captivating message. Do yourself a favor – Watch ""Nil Battey Sannata"" to get inspired and motivated.

9.0,Selfless Love of a Mother can do wonders!,"Excellent film!A motivational film where a mother motivates her daughter to do something worthwhile in life.The mother is just a 'kaam wali bai' (maid, helper) plus she does many other kinds of odd jobs so that she can educate her daughter to become something – either a doctor or engineer!But the daughter was least interested in studies! She had befriended couple of weak students of her class and all they rather loved it when the teacher sent them out of the class as punishment.She got poor grades and she was more interested to watch TV and paste the pictures of her favourite actors! Her mother was ambitious to see her daughter do something much better than her at least. When she asks her daughter as to what she wants to become in future, she replied that she wanted to become a governess or nanny because they pay well! This shocked her mother and circumstances were then created in such a manner that the daughter slowly and gradually becomes interested in studies, makes friends with intelligent students of the class – plus even her weak friends got interested in studies!She later hacks the IAS examination !Movie showed the power of positive motivation and also the fact that in order to motivate someone, you need not be some Oxford pass out but just plain simple – even less educated person but with a heart full of love and a firm belief that hard work and patience will definitely show results!**the word Nil is zero, battey - divided by and sannata is again nothing or zero .. so the answer 'become nothing' or 'become zero, the infinite'.",selfless love mother can do wonders,excellent film motivational film where mother motivates her daughter do something worthwhile life mother is just kaam wali bai maid helper plus she does many other kinds odd jobs so that she can educate her daughter become something either doctor or engineer but daughter was least interested studies she had befriended couple weak students her class all they rather loved it when teacher sent them out class as punishment she got poor grades she was more interested watch tv paste pictures her favourite actors her mother was ambitious see her daughter do something much better than her at least when she asks her daughter as what she wants become future she replied that she wanted become governess or nanny because they pay well this shocked her mother circumstances were then created such manner that daughter slowly gradually becomes interested studies makes friends with intelligent students class plus even her weak friends got interested studies she later hacks ias examination movie showed power positive motivation also fact that order motivate someone you need not be some oxford pass out but just plain simple even less educated person but with heart full love firm belief that hard work patience will definitely show results word nil is zero battey divided by sannata is again nothing or zero so answer become nothing or become zero infinite,0.49051638837353123,0.10322820037105752,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Feel-good Film,"Films with a social message are usually loud and boring. Nil Battey Sannata is a glorious exception. It is a very engaging film on girls' education.Chanda Sahay has big dreams for her daughter Apu and toils daily as a housemaid and does odd jobs in various sweat shops. On the other hand, Apu who is in class 10 is least interested in school and keeps repeating that her ambition is to become a Bai like her mother. Mother and daughter constantly bicker over this. Chanda's employer, the kind and wise Dr Deewan (Ratna Phatak Shah), comes up with an artful plan and gets Chanda admitted to the same class as Apu. This leads to even more friction and a bit of competition between mother and daughter. Their weakness is maths and a boy, suitably looking nerdy in thick glasses, helps them get over their fear with some astonishing mnemonics.There are plenty of emotion charged scenes, and if you find your eyes getting wet, it is not because the film is manipulative but because of brilliant scripting and endearing performances. Swara Bhaskar as Chanda and Riya Shukla as Apu are both excellent. Pankaj Tripathi's comically stern principal is a splendid cameo. The title of the film literally means zero divided by zero and is a local idiom for an idiot. There are a couple of irritants, which I don't want to pick on in what is essentially a very heartwarming and feel-good film. I would recommend that you take along your domestic helps to watch it.",feel good film,films with social message are usually loud boring nil battey sannata is glorious exception it is very engaging film girls education chanda sahay has big dreams her daughter apu toils daily as housemaid does odd jobs various sweat shops other hand apu who is class 10 is least interested school keeps repeating that her ambition is become bai like her mother mother daughter constantly bicker over this chandas employer kind wise dr deewan ratna phatak shah comes up with artful plan gets chanda admitted same class as apu this leads even more friction bit competition between mother daughter their weakness is maths boy suitably looking nerdy thick glasses helps them get over their fear with some astonishing mnemonics there are plenty emotion charged scenes if you find your eyes getting wet it is not because film is manipulative but because brilliant scripting endearing performances swara bhaskar as chanda riya shukla as apu are both excellent pankaj tripathis comically stern principal is splendid cameo title film literally means zero divided by zero is local idiom idiot there are couple irritants which i dont want pick what is essentially very heartwarming feel good film i would recommend that you take along your domestic helps watch it,0.5543548387096776,0.20306451612903226,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.34, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,An amazing script amalgamated with wonderful acting and direction.,"If you want to experience the magic of amazing scriptwriting combined with great acting and direction, this is the ticket to that wonderland. Right from the start, the cinematography gels with the script. Although it slows down for plot development, but then picks up gracefully again. It's a wonderfully crafted journey that steals your eye control and certainly your heart.Producer Aanand Rai has marvelously mentored the debutant director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari. After his stint of great movies, here comes a masterpiece in his first production venture. Ashwiny has shown great efforts and I'll take nothing away from him. It's hard to see such a masterclass in a debutant. The way amalgamation of script and actors have been done is simply amazing.Rising from the supporting character roles, Swara Bhaskar grabbed this lead opportunity with open hands. She is very impressive and her body language is perfect all through. Little girl Riya Shukla steals the heart right from the start and continues to do so throughout.Overall, an amazing script amalgamated with wonderful acting and direction.",amazing script amalgamated with wonderful acting direction,if you want experience magic amazing scriptwriting combined with great acting direction this is ticket that wonderland right start cinematography gels with script although it slows down plot development but then picks up gracefully again its wonderfully crafted journey that steals your eye control certainly your heart producer aanand rai has marvelously mentored debutant director ashwiny iyer tiwari after his stint great movies here comes masterpiece his first production venture ashwiny has shown great efforts ill take nothing away him its hard see such masterclass debutant way amalgamation script actors have been done is simply amazing rising supporting character roles swara bhaskar grabbed this lead opportunity with open hands she is very impressive her body language is perfect all through little girl riya shukla steals heart right start continues do so throughout overall amazing script amalgamated with wonderful acting direction,0.6347153804050356,0.3948617952928297,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.52, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.18}"
8.0,A moral filled wonderful movie,"Nil Battey Sannata which means good for nothing and thats how the movie describes about one of main characters Apeksha played wonderfully by debutant Riya Shukla.Apeksha which means expectation but unfortunately the girl has no dreams or expectations with life. Her belief is that her mother Chanda is a servant and she will also become a servant like her mother as her mother has no money to educate her for higher studies. And when she ends up getting poor grades in maths, Chanda joins her class as a student and challenge her to study.What i really loved about this movie is the director and writer show reality in the film. It not hard hitting but a fact of life. Chanda does multiple jobs to sustain her family. We don't know much about her husband and yet inspite of all troubles, she wants to educate her daughter and make her a doctor or engineer. I liked the scene where she gets noodles to celebrate her daughter's success. Yet when her daughter is doing badly in Maths, she re-joins school and becomes a competitor to her daughter. When he daughter breaks the bet, she decides to teach her daughter a lesson. As for her daughter, Apeksha, she is the least bothered kid who just wants to waste time and has no dream and ambition. She is selfish and fails to see her mother's sacrifices. There is also a nice part in the movie where Chanda accidentally meets the District Collector and stalks him wanting to know how he became one. Also, the chats between Chanda and one of her employers, a doctor are nicely written.Swara Bhaskar dons the role of Chanda with ease and confidence. Even with the age against here..she is pulls of a brilliant performance. Its high time that the Chopras and Johars give her a chance in big commercial projects.New comer Riya is another star in the making and we should watch out for her.Ratna Pathak Shah who plays the doctor and Vishal Nath who plays Chanda and Apeksha's geeky classmate do commendable jobs.And finally there is Pankaj Tripathi who plays the school principal. He is one hell of an actor who makes the character look serious and well as funny. He doesn't make it a caricature. The one scene he stands out is in the beginning of the film where the new academic year has started and the assembly is going on.The movie teaches a few lessons about life and yet it never becomes preachy or emotional. And thats its strength. This movie should be watched by parents and children together.",moral filled wonderful movie,nil battey sannata which means good nothing thats how movie describes about one main characters apeksha played wonderfully by debutant riya shukla apeksha which means expectation but unfortunately girl has no dreams or expectations with life her belief is that her mother chanda is servant she will also become servant like her mother as her mother has no money educate her higher studies when she ends up getting poor grades maths chanda joins her class as student challenge her study what i really loved about this movie is director writer show reality film it not hard hitting but fact life chanda does multiple jobs sustain her family we dont know much about her husband yet inspite all troubles she wants educate her daughter make her doctor or engineer i liked scene where she gets noodles celebrate her daughters success yet when her daughter is doing badly maths she re joins school becomes competitor her daughter when he daughter breaks bet she decides teach her daughter lesson as her daughter apeksha she is least bothered kid who just wants waste time has no dream ambition she is selfish fails see her mothers sacrifices there is also nice part movie where chanda accidentally meets district collector stalks him wanting know how he became one also chats between chanda one her employers doctor are nicely written swara bhaskar dons role chanda with ease confidence even with age against here she is pulls brilliant performance its high time that chopras johars give her chance big commercial projects new comer riya is another star making we should watch out her ratna pathak shah who plays doctor vishal nath who plays chanda apekshas geeky classmate do commendable jobs finally there is pankaj tripathi who plays school principal he is one hell actor who makes character look serious well as funny he doesnt make it caricature one scene he stands out is beginning film where new academic year has started assembly is going movie teaches few lessons about life yet it never becomes preachy or emotional thats its strength this movie should be watched by parents children together,0.5231736281736282,0.13005118755118758,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.49}"
8.0,Light & Nice - Filled with heartful moments,Generally light and nice this movie has received positive reviews. Amongst the few reasons to watch is the direction and acting talent at show by Swara Bhaskar and Ratna Pathak Shah. After a recent release its an extreme delight to see actors like Ratna Pathak Shah playing again. Exceptional talent here displayed by both actors. The movie has an usual story of a woman struggling seeking to educate her daughter earn a respectable life different from her own. Although there is no melodrama there are scenes in the movie good enough to stir your emotions in every possible way. The scenes such as the one where Chanda is taken to meet the school headmaster are one amongst the ones really appreciating.,light nice filled with heartful moments,generally light nice this movie has received positive reviews amongst few reasons watch is direction acting talent at show by swara bhaskar ratna pathak shah after recent release its extreme delight see actors like ratna pathak shah playing again exceptional talent here displayed by both actors movie has usual story woman struggling seeking educate her daughter earn respectable life different her own although there is no melodrama there are scenes movie good enough stir your emotions every possible way scenes such as one where chanda is taken meet school headmaster are one amongst ones really appreciating,0.5974025974025973,0.2318542568542568,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,One of the best movie to come out of Bollywood.,"The acting was superb, direction and the screenplay was good too. The movie was so realistic unlike most of the school based movies, this was centered in a govt school where most of the India get educated. The movie is an inspiration for people with few resources and high hopes and dreams. It will motivate you to walk that extra mile to achieve your dreams. The movie is also an answer to those who always blame their fortune, financial status and let them come in between them and their dreams. The film also shows the eternal love of a mother towards her child and how she sacrifices her life to provide her child with all the comfort which she herself was deprived from. I loved the setting of this movie. It felt so realistic and beautiful. Plus the characters were so inspiring like the math genius Amar and the District collector. The sad part is these kinda movies don't make much in the box office. The audience prefer crap like prdp, wanted, dabangg. Movies with no moral and no sense at all. I hope makers of this, masaan, manjhi, gangs of wasseyur don't stop making these for they don' make enough in the box office. because someone has to keep making these to keep our faith alive in Bollywood.",one best movie come out bollywood,acting was superb direction screenplay was good too movie was so realistic unlike most school based movies this was centered govt school where most india get educated movie is inspiration people with few resources high hopes dreams it will motivate you walk that extra mile achieve your dreams movie is also answer those who always blame their fortune financial status let them come between them their dreams film also shows eternal love mother towards her child how she sacrifices her life provide her child with all comfort which she herself was deprived i loved setting this movie it felt so realistic beautiful plus characters were so inspiring like math genius amar district collector sad part is these kinda movies dont make much box office audience prefer crap like prdp wanted dabangg movies with no moral no sense at all i hope makers this masaan manjhi gangs wasseyur dont stop making these they don make enough box office because someone has keep making these keep our faith alive bollywood,0.4934848484848485,0.25196969696969695,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.19}"

,Nil battey Sannata - The Complex Journey of a Simple Life. By Rajesh Sharma,"A film that released in April 2016 back home. Even though I so wanted to view it, could not get the chance then. But then, as they say all good things come to those who wait. Managed to see it recently. Revolving around a mother-daughter duo, this simple story has taken on itself the job of answering so many questions that we face in our very own lives and seldom challenge ourselves to find the answers to.Swara-BhaskarThe ever talented #SwaraBhaskar plays a single mother, uneducated and someone who moves earth and skies to make ends meet. A sweet girl called Riya Shukla plays her 10th Class daughter.For every parent, their child is always the dearest to them. Then why does this very child become an irritant at times, with the passing years? Why do we lose our cool every now and then, with the same child we were swooning about? The film has tried to identify and portray this transition and maybe also provide answers to the viewers.Personally, I feel there is a very thin line which defines the relation. And on crossing the same its no more a parent and child relationship. It becomes a relationship between two human beings. And along with that comes jealousy, competition, opposition and One-upmanship. Sounds bad right? Dwelve within to discover where you stand. No one comes clean, maybe not even me.But the answer lies in sticking behind the line, on your side. And its only through your experience and wisdom, can you possibly identify it.Its a great story of a mother challenging her own self to change her daughter's destiny. A journey of not just change, but also self-discovery. A journey of endless possibilities which are awaiting to be tapped by those who dare and those who try.Amazing portrayal by all. Swara is a great performer, as always. Supported aptly by Riya, who herself has done a fantastic job. Very natural. And then we have the talented Ratna Pathak Shah and Pankaj Tripathi. The film packages various emotions from your childhood days (best recalled by those who did schooling in 1970s and 1980s). Found shades from my nostalgic past to enliven my thoughts and emotions.Great job Ahwiny Iyer Tiwari! Loved the movie and will look forward to more gems from your side in the future.View it.

6.0,Whispering tender emotions,"Director Mrs. Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari work is good. She has kept the realistic look and emotions intact with correct shots and way of narration. Story is very thin by Nitesh Tiwari. Screenplay by Pranjal Choudhary, Neeraj Singh, Director herself and Nitesh Tiwar is good and fresh. Dialogues are superb. Sorry I just forgot the name and couldn't find on net even. They are witty and enhances the character with pinch of humor. Starting twenty minutes is just amazing but then due to lack of sub plots, screenplay moves in circular motion. Principal first class with using 'Ghoda' metaphor is so sweet. Film sarcasms on coaching system with line that weak students need coaching more but they give discounts to high scoring students. Emotional quotient with mother and daughter is very good, well written, well shot and well enacted. Daughter acceptance scene in pre climax in class is very good. Direct admission in tenth class and of an adult is little filmy but its OK. Film slows down a bit in second half because of flat scenes and story not moving forward. Pre climax has good emotional balanced tone. Performance wise Swara Bhaskar as Chanda Sahay, (mother) is amazing. Its hard to believe that she was acting. Her improvisation is so cute in so many scenes on of them with her employer doctor, when she says ""Ab Baal Bhi Kha Jaiye"" is very appropriate and goes well with the mood of film. Ria Shukla as Apeksha Sahay, (Daughter) is impressive. Pankaj Tripathi as principal is outstanding. He can dig out scope for acting either it is there on paper or not. He doesn't has much scope but again he is superb. Ratna Pathak is another great actor, as doctor she is very good. School boy Pintu acted by Prashant Tiwari is good. Without doubt film is full of great performance, credit goes to actors as well director and casting director Mukesh Chhabra.",whispering tender emotions,director mrs ashwiny iyer tiwari work is good she has kept realistic look emotions intact with correct shots way narration story is very thin by nitesh tiwari screenplay by pranjal choudhary neeraj singh director herself nitesh tiwar is good fresh dialogues are superb sorry i just forgot name couldnt find net even they are witty enhances character with pinch humor starting twenty minutes is just amazing but then due lack sub plots screenplay moves circular motion principal first class with using ghoda metaphor is so sweet film sarcasms coaching system with line that weak students need coaching more but they give discounts high scoring students emotional quotient with mother daughter is very good well written well shot well enacted daughter acceptance scene pre climax class is very good direct admission tenth class adult is little filmy but its ok film slows down bit second half because flat scenes story not moving forward pre climax has good emotional balanced tone performance wise swara bhaskar as chanda sahay mother is amazing its hard believe that she was acting her improvisation is so cute so many scenes them with her employer doctor when she says ab baal bhi kha jaiye is very appropriate goes well with mood film ria shukla as apeksha sahay daughter is impressive pankaj tripathi as principal is outstanding he can dig out scope acting either it is there paper or not he doesnt has much scope but again he is superb ratna pathak is another great actor as doctor she is very good school boy pintu acted by prashant tiwari is good without doubt film is full great performance credit goes actors as well director casting director mukesh chhabra,0.5700827423167848,0.32575059101654846,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"
6.0,A low profile non star cast movie with a nice message and moments.....,"""Neel Battey Sannata"", this unfamiliar and inquisitive title, means a zero or worthless. Due to a low profile and a non star cast of the film, it won't find much of viewership, which is a sad part as this film deserves a better reach. The film through its simply told story very strongly advocates the importance of education, and by the end fills the story with a strong emotional bonding of a mother and daughter. The film deals with the characters who are very poor, who making a living out of washing dishes. The film takes a glimpse in their lives with a touch of wittiness and portrays the simple aspirations and dreams they have.Overall, the film feels pretty slow at the beginning lacking the shades in the story; but the film does become emotional in its second half with few sequences that appear humble, yet touvhing. Instead of a modern school, the film presents a backdrop of a government school and the way the students improve their studies appears a bit glib. It's hard to digest watching the students who are totally zero in their subjects improving their maths just discussing few simple problems with the topper in the break times. Their personal effort or teacher's effort is nowhere shown. The film definitely isn't the calibre of movies like ""Jagriti"" or ""Taare Zameen Par"" made on similar plots; but at instances, the film does its wonders through its touching story, heart warming moments, and spontaneous performances of Swara Bhaskar and Riya Shukla.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",low profile non star cast movie with nice message moments,neel battey sannata this unfamiliar inquisitive title means zero or worthless due low profile non star cast film it wont find much viewership which is sad part as this film deserves better reach film through its simply told story very strongly advocates importance education by end fills story with strong emotional bonding mother daughter film deals with characters who are very poor who making living out washing dishes film takes glimpse their lives with touch wittiness portrays simple aspirations dreams they have overall film feels pretty slow at beginning lacking shades story but film does become emotional its second half with few sequences that appear humble yet touvhing instead modern school film presents backdrop government school way students improve their studies appears bit glib its hard digest watching students who are totally zero their subjects improving their maths just discussing few simple problems with topper break times their personal effort or teachers effort is nowhere shown film definitely isnt calibre movies like jagriti or taare zameen par made similar plots but at instances film does its wonders through its touching story heart warming moments spontaneous performances swara bhaskar riya shukla rating 2 stars out 4,0.49285714285714294,0.01697916666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.38}"

On such scenario, many-a-times I'd feel if the parents motivates at home our work could be a lot easier .

8.0,"Dreams are aspirational, and everyone has the right to dream big and live it","What worked: The movie is a tribute to the foundation of our dreams to make it come true; the mother. It's a very well written, acted and directed piece of cinema. Ashwiny and Swara made one of the very heartwarming stories of our time, a tribute to the parents who dream about our dream. Pankaj and Ratna added the needed warmth and flavor to this beautiful movie. Usually the philosophies recited in movies stand flat but this movie had every reasons to mean and make all the philosophical meaningful and relevant , thus making a solid impact when the movie ended.

5.0,A fairy tale take on an important social issue,"In Bollywood, there is a term for movies that exaggerate emotions and situations to the point that the depictions of the characters, their dialogues, their actions etc. become detached from reality and enter the realm of fantasy. Such movies are called 'filmy'. In 'filmy' movies, viewers are asked to dispel their notions of rationality and realism and are expected to simply allow themselves to be taken into a fantastical journey by the writer/director. Any questioning of why a character would be so nice (or so evil) is impertinent since the viewer is expected to know that the movie is pure fantasy.This is one such 'filmy' movie. It is, as said by a reviewer below, a well-made and sweet movie. However, given the theme that it presents (the importance of education necessary for uplifting people from poverty), the approach taken by the director to mix fantasy with the grim reality (i.e. the hardships faced by poor parents for educating their children), the movie, it's characters and it's dialgoue felt not just out-of-place but shallow. For instance, in the real India - a maid (or a domestic servant) would never be able to afford to make chinese food at home. No 15 year old child would ever make a statement to his classmate: ""Your parents are not asserting their dreams on you by asking you to study. For you are their dream."" The entire movie is full of such cliched dialogue, set-ups and characters that made me feel that I was watching Cinderella (or some other fairy tale) when I should have been watching something as grim as The Game of Thrones. Thus, instead of being a hard-hitting realistic take on an important social issue, the movie is sugar coated fluff.So, yes this is a well-made and sweet movie. It may be even worth your 100 minutes. But in the end, it's a cute teddy bear with little relation to reality. As long as you keep these expectations, thumbs up. Else, two thumbs down.",fairy tale take important social issue,bollywood there is term movies that exaggerate emotions situations point that depictions characters their dialogues their actions etc become detached reality enter realm fantasy such movies are called filmy filmy movies viewers are asked dispel their notions rationality realism are expected simply allow themselves be taken into fantastical journey by writer director any questioning why character would be so nice or so evil is impertinent since viewer is expected know that movie is pure fantasy this is one such filmy movie it is as said by reviewer below well made sweet movie however given theme that it presents importance education necessary uplifting people poverty approach taken by director mix fantasy with grim reality i e hardships faced by poor parents educating their children movie its characters its dialgoue felt not just out place but shallow instance real india maid or domestic servant would never be able afford make chinese food at home no 15 year old child would ever make statement his classmate your parents are not asserting their dreams you by asking you study you are their dream entire movie is full such cliched dialogue set ups characters that made me feel that i was watching cinderella or some other fairy tale when i should have been watching something as grim as game thrones thus instead being hard hitting realistic take important social issue movie is sugar coated fluff so yes this is well made sweet movie it may be even worth your 100 minutes but end its cute teddy bear with little relation reality as long as you keep these expectations thumbs up else two thumbs down,0.5224152724152724,-0.020146932646932646,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.48}"
