3.0,"I was expecting something worse, but this is still really bad","I was really excited about this movie since the announcment, because the time and the events it presents are a really memorable part of my childhood. Honestly, I was expecting something worse, but this is still a boring, dumb, amateur and often illogical movie. The cinematography is weird, at the beginning it looks cool but slowly it become something really strange. The editing is also really lame, stuff just happen. There is part in the middle of movie where I thought that it will end, my friends had the same feeling aaand nope. When it actually ends it doesnt feel right, the story could go further but its suddenly over. The acting is weird too, it feels like they not even want to do this. This movie has the worst rain vfx ever. The whole thing is feel like watching a 2 hours long mix of csi miami, komissar rex and a b category american action movie from the 2000's.There was a few good moments i enjoyed, Zsolt Zayzon is a great actor but they just can't save this film.",i was expecting something worse but this is still really bad,i was really excited about this movie since announcment because time events it presents are really memorable part my childhood honestly i was expecting something worse but this is still boring dumb amateur often illogical movie cinematography is weird at beginning it looks cool but slowly it become something really strange editing is also really lame stuff just happen there is part middle movie where i thought that it will end my friends had same feeling aaand nope when it actually ends it doesnt feel right story could go further but its suddenly over acting is weird too it feels like they not even want do this this movie has worst rain vfx ever whole thing is feel like watching 2 hours long mix csi miami komissar rex b category american action movie 2000s there was few good moments i enjoyed zsolt zayzon is great actor but they just cant save this film,0.5170122887864823,-0.0585253456221198,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.2}"

1.0,A PPOLITICAL ROPAGANDA MOVIE!!!,"So sad, that millions of Euros were used from hungarian public funds to create such a motion picture filled with lies and inaccuracy about a hungarian historical event during 2006.It is also a shame that both the director and the director of photography are not hungarians which is to show that this is a political propaganda movie that is fiction. Hungarian filmmakers are very known in the movie industry with couple of Oscars to confirm it but this movie is so overrated trying to convince the hungarian audience that it is a non-fiction.I was there in Budapest during the 2006 political demonstrations and after watching the movie for free of course I had that terrible feeling about how the current hungarian political party in power is using all means necessary to brainwash hungarian people by creating propaganda movies.In Hungary at the moment the government is an autocratic regime trying to silence all opposition parties and using every tool to stay in power.

1.0,An objectively bad movie - but there's more!,"A movie can be carried by three things: a good plot, amazing visuals or interesting characters. This one had none of it, except for historically mostly accurate sets, which really stood out in this absolute waste of data.The plot itself is mostly based on a conspiracy theory, and the characters are either the most goody-two shoes boyscout characters, while the antagonists are only fueled by the power of pure evil. I'm not even kidding, Voldemort and the Emperor aren't even close. And what for? Well, prepare to die with that question, because even Darren Cross in Ant-Man seems to have fairly valid motivations in comparison.The cinematography is just... meh? It's got no personality whatsoever, and it just feels like it's shot with a generic template for an action movie (which is really dumb, because this is the most boring pile of crap I've ever seen).The pacing is also so off... Even living through the whole thing in real time seemed to have better flow than sitting through this movie.All in all, this kind of good vs. Evil story wouldn't hold up in 2021 even if the villains had reasonable motivations, because there are zero shades thrown around, it's pure black and white. Any spoiler warning is completely useless, because there is literally nothing to spoil in this plot.And don't get me started on the ""marketing"" of this movie.0/10, worse than Daredevil 2004, but at least that was sometimes funny.",objectively bad movie but theres more,movie can be carried by three things good plot amazing visuals or interesting characters this one had none it except historically mostly accurate sets which really stood out this absolute waste data plot itself is mostly based conspiracy theory characters are either most goody two shoes boyscout characters while antagonists are only fueled by power pure evil im not even kidding voldemort emperor arent even close what well prepare die with that question because even darren cross ant man seems have fairly valid motivations comparison cinematography is just meh its got no personality whatsoever it just feels like its shot with generic template action movie which is really dumb because this is most boring pile crap ive ever seen pacing is also so off even living through whole thing real time seemed have better flow than sitting through this movie all all this kind good vs evil story wouldnt hold up 2021 even if villains had reasonable motivations because there are zero shades thrown around its pure black white any spoiler warning is completely useless because there is literally nothing spoil this plot dont get me started marketing this movie 0 10 worse than daredevil 2004 but at least that was sometimes funny,0.5453703703703705,0.05658068783068786,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"
1.0,Disaster of Hungarian film industry,"Finally I could watch free (I didn't want to watch it in the cinema because I paid the price of the filming with my tax) this ""political drama"" after it was on show on the Hungarian TV channel TV2.If I had to describe it in one word: terrible. Don't watch it, it is a 2 hours long suffering. The sounds are unclassifiable, you can't hear the dialogues in the most scenes. The story is untraceable. The acting performance is below average, it seems they did it only for a lot of money.The purpose of the film isn't the entertainment. It has just one purpose: character murder of Klára Dobrev before the Hungarian election in April, 2022. Tiny beauty flaw that the prime minister nominee isn't Dobrev.So my rating is 1* becaust this isn't a real movie, this is just another one propaganda product of the Hungarian government from the tax-payers money. From that money which could be much more useful in the health care or in the education, where people earn less money than an operator in a factory.

1.0,Very weak try to mislead the old people (even more),"I have 2 basic remarks besides the ones already mentioned by everyone here:1. It was a huge missed opportunity to leave out the famous speech (Öszödi Beszéd) from Gyurcsány. The whole point of the 'movie' (cinematic propaganda) was to create a monster image for him, so why leave out the juiciest part?2. The target audience here is obviously the higher age group, so older people, who cannot think clearly anymore (close to dementia) and are easily brain'massaged'. However, when listing the facts at the end of the 'movie', they are only on for like 2-3 seconds. I am 100% sure that your audience of 89+ year old grandmas and grandpas were not able to read those lines! (Even I couldn't.)All in all, the title of this piece of 'art' speaks for it self.

1.0,Political propaganda piece releases just ahead of elections.,"The acting is terrible, the script is horrendous, the whole thing was made with russian money to prop up the fidesz regime for one more term so they can finally completely turn our country in to a dictatorship. Funny how this was shown for free in movie theaters and the turnout was way below expectations, so now they conveniently release it on state TV, which still spews verbatim russian propaganda, just a month before election. On the same state TV that will not give any time for opposition politicians, but will always gladly show orban roll around acting like he's doing good for the country, meanwhile he and his cronies managed to steal so much that the country is nearing economic collapse. They keep beating the drum about how we live better than ever before. I guess that's why they had to mandate a price-freeze on basic groceries. Inflation is getting to a point where people are having trouble affording groceries.I've never seen something more disgusting in my life, and I'm ashamed to be a hungarian.",political propaganda piece releases just ahead elections,acting is terrible script is horrendous whole thing was made with russian money prop up fidesz regime one more term so they can finally completely turn our country dictatorship funny how this was shown free movie theaters turnout was way below expectations so now they conveniently release it state tv which still spews verbatim russian propaganda just month before election same state tv that will not give any time opposition politicians but will always gladly show orban roll around acting like hes doing good country meanwhile he his cronies managed steal so much that country is nearing economic collapse they keep beating drum about how we live better than ever before i guess thats why they had mandate price freeze basic groceries inflation is getting point where people are having trouble affording groceries ive never seen something more disgusting my life im ashamed be hungarian,0.3895833333333334,0.07443181818181815,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"

1.0,I went into this movie understanding nothing and came out understanding even less,"I finished watching this movie 20 minutes ago with my family. It was the first time it was broadcast on cable, and since the network it aired on is generally in favour of our current government, I don't doubt that the rating of this movie will get a boost in the coming days.I am, of course, running under the assumption that no one is watching this movie with any sort of a critical eye, because objectively, no matter where you lie on the political spectrum, this movie is among the most bafflingly awful I've seen in quite some time.The story has absolutely zero through-line to speak of in the first half. A majority of our time was spent figuring out who each character even is and how they are relevant to the story. The shots seem to randomly switch from a pub to a boardroom to the main character's home with no rhyme or reason. No character is given a proper introduction; without prior knowledge, you wouldn't have been able to tell that the wife of the Prime Minister, who is supposed to be the main antagonist (I think...?), is in fact the wife of the Prime Minister. I had to point that out to one of my fellow viewers. Her appearance didn't help matters, it does not resemble Klára Dobrev in the slightest.So we have characters we can't identify, in a story where we struggle to identify the main storyline until it emerges about an hour in. And even that storyline's resolution is contrived as all hell.The main character's boyfriend just flat-out disappears in the middle of the movie, with material about the wrongdoings of the government which he wishes to leak to German news outlets, then at the end reappears as a deus ex machina, and reveals he has been bribed as a last-ditch effort to make sure the MC doesn't have a chance to reveal her findings to the public. How he was bribed and was caught is never given a thought.Actually, lots of things are not given even the most miniscule of thoughts.The main character manages to hide in the men's bathroom stall in the Parliament after placing a dictaphone in one of the boardrooms, and stays in the stall until dark without anyone needing to use the single stall with a toilet, because reasons.After getting out, and collecting the dictaphone, the wife of the Prime Minister, who realistically has no reason to still be there, just happens to open the boardroom door one last time at night when the main character is coincidentally still there, because reasons.The only thing that makes even remote sense during this movie's events is a 15-20 minute monologue (at least it sure felt that long), given to the main character by her boss, in which he explains, using an analogy a child could understand, how the government at the time got into power. This monologue takes the principal rule of moviemaking, ""Show, don't tell"", and throws it into a trash compactor and then into an incinerator.And it's painful, because honestly, the scheme described during this monologue, and the House of Cards-esque manner in which the Prime Minister reformed the governing party and narrowly won the election, would have made for a story that's orders of magnitude more interesting, full of potential intrigue and more capable of serving this film's blatant goal of being propaganda for the current Hungarian government.And instead of that story, which the scriptwriters and director were clearly aware of, we get this mishmash of random scenes and dialogue which fails to coalesce into anything comprehensible until the halfway point, at which point it decides to hammer you over with its message with a police-grade rubber baton.This movie is worthless to anyone voting for any given party, because nothing said here is anyting they haven't heard of already.It's worthless to those on the fence because it fails to make convincing arguments.It's worthless to anyone who's not Hungarian because it's bad at explaining the political history of the country, save for the monologue I mentioned above which no sane person would listen to the whole way through without yawning.And more importantly, it's worthless to anyone with even a remote interest in watching good movies, because it's an absolutely awful movie.Avoid like the plague.",i went into this movie understanding nothing came out understanding even less,i finished watching this movie 20

I am: pretty well informed about the world politics, world economy, history, constantly watching economy stuffs on YouTube, statistics, thinking about internal and external politics/economy, certified iq 139, trying to be as objective as possible with references. I write this for you to understand, who write this review. The movie: Is it bad? Definitely no! Is it good? Hey, I saw worse movies in this week. Is it propaganda movie? Well if House of cards and other Hollywood political drama movies are, then yes. But I don't think so. Is it documentary? It based on true events, but this is a crime-drama, not documentary. Things happened, but this is still a movie. Is two hours are long? For me, it wasn't. There are new things, twists constantly. It can build the empathy, and you get excited about the characters. -What I liked in this film? The actress is beautiful, acting is upper mediocre, the screen is good, I liked the music, Budapest is beautiful, character development is great. Who would I recommend: If you want to watch a movie about a riot, with some crime detective story, with some political tricks, if you liked House of Cards, if you can watch a movie as a movie, without hateful to the government or the opposite (so you can watch a movie as an adult or you are foreigner) I definitely recommend. My rate is 6.5 because I enjoyed it as a movie, I have attachment to Budapest, the actress is beautiful, the display is good(and you know what an imdb 6.5 movie is). I will watch it again, because there are a lot of details what I couldn't focus, probably.P. S.: Please rate the movie itself after you watched it. Please ignore the whole Hungarian media about it. This is a good movie in Hungarian level, and it makes me sad, that critics make reviews based on the actual political fighting and not about the movie. This is worth to watch.",objective review critic about movie,i wanted write review about this movie because there are lot misinformation fake critics fake promotions i just watched it i am pretty well informed about world politics world economy history constantly watching economy stuffs youtube statistics thinking about internal external politics economy certified iq 139 trying be as objective as possible with references i write this you understand who write this review movie is it bad definitely no is it good hey i saw worse movies this week is it propaganda movie well if house cards other hollywood political drama movies are then yes but i dont think so is it documentary it based true events but this is crime drama not documentary things happened but this is still movie is two hours are long me it wasnt there are new things twists constantly it can build empathy you get excited about characters what i liked this film actress is beautiful acting is upper mediocre screen is good i liked music budapest is beautiful character development is great who would i recommend if you want watch movie about riot with some crime detective story with some political tricks if you liked house cards if you can watch movie as movie without hateful government or opposite so you can watch movie as adult or you are foreigner i definitely recommend my rate is 6 5 because i enjoyed it as movie i have attachment budapest actress is beautiful display is good you know what imdb 6 5 movie is i will watch it again because there are lot details what i couldnt focus probably p s please rate movie itself after you watched it please ignore whole hungarian media about it this is good movie hungarian level it makes me sad that critics make reviews based actual political fighting not about movie this is worth watch,0.48695286195286214,0.1274747474747475,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,"This is not entertainment, this is history",This is a great movie for those who truly want to understand why Hungarian politics are as is nowadays. It was heartbreaking to watch it as most of the events were really happening in the streets of Budapest in 2006. The leader of current opposition parties in Hungary are exactly this dark and manipulative even nowadays. It is a must watch for young people and foreigners in order to never support politicians like gyurcsany.,this is not entertainment this is history,this is great movie those who truly want understand why hungarian politics are as is nowadays it was heartbreaking watch it as most events were really happening streets budapest 2006 leader current opposition parties hungary are exactly this dark manipulative even nowadays it is must watch young people foreigners order never support politicians like gyurcsany,0.41428571428571426,0.24285714285714288,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.25}"
