9.0,I did not expect that!!!,"It's fair to say I haven't always been the biggest fan of Nicholas Cage, but it's not the talent, it's often the film choices, similar to Michael Cain, he really has made some shockers. What this film does however is poke a little fun at his past, it's tongue in cheek, but it's a cracking movie.It's funny, it's energetic, it zips along, there isn't a single dull moment here, you don't need to be a fan or a critic, this movie is just really worth your time.Loaded with irony, it's plain to see that Cage has a sense of humour, this really is a winner for him.It wasn't what I was expected, but I am so glad I went to see it, I'd really recommend it. 9/10.",i did not expect that,its fair say i havent always been biggest fan nicholas cage but its not talent its often film choices similar michael cain he really has made some shockers what this film does however is poke little fun at his past its tongue cheek but its cracking movie its funny its energetic it zips along there isnt single dull moment here you dont need be fan or critic this movie is just really worth your time loaded with irony its plain see that cage has sense humour this really is winner him it wasnt what i was expected but i am so glad i went see it id really recommend it 9 10,0.43258928571428573,0.12719494047619048,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.2}"

7.0,What a cool idea with the perfect actor,"To give you insight into my relationship with Nicolas Cage, I will quote the end of my review for his movie Jiu Jitsu, which I gave 1 star:""This is just a straight-garbage movie. Damn you Nick Cage!... I wonder what movie of his I'll watch next.""I've been a fan of his for so long. I think he's very talented and has a certain crazy appeal that you don't see from other actors. And I keep watching most of his movies even as they plummet in quality and rarely make it to cinemas. He still makes them entertaining, even if they are awful. This is a huge contrast to other former A-list actors who have gone down the same path but with unwatchable movies. Like fellow Face/Off star John Travolta or Bruce Willis (we will miss you!).So when they decide to make a movie that's essentially all about Nick Cage, of course I'm 100% in. And I have to say, this is his best movie in years. It's levels above the quality of his recent direct-to-video movies and is definitely cinema-worthy.I laughed a lot. A couple parts had me crying from laughter. And when I wasn't laughing I was generally amused. It felt so refreshing to laugh with his movie rather than at it. And with the lack of comedy movies lately, this came at a perfect time.Other than the comedy, this is a mostly well-made movie with a story and characters that kept me invested. I love the meta aspect. Nick Cage's performance in this role is perfect. It has a good supporting cast with the standout being Pedro Pascal. He's so likeable and has great chemistry with Nick Cage. Their relationship drives the movie. Pedro Pascal is a star.I had a great time with this movie. I think most will enjoy it, but the ones who will appreciate it the most are the fans who are familiar with his work.

,A delightful comedy about a famous actor playing himself and filmmaking,"Nick Cage: ""Is that supposed to be me? It's ... grotesque.""The unbelievable part of The Unbelievable Weight of Immense Talent is that it's all true (in a figurative way). Nicolas Cage can play himself, Nick Cage, because the many films he's been in, some worthwhile (Moonstruck, Raising Arizona, Face/Off) and some terrible (take your pick), have prepared him for a true meta experience, like John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich or the cast playing themselves in Robert Altman's The Player.Of course, it's hilarious because Cage is usually a witty version of himself and making fun of himself anyway (except when he wins the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas). With the help of director Tom Gormican and writer Kevin Etten, Unbearable is a metanarrative of Nick as a burgeoning hero for his daughter, Addy (Lily Sheen), and a buddy for a drug kingpin, Avi (Pedro Pascal), with whom he writes a joke thriller, which Unbearable turns out to be.Pascal's performance as a thorough Cage fan and possible drug lord emphasizes the often-close emotional bond between fans, star, and film. There is little difference between us and Avi in our love for the actor and his roles.Throughout this comedy, the art of filmmaking turns out to take center screen as the principals dog out a workable script that they really are starring in here, more or less because the fusion of art and life is blurred. The varied facets of filmmaking and the actor's relationship with his audience are never far from the surface. Nor is it stagnant because each Cage film is a mirror for Hollywood's immediate needs and its actor's. In Unbearable Nick's striving for the ""part of a lifetime,"" never far from a clich√©.For Nicolas Cage, such is his life, and the film makes fun of his accepting roles solely for getting cash to pay his bills, and maybe, just maybe, for the joy of acting, for which he's indicted when he loses the people closest to him because of his obsession for acting.As Cage plays himself, he stumbles on the right script to reconcile him with his family and win the admiration of his audience. He's never far from his Oscar in Leaving Las Vegas or a ""should-have-been-nominated"" in Pig. A good will pervades this complex comedy, largely because Cage has a good heart hidden underneath his thespian ambitions, real or fictional.",delightful comedy about famous actor playing himself filmmaking,nick cage is that supposed be me its grotesque unbelievable part unbelievable weight immense talent is that its all true figurative way nicolas cage can play himself nick cage because many films hes been some worthwhile moonstruck raising arizona face off some terrible take your pick have prepared him true meta experience like john malkovich being john malkovich or cast playing themselves robert altmans player course its hilarious because cage is usually witty version himself making fun himself anyway except when he wins oscar leaving las vegas with help director tom gormican writer kevin etten unbearable is metanarrative nick as burgeoning hero his daughter addy lily sheen buddy drug kingpin avi pedro pascal with whom he writes joke thriller which unbearable turns out be pascals performance as thorough cage fan possible drug lord emphasizes often close emotional bond between fans star film there is little difference between us avi our love actor his roles throughout this comedy art filmmaking turns out take center screen as principals dog out workable script that they really are starring here more or less because fusion art life is blurred varied facets filmmaking actors relationship with his audience are never far surface nor is it stagnant because each cage film is mirror hollywoods immediate needs its actors unbearable nicks striving part lifetime never far clich nicolas cage such is his life film makes fun his accepting roles solely getting cash pay his bills maybe just maybe joy acting which hes indicted when he loses people closest him because his obsession acting as cage plays himself he stumbles right script reconcile him with his family win admiration his audience hes never far his oscar leaving las vegas or should have been nominated pig good will pervades this complex comedy largely because cage has good heart hidden underneath his thespian ambitions real or fictional,0.5747321428571427,0.15947916666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,Nicolas and Nic and Nick and Nicky,"Greetings again from the darkness. Calling all Nicolas Cage fans! Put the bunny back in the box and get ready for the most fun you'll ever have with Nicolas or Nic or Nick or Nicky. And if one Cage isn't enough for you, you're in luck. This film has Nicolas Cage playing the (somewhat) fictional Nick Cage, and Nicolas Kim Coppola (Nicolas Cage's birth name) playing imaginary alter-ego Nicky, a younger version of Nicolas Cage from the WILD AT HEART era who spends the movie constantly reminding Nick that he's a movie star.If you can't make much sense out of all that, don't worry, writer-director Tom Gormican and co-writer Kevin Etten have created a film that is sure to strike a chord with Nicolas Cage fans. What we see is a parody going meta in a surreal way. Very few get to star in the tribute to their own legend, but that's what happens here. Nicolas Cage goes 'inside baseball' on the career of Nicolas Cage ... only he does so as struggling actor Nick Cage, an actor so desperate for ""the role of a lifetime"" that he improvs a reading for director David Gordon Green (Cage's director on JOE) in the parking lot of Chateau Marmont.Having been kicked out of his rental after falling behind $600,000 in rent, Nick agrees to take a humiliating job pitched by his agent, Fink (Neil Patrick Harris). For one million dollars, he is to fly to Mallorca and hang out at the birthday party of rich super fan, Javi Gutierrez (a terrific Pedro Pascall, ""The Mandalorian""). The twist here is that CIA agents played by Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz suspect Javi of being a notorious gun dealer who has kidnapped the young daughter of the Catalonia President. Spy-type shenanigans ensue as Nick and Javi develop a bromance that finds the two new buddies writing a film script together. And if that's not quite enough subplots, you should know that Nick is at a breaking point in his relationship with his ex-wife Olivia (Sharon Horgan) and teenage daughter Abby (Lily Sheen, real life daughter of Michael Sheen and Kate Beckinsale).The zaniness includes nods to more than a dozen Nicolas Cage movies, and much of the fun is derived from recognizing these. Easter eggs are everywhere for fans, and Nic expertly plays Nick (and Nicky) as a loving tribute to the characters we've seen in so many iconic films over the years. Additionally, on screen love is provided for the 1920 classic, THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, as well as the more recent gem, PADDINGTON 2 (2017), making this a tribute to cinema lovers, Nicolas Cage fans, and comedies in general. I will admit to disliking director Gormican's 2014 movie, THAT AWKWARD MOMENT, so much that I hoped he was done as a filmmaker. It turns out, he's back (and much improved) ... not that he ever went anywhere.Opens in theaters on April 22, 2022.",nicolas nic nick nicky,greetings again darkness calling all nicolas cage fans put bunny back box get ready most fun youll ever have with nicolas or nic or nick or nicky if one cage isnt enough you youre luck this film has nicolas cage playing somewhat fictional nick cage nicolas kim coppola nicolas cages birth name playing imaginary alter ego nicky younger version nicolas cage wild at heart era who spends movie constantly reminding nick that hes movie star if you cant make much sense out all that dont worry writer director tom gormican co writer kevin etten have created film that is sure strike chord with nicolas cage fans what we see is parody going meta surreal way very few get star tribute their own legend but thats what happens here nicolas cage goes inside baseball career nicolas cage only he does so as struggling actor nick cage actor so desperate role lifetime that he improvs reading director david gordon green cages director joe parking lot chateau marmont having been kicked out his rental after falling behind 600 000 rent nick agrees take humiliating job pitched by his agent fink neil patrick harris one million dollars he is fly mallorca hang out at birthday party rich super fan javi gutierrez terrific pedro pascall mandalorian twist here is that cia agents played by tiffany haddish ike barinholtz suspect javi being notorious gun dealer who has kidnapped young daughter catalonia president spy type shenanigans ensue as nick javi develop bromance that finds two new buddies writing film script together if thats not quite enough subplots you should know that nick is at breaking point his relationship with his ex wife olivia sharon horgan teenage daughter abby lily sheen real life daughter michael sheen kate beckinsale zaniness includes nods more than dozen nicolas cage movies much fun is derived recognizing these easter eggs are everywhere fans nic expertly plays nick nicky as loving tribute characters weve seen so many iconic films over years additionally screen love is provided 1920 classic cabinet dr caligari as well as more recent gem paddington 2 2017 making this tribute cinema lovers nicolas cage fans comedies general i will admit disliking director gormicans 2014 movie that awkward moment so much that i hoped he was done as filmmaker it turns out hes back much improved not that he ever went anywhere opens theaters april 22 2022,0.4863439270756344,0.15978935698447894,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"

6.0,A mixed bag,"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a standard action comedy elevated by meta aspects. Particularly, Nicolas Cage as himself is a great gimmick since he's embraced his meme status. Still, Massive Talent is a missed opportunity because it's otherwise generic. The self-awareness is fun, the self-deprecation works, the Cage/Pascal chemistry is endearing, and the ending is heartfelt. However, the plot is lacking. Massive Talent admits that talky comedy and shoehorned action are lowbrow, yet plays into those tropes. The climax especially devolves into forgettable modern formulas. Therefore, Massive Talent combines wit with mediocrity, making it a mixed bag.Meanwhile, Massive Talent's technicals are minor. There's fitting music, believable production, and blending sound transitions. The editing is noticeable because it serves punchlines and maintains a tight runtime. However, the cinematography isn't proactive, the effects are sparse (besides a young Nick alter ego), and the direction is basic. The tone takes itself just seriously enough, but the presentation of this material is bland. Ultimately, Nicolas Cage's commitment, Pascal's innocence, and the vulnerable family drama drive Massive Talent, but only so far. It's a fun movie that Cage fans should enjoy, but don't expect much else.Writing: 6/10 Direction: 5/10 Cinematography: 5/10 Acting: 7/10 Editing: 6/10 Sound: 6/10 Score/Soundtrack: 6/10 Production Design: 6/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 7/10Overall Score: 6.2/10.",mixed bag,unbearable weight massive talent is standard action comedy elevated by meta aspects particularly nicolas cage as himself is great gimmick since hes embraced his meme status still massive talent is missed opportunity because its otherwise generic self awareness is fun self deprecation works cage pascal chemistry is endearing ending is heartfelt however plot is lacking massive talent admits that talky comedy shoehorned action are lowbrow yet plays into those tropes climax especially devolves into forgettable modern formulas therefore massive talent combines wit with mediocrity making it mixed bag meanwhile massive talents technicals are minor theres fitting music believable production blending sound transitions editing is noticeable because it serves punchlines maintains tight runtime however cinematography isnt proactive effects are sparse besides young nick alter ego direction is basic tone takes itself just seriously enough but presentation this material is bland ultimately nicolas cages commitment pascals innocence vulnerable family drama drive massive talent but only so far its fun movie that cage fans should enjoy but dont expect much else writing 6 10 direction 5 10 cinematography 5 10 acting 7 10 editing 6 10 sound 6 10 score soundtrack 6 10 production design 6 10 casting 8 10 effects 7 10overall score 6 2 10,0.5135225885225885,0.08901098901098903,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
6.0,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,"""It's grotesque, I'll give you $20,000 for it"". That's such a Nic Cage moment in a movie about Nic Cage starring um, Nicolas Cage. Oh and there's a couple of scenes where Cage sees his Wild at Heart persona as a sort of kooky hallucination. Oh man, that hair.Anyway, Nicolas Cage appears in 2022's The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, a rather dry action/comedy in which Cage plays himself (apparently in the same exact way he plays all his other characters). Cage's performance is good because well, it's no stretch. There's the overacting, the crescendo yells, and the massive craziness. This ""cage"" as usual, has been opened up and let loose.Self-parodies and self-deprecation-s begot, ""Talent"" gives the audience those cultural references that any Nic Cage fan could salivate over (like myself). There's that famous line, ""why couldn't you put the bunny back in the box?"" (from Con Air of course). Then there's that ""not the bees!"" quip from The Wicker Man. Finally, there's a clip from Guarding Tess that Nic watches solemnly from a TV set in a hotel room. You think taking in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent would be the ultimate Nic Cage experience but it doesn't quite reach that plateau. It's almost underwhelming espy if you put it next to his best flicks (Con Air mentioned earlier, The Cotton Club, Face/Off, Leaving Las Vegas).Like I said in the second paragraph, ""Talent"" is billed as an action/comedy. Well there's not a whole lot of laughs and the action scenes aren't really that bracing (you'd think with the R rating there'd be a little more something something). If anything, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a gimmickry vehicle in the Cage canon, a possible out of the box attempt to jump-start Nicky boy's iffy career (he's made some questionable stuff in the last couple of decades). Would I recommend ""Talent?"" Probably not. Hey at least it wasn't ""unbearable"" after one showing.",views film review unbearable weight massive talent,its grotesque ill give you 20 000 it thats such nic cage moment movie about nic cage starring um nicolas cage oh theres couple scenes where cage sees his wild at heart persona as sort kooky hallucination oh man that hair anyway nicolas cage appears 2022s unbearable weight massive talent rather dry action comedy which cage plays himself apparently same exact way he plays all his other characters cages performance is good because well its no stretch theres overacting crescendo yells massive craziness this cage as usual has been opened up let loose self parodies self deprecation s begot talent gives audience those cultural references that any nic cage fan could salivate over like myself theres that famous line why couldnt you put bunny back box con air course then theres that not bees quip wicker man finally theres clip guarding tess that nic watches solemnly tv set hotel room you think taking unbearable weight massive talent would be ultimate nic cage experience but it doesnt quite reach that plateau its almost underwhelming espy if you put it next his best flicks con air mentioned earlier cotton club face off leaving las vegas like i said second paragraph talent is billed as action comedy well theres not whole lot laughs action scenes arent really that bracing youd think with r rating thered be little more something something if anything unbearable weight massive talent is gimmickry vehicle cage canon possible out box attempt jump start nicky boys iffy career hes made some questionable stuff last couple decades would i recommend talent probably not hey at least it wasnt unbearable after one showing,0.5176638176638176,0.027608618233618234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.47}"

8.0,Pure Genius,"When Nick Cage (Nicholas Cage) realizes his finances are disastrous, he agrees to make a one-time appearance at a billionaire's birthday. Once he gets off the plane and meets billionaire Javi (Pedro Pascal), a friendship is struck up. Before Nick can get too comfortable, he finds out that his new billionaire friend is being watched by the CIA, who quickly recruits him to be their new informant.If this film had been made with and about anyone other than Nicolas Cage, I don't think it would have worked. This film was written to highlight some of Cage's best moments in his career, leaving the viewer with Easter eggs galore. The direction of the film taps into the action genre while still being a true comedy. Just when you think it's just a comedy, it switches gears into a crime drama. The cinematography brings you to the gorgeous paradise of the film's setting.As previously stated, Nicolas Cage is fantastic and shows why he's had such a long career. Buddying up with Pedro Pascal is a match made in heaven. These two play off of each other so well. Tiffany Haddish delivers some memorable lines and commands the scene when she's in it. Ike Barinholtz has impeccable comedic timing as always, and the biggest downfall is not having more of him and Haddish. Sharon Horgan and Lily Mo Sheen round out Cage's family, and the dynamic feels pure. You get a true sense of a dysfunctional family that truly loves each other. And last but not least, is Neil Patrick Harris, who plays Cage's agent with gusto.It is hard to find fault with this film. I'm not sure if it's because it is so much fun or because the runtime just flies by. So elements such as the score and other technical areas don't shine too brightly, but I'm not sure they were intended to. Some characters could have used a bit more screen time, but keeping their appearances to a minimum made their moments a little more memorable. Going up a notch in some of the action set pieces would have been the icing on the cake, but now I'm just getting greedy.The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a film that is going to be talked about for years.

9.0,Big energy from Nick Cage!,"My score: 9.2/10 IMDb: 8.0/10 (2,275 users) Metascore: 72/100 (20 critics)If you are Nick Cage fan then I truly believe you will love this film. The comedy is so fluid, that it had me laughing so hard throughout, my face and stomach started to hurt.The acting was on point. Not just from Cage, but also from Pedro Pascal. I found them to be a hilarious duo that blended, and fed off each other, quite well.I truly enjoy Nicolas Cage as an actor, but I haven't watched nearly enough films to understand the references that are throughout this film. However, I feel the goal was achieved in the reference department because other audience members seemed to enjoy the parts I didn't fully understand.The story was quite enjoyable, as well. The real world and acting world, so to speak, blended in such a way that the bits that were becoming a movie were enhancing the bits that are the movie. (Worded super weirdly there, but there's two plots sort of running and both are enjoyable simultaneously)While it doesn't feel like it outright all the time. The characters are definitely relatable and had me feeling empathy for them too.Overall, I absolutely loved this movie and was happy to laugh really hard in a natural way. If you hate Nicholas Cage as an actor then probably stay away, but if you love him I highly recommend checking this one out.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on the film. Until next time....

10.0,Most unironicly funny movie I've ever seen.,"Nicoles cage at his best ,and he has finally accepted the fact that he is a meme and this movie no exception. It has many nods to his past works and I love what they have down with this the movie, it truly is something beyond words. The comedy is spot on and is the funniest film I've seen in memory and the comedic timing really puts it at the best of all time. This movie deserves the credit it gets and I hope others can see it for the way it is ,rather than a fad of the time. An if this was the ultimate send of for Nicoles cage this is the perfect movie for any actor to make and I wish others would do the same. It really makes you respect the actor more than you did before even if his movies can be cheesey and poorly performed,but this is something else it is a showcase of his strong point as an actor. An I think as an actor nicoles is very misunderstood for his actual good performances, because in the end of the day he is a good actor it's just the reputation he has. So if you are reading this I hope you can understand the points I have brought up and truly enjoy this movie.",most unironicly funny movie ive ever seen,nicoles cage at his best he has finally accepted fact that he is meme this movie no exception it has many nods his past works i love what they have down with this movie it truly is something beyond words comedy is spot is funniest film ive seen memory comedic timing really puts it at best all time this movie deserves credit it gets i hope others can see it way it is rather than fad time if this was ultimate send nicoles cage this is perfect movie any actor make i wish others would do same it really makes you respect actor more than you did before even if his movies can be cheesey poorly performed but this is something else it is showcase his strong point as actor i think as actor nicoles is very misunderstood his actual good performances because end day he is good actor its just reputation he has so if you are reading this i hope you can understand points i have brought up truly enjoy this movie,0.5089646464646465,0.33080808080808083,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.3}"
6.0,Great? Not really. Decent? Sure.,"Nicolas Cage plays Nicolas Cage in an action-comedy-thriller about an actor who's paid $1 million to hang out with a suspected drug lord/huge Nic Cage fan (played by Pedro Pascal), and the complications that arise when the CIA simultaneously recruit Cage to spy on him.Does it sound too good to be true? Sort of. I was very excited to see this and hate to admit it, but found it to be a slight letdown.There were definitely positives though. Cage and Pascal are great, and without their committed performances, I don't know if the movie would have much else by way of entertainment value. Things shine when they're on screen together, and I loved their chemistry. Their dynamic made for many of the film's funniest moments, mainly in the first hour. It's in that first half to first two-thirds where the creative premise is a fair bit of fun, and decently executed.Problems come up in the final act. Without too many spoilers, they try to acknowledge the direction it takes with some meta humour, but the meta humour is pretty lazy (meta comedy has advanced to the point where merely being meta isn't enough). Also, the focus on action in that last act wouldn't be a problem if the action was good, but it's weirdly flat and toothless. It doesn't have much bite or excitement or fun to it at all.Still, at least there's some good comedic moments at a few points, and Cage + Pascal make it watchable. I wish it had been a little more consistent and been more engaging when it came to the action/thriller elements though.Even if it's not as wild or fun as it could've been, it's still likely to be a pretty decent time for fans of Nic Cage.",great not really decent sure,nicolas cage plays nicolas cage action comedy thriller about actor whos paid 1 million hang out with suspected drug lord huge nic cage fan played by pedro pascal complications that arise when cia simultaneously recruit cage spy him does it sound too good be true sort i was very excited see this hate admit it but found it be slight letdown there were definitely positives though cage pascal are great without their committed performances i dont know if movie would have much else by way entertainment value things shine when theyre screen together i loved their chemistry their dynamic made many films funniest moments mainly first hour its that first half first two thirds where creative premise is fair bit fun decently executed problems come up final act without too many spoilers they try acknowledge direction it takes with some meta humour but meta humour is pretty lazy meta comedy has advanced point where merely being meta isnt enough also focus action that last act wouldnt be problem if action was good but its weirdly flat toothless it doesnt have much bite or excitement or fun it at all still at least theres some good comedic moments at few points cage pascal make it watchable i wish it had been little more consistent been more engaging when it came action thriller elements though even if its not as wild or fun as it couldve been its still likely be pretty decent time fans nic cage,0.5142557651991615,0.21682389937106916,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,The Cage comeback enters into whole new meta-levels,"At more than one stage appearing destined for a sad demise in the lands of direct to video releases that ranged from the tolerable to the diabolical, the recent career revival and public adoration towards Oscar winner and walking meme Nicolas Cage has been a sight to behold and easily one of feel good stories of modern Hollywood history.It's hard to nail down an exact time and place where Cage reminded us all that he is in fact some form of national treasure but with the likes of recent releases such as Mandy, Joe, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and last years wonderful surprise Pig, Cage has started to deliver products that are not only on par with his early to mid-90's output but arguably career best with new meta-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent taking Cage's new found place in the adoring world to all new levels of goodness.Teaming up with sophomore feature director Tom Gormican to bring his real-life persona into a wild mix of his Hollywood self, Cage is here playing himself in a wild adventure that see's the committed performer a guest at Pedro Pascal's Javi Gutierrez's Spanish villa as the long-time Cage fanboy invites him to his home in an event that quickly turns dangerous as Cage is called upon help the US government stop a group of deadly arms dealers.Narratively there's nothing to get overly excited about here but the glue that holds this romp all together is the fact Gormican brings out the absolute best of Cage that is sure to be a treat to anyone that has watched his career blossom from bit parts in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, to Oscar glory in Leaving Las Vegas then sad appearances in the likes of The Wicker Man or Left Behind, with Cage here having the time of his life reflecting on his up and down career, riffing of his imaginary younger self and creating comedic gold chemistry with his co-star who proves his just as at home in a film such as this as he is in Mexican cartels and battling evil in a galaxy far far away.Rarely stopping for a moments pause, once Cage arrives as Javi's picturesque villa and strikes up a budding friendship with the film loving screenwriting fan, Weight just goes for broke as it throws Cage in a series of over the top and crazy situations with highlights coming thick and fast in the form of cliff jumps and acid trips and while it does start to lose steam once Cage's ex-wife and daughter arrive on the scene around the three quarters mark, there's a lot of good will built up from the film that ensures its never far from providing a fun time for all who signed up for the adventure to Cage's world that we are just living in.A film that for all intents and purposes should never have existed if we were to rewind mere years ago, Weight is a memorable addition to the totally unique and once in a lifetime career of one of Hollywood's most engaging icons, Weight has no right being as entertaining as it is as it gives us an insight into the world of Nic Cage, the man, the myth and the legend.Final Say -Likely to be a new favourite for any of Nic Cage's long-term fans or new bandwagoners, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a hugely entertaining film that doesn't unleash anything spectacular but does a fine job of allowing its leading men to have an absolute blast in a meta-comedy that will be one of 2022's most genuinely surprising outings.3 1/2 Donnie Brasco situations out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",cage comeback
