10.0,Breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur...,"Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by ""The Godfather, Part II"" in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters...",breathtaking its scope tragic grandeur,coppolas masterpiece is rivaled only by godfather part ii which 1940s setting first movie is extended backwards forwards reveal corrupting effect power film breathtaking its scope tragic grandeur shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods early career young vito corleone seen first around turn 20th century sicily then 1917 building his criminal underworld italian ghettos new york city post world war i plus that his son michael al pacino desperately trying keep his family together al pacinos performance is quiet solemn he is cold ruthless with whole contrast idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at beginning first film here hes calculating frightening force seeking expand casinos into pre revolutionary cuba consolidating empire surrounded by perfidy treason maintaining total confidence his ability control situation whether testifying before enraging senators or trying outface his worst enemies films haunting final shot lonely isolated paranoid michael his empty compound is unforgettable movie scene tragic portrait lonely fully damned person emotionally empty finished far waspish wife more distant faithful lawyer de niros rise orphan child by family feud back italy hood new york his position as respected don provides welcome break pacinos relentless attitude since people he kills seem deserve it vito comes off better than michael does it was wise coppola shuffle two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks disturbance continuity entire cast contributes greatly success film lee strasberg fascinating mixture lust ruthlessness g d spradlin absolutely right as sinister corrupt nevada senator michael v gazzo unforgettable as troubled gray haired informer gastone moschin excellent as blackmailer white suit john cazale marvelously timid as vague confused hesitant fredo diane keaton clearly irrational as long suffering wife kay talia shire too extravagant as lousy mother troy donahue too ambitious as fortune hunting suitor robert duvall excels as confidant retainer all powerful corleone family coppolas motion picture is not just mere supply with new characters events original its far more complex intimate movie than its predecessor it is not really sequel its just more it cleverly shifts time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence criminal mentality gangsters,0.6151737531874517,0.04490600723477435,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"

This movie is both ""prequel"" and ""sequel"" of the first godfather movie. I have never watched anything like this in my entire life.

10.0,The Greatest Film Ever Made,"The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery. Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (""Keep your friends close ....."", ""I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies""), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent.",greatest film ever made,original godfather is brilliant work it is sense voyeuristic delight allowing us see mafia inside we become part family it single handedly change worlds view organized crime created cast sympathetic characters none whom have shred common morality it was highest grossing movie its time brando created cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did 1972 as extraordinary achievement as this is part ii is even better it easily receives my nod as best picture ever made i have seen it at least 20 times each time its 200 minutes fly by movie uses flashbacks brilliantly weave two tales main story is reign michael corleone as worlds most powerful criminal now reaping benefits legalized gambling las vegas michael is evident billionaire with iron fist world treachery behind this director francis ford coppola spins tale rise michaels father vito center new york mafia it is these scenes that make film work art without spoiling i will simply say robert deniro as young vito is best acting performance all time role which he won richly deserved oscar screenplay is full delicious little underworld nuggets keep your friends close i dont want kill everyone just my enemies while it blows dense twisted plot past you at dizzying merciless pace cinematography is depressing atmospheric score continues eerie role its predecessor foretelling death evil all this makes movie great infinitely watchable but its whats deeper inside this film what it is really about that is its true genius godfather part ii is not really movie about mafia it is movie about mans life long struggle michael controls vast empire that is constantly slipping out his hands he grows increasingly distrustful paranoid even shows signs that he hates his own life michael almost seems resent fact that he is natural born crime lord man who puts family business ahead everything great don michael corleone can never come terms with one simple fact his fathers empire was built love respect michaels empire is built fear violent treachery see this movie its three half hours very well spent,0.5759219175885844,0.1551376863876864,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,The Greatest Sequel During the Cinema's History,"""The Godfather, Part II"" is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5.",greatest sequel during cinemas history,godfather part ii is excellent just like its predecessor while first is arguably greatest film ever made second installment is easily best sequel produced hands down film is split between stories michael corleone al pacino oscar nominated young vito corleone robert de niro his star making first oscar winning performance 1950s michael is trying expand his crime empire locales such as las vegas hollywood even turbulent cuba however there are numerous problems as older brother fredo john cazale may have double crossed family also two prominent crime bosses pose considerable threat as well lee strasberg michael v gazzo both oscar nominated younger sister connie oscar nominee talia shire is still reeling her husbands murder her fathers death at conclusion original film michael is also distancing himself his wife diane keaton some his most trusted friends robert duvall while all this is occurring we get glimpses into early life michaels father de niro we learn that his parents older brother have been killed early 1900s sicily that he has immigrated new york vito pays his dues learns tricks trade buying his time before deciding create his own small empire which would course grow become what we saw original it would seem that film would be confusing by jumping back forth between michael his father but that is not so coppola gives you just enough information keep audience intrigued through each segment film is very well made runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes many think that this installment is best series even though i still think that original is best i cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is definitive sequel 5 stars out 5,0.4709937209937211,0.2948416598416598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"Terrific continuation of the ""Godfather"" series; to call it a ""sequel"" almost seems insulting...","This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as ""sequel"" is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a sequel - ""The Godfather Part II"" is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in ""The Godfather Part II,"" Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. ""The Godfather"" was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. ""The Godfather Part II"" may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a ""sequel"" almost seems insulting.",terrific continuation godfather series call it sequel almost seems insulting,this sequel is just as terrific as first film if not more so i hesitate call it sequel as sequel is quite simply wrong word i am looking film like matrix reloaded is sequel godfather part ii is something more its just too good be called sequel film won six oscars 1974 including best picture best supporting actor robert de niro it deserved every one it involves viewer start never lets up particular aspects i enjoy this film are flashbacks don vito corleone as child immigrating new york city after social problems his homeland sicily i like intertwining michael corleone al pacino his son present day dealing with his crime inheritance vito robert de niro his father years ago i like how as michael comes terms with his family legacy film shows us vito coming terms with his future day he shoots that man gritty apartment complex is turning point his life every actor is top form here al pacino has gradually made move man who denies his future man who is accepting it his character is spotlight this film much more so than first film though both center around his decisions robert de niro is particularly wonderful convincing as young vito corleone who was course played by constantly spoofed marlon brando original de niro takes iron grip his character completely engulfs himself this was 1974 sign actor who would go places indeed he did coppolas magical sense direction is at work here as is script by coppola mario puzo whose novels series is based upon original was wonderful film but sequel presents more challenge flashbacks are often intercut middle other films are awkward times but godfather part ii coppola uses them at precisely right moments managing careen out scenes time periods with free abandon it takes great kind skill master something like this much less sequel one most beloved films all time godfather was instant classic upon its release 1972 coppola had two years plan his continuation film people told him it wouldnt work he would never beat original he would never pull it off but he showed them all godfather part ii may well be best sequel i have ever seen my entire lifetime i wish they were all this good call it sequel almost seems insulting,0.5498090145148969,0.22788388082505726,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10.0,"""Michael, I Never Wanted This For You.""","Nino Rota's musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rota's music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone family's many criminal actions, we understand that one doesn't have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We don't look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vito's father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vito's older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vito's hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vito's damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vito's sons.The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, ""You once told me: 'In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.' That was seven years ago."" What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michael's desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the film's closing shot.So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what could've been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, ""It had nothing to do with business."" The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once.",michael i never wanted this you,nino rotas musical score plays even greater role this equal but different successor than it did predecessor yearning lamenting stimulating bygone ages see how infectiously nino rotas music affects our sentiments savage events screen it is pulse films one cannot imagine them without their nino rota music against all our realistic deduction it guides us how feel about films condition us understand characters within their own world throughout corleone familys many criminal actions we understand that one doesnt have be monster order live with having done them what is both dual expansion its predecessor masterpiece juxtaposition itself we see michael corleone forfeit his remaining shreds morality become empty shell insecure merciless as his father quietly knew his latter days would be so michael has lost sight those values that made don corleone better than he had be has become new godfather every bit as evil as he has be score with its tonal harmony its honeyed emotional aesthetics is sad music can often evoke emotion more surely subtly than story consider several operas with ridiculous stories lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us tears devolution michael corleone is adjacent with flashbacks youth young manhood his father vito played with paternal home loving subtlety by robert de niro these scenes sicily old new york at turn century follow conventional pattern young man rise show mafia code being burned into corleone blood no false romanticism conceals necessity murder do business we dont look at vito as victim his environment but product depiction resorts which italian culture had turned initially both protect their homeland protect their livelihood as immigrants who came america be paid less than blacks film opens 1901 corleone sicily at funeral procession young vitos father who had been killed by local mafia chieftain don ciccio over insult during procession vitos older brother is also murdered because he swore avenge his father vitos mother goes ciccio beg life young vito when he refuses she sacrifices herself allow vito escape they scour town him warning sleeping townsfolk against harboring boy with aid few townspeople vito finds his way by ship ellis island where immigration agent mishearing vitos hometown corleone as his name registers him as vito corleone this very opening events that gradually follow we see that vitos damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense family his experience revenge as necessity was passed vitos sons life young vito helps explain forming adult don corleone as his unplanned successor michael his youngest child transforms we hark back why when his true desire is make corleone family completely legitimate he feels that he must play game by its old rules his wife says you once told me five years corleone family will be completely legitimate that was seven years ago what we have are two all too real narratives two superb lead performances lasting images there is even parallel between two elderly dons revenge must be had i admire way coppola puzo require us think along with michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving miami boss hyman roth his older brother fredo death sonny previous film who is against him why michael drifts several explanations past several key players misleading them all or nearly its like game blindfolded chess he has envision moves without seeing them coppola shows michael breaking under burden we recall that he was war hero successful college student forging honest life ultimately michael has no one by whom swear but his aging mother michaels desolation that scene dialogue informs films closing shot so this six time oscar winning three half hour gangster epic is ultimately dreary experience mourning what couldve been it is contrast with earlier film which don corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers young vito was murderer too as we more fully understand sicily new york scenes part ii but he was wise diplomatic murder was personal as hyman roth says it had nothing do with business crucial difference between father son is that vito is cognizant comprehending needs feelings problems views others michael grows very opposite direction whereas first movie was taut ensemble piece this second part is more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters neither whom share scenes with each other everyone else is periphery it must be seen as piece with consummate mastership godfather when characters film truly take simulated environmental existence us it becomes film that everyone who cherishes movies any extent should see at least once,0.4400855849131709,0.0711026521371349,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.35}"

As well the film shows us the early years of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) played flawlessly by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro, and how he created his empire of money, gambling and respect. Beautifully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Godfather Part II exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from Academy Award winners Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro. The second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest films ever made. This is cinematic art. A treasure of film history. The finest sequel ever made. A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppola's second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part.

10.0,An Insult To Call It A Sequel,"To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one.",insult call it sequel,me probably many other people godfather part ii is more continuation than sequel godfather just look at imdb rating youll see im not only one who feels this way me it as good as first acting may have been better than acting original robert de niro gave perfect subtle performance as vito corleone his portrayal was powerful breathtaking when i think de niro i definitely do not think subtle smooth but that is exactly what he was here it is definitely one his top three performances his career depth his portrayal was able justify vito corleone that marlon brando portrayed first al pacino gave very strong performance playing michael corleone here we get see more tough decisions that have be made consequences certain actions al pacino perfectly displayed amount thought struggle that goes into comes out every action you make way it affects relationships family power influence diane keaton was not really given lot room act first but here she is very good she did not play stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather woman with mind her own who is willing go after what she feels she deserves robert duvall again me was glue movie just having him there kind makes you feel safe john cazale also had more impact here than first playing half witted brother always needing be bailed out lot these characters sound so familiar stereotypical but godfather part ii every character is played out with such extraordinary depth everyone talia shire who gave fine performance lee strasberg all way down kid who played young vito corleone were perfect part ii seems me be more character study than original directing once again is perfect francis ford coppola know or at least knew how make movie first godfather movie are done so precisely perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type cast he has here not many movies can maintain such consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even hour 45 minutes writing may not have been quite as good as first terms quoting but storyline was perfect seeing decisions made by new mob boss michael corleone was common sense but flashing back vito corleones life was genius storyline me could not have been better coppola puzo do great job with it all way like first cinematography was amazing but it had slightly different tone it first had more majestic mythical look it part ii you feel modern times creeping corleones having adjust it part ii has more corrupt evil twist it but i guess end signifies that music obviously same as first was perfect just fit so greatly with rest movie first movies godfather series are really like same movie they are not same though they are actually very different but greatness them both continuation storyline first second really create strong band between each other me it is only sequel that it was second movie great series no let downs no disappointments just continuation greatness first one,0.5459534331409334,0.26567227332852333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"

9.0,"Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under ""sprawl""","Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) ""in the role"" of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the ""inside"" was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended ""flashback"" segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call ""J.K. Rowling Syndrome"". That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.",excellent but could be dictionary under sprawl,series note it is almost unthinkable watch this film without having seen godfather 1972 first this is direct continuation that story good news is that godfather part ii has many amazing qualities including fantastic performances superb cast sublime unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able capture since very engaging stories bad news is that this should have easily been 10 but overall it is so sprawling unfocused that i cant possibly give it more than 9 which it only earns because assets transcend whats basically mess overall because it should have been 10 most other reviews will tell you about positive points at length i may pick more things my review than you would think i would 9 but rest assured that even with flaws godfather part ii is still essential viewing director co writer francis ford coppola cleverly begins film with parallels godfather we see michael corleone al pacino role his father vito marlon brando first film accepting prostrating guests while party is going outside like first film party consumes lot time while we get know some principal characters perhaps during this segment perhaps bit after we realize that maybe beginning wasnt so clever after all because structure godfather part ii parallels godfather broad perspective as if coppola co writer mario puzo used first film as something template create this one after party is over there is attempted hit michael we quickly learn that not everything is rosy corleones mafia world michael believes that someone inside was involved with hit this launches complicated sequence events that has michael who is now living nevada traveling miami cuba new york so he accuses different people involvement attempted hit depending whom he is talking this may have all been part grand scheme set up responsible parties but one flaws film is that coppola doesnt convey michaels underlying thoughts about this very well not even later not through his actions rather than feeling like clever set up it starts feel like slightly muddled writing during middle section film which goes hours we also have hint problem that plagued godfather bloated cast there are bit too many characters who arent well enough presented or explained you may need keep scorecard coppola puzo also treat us many extended flashback segments i mean way back vito as boy young man played by robert de niro my money these were best scenes film although maybe thats bit my bias creeping as im huge de niro fan but lets talk about main plague film sprawl this is maybe first evident flashbacks as good as they are they go far too long happen far too frequently sustain momentum either michael story or vito as youngster story it begins feel like were toggling back forth between two films which is track that should have been taken prequel at least would have been solid 10 theres also lot sprawl michael corleone segments coppola appears have been suffering what id now call j k rowling syndrome that happens when artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor s instead taking good advice about where trim fat artist decides just leave much it they now have clout override any dissenting more sensible opinions michael corleone story has lot fat including much cuba material example sitting around table with president laboriously passing around solid gold telephone senate hearings which go far too long make provide dramatic points so film begins feel more like couple seasons television show that coppola tried cram into 3 half hour film or worse collection deleted scenes scenes except fat that needed be trimmed are excellent isolation but by time climax rolls around whole has more arbitrary feeling this is especially clear d nouement which seems just end ive barely left myself room talk about good points first one which most people mention is acting there isnt bad performance film but pacino de niro some relatively minor characters like those played by diane keaton talia shire john cazale really stand out second outstanding point similar first film is beautiful visuals although all cinematography production design is great what really impressed me were some darkly lit scenes characters features sets emerge pitch blackness everything is rich deep shades burgundy brown orange amazingly nothing gets lost these scenes it must be incredibly difficult achieve without making shots too dark because i cant remember another film since that has been able capture same look flashback scenes are also similar but lighter colors creating appropriate sepia tone feel although broad perspective problems are unfortunate closer focus most segments film provides exemplary artistry given that films importance culturally godfather part ii is must see,0.5168712121212121,0.197616391184573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,One of the best sequels ever made,"I do have to agree that calling Godfather Part II a sequel is rather insulting. It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.For one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.The acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox",one best sequels ever made,i do have agree that calling godfather part ii sequel is rather insulting it is one those rare sequels that almost outdoes first considering how amazing first godfather was that says lot godfather part ii is longer but some ways it is also richer people may say like with first it is slow takes while unfold course but i think that was deliberate both this first godfather have elegiac quality them that makes them even more compelling one thing film is very well made cinematography is simply gorgeous whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque settings are wondrous music once again is outstanding it is haunting sticks your head very long time then there is brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent thoughtful masterly direction francis ford coppola fabulously constructed story film does have some wonderful scenes scenes where vito flees sicily has grandeur silent movie while scenes cuba actually avoid being clumsy confusing climax is extremely chilling not mention pop goes weasel scene which was very funny acting is superb once again vito is brilliantly portrayed by robert deniro one his better performances i was also taken with robert duvall as loyal tom john cazale diane keaton but picture belongs al pacino he was great carrying first godfather movie but he is even better here he is simply phenomenal be honest i think he should have won that oscar overall amazing film one best sequels ever be conceived 10 10 bethany cox,0.593625,0.33233333333333337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.19}"

9.0,As good as the original...,"Sequel to the original Godfather is slower moving than the original but maybe better. The first was fresh material and Brando's presence was a huge plus. But this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main characters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of the most prolific actors today.Michael's descent into darkness is terrible to behold. Tragedy surrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates himself in the process. Hey, it's not easy holding a crime empire together. I think this film sets out to make Michael a tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? It's a cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. Very interesting final scene, grim and stark, as Michael sits contemplating on a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him.Pacino's performance is magnificent. Some great scenes, especially when Michael realizes Fredo betrayed him. That simple movement of covering his forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. Michael becomes a three dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first. Pacino just nails the part.The secondary story is the rise of Michael's father, Vito Corleone and we watch the birth of a star. DeNiro even surpasses Pacino in his part, if that is possible. The calculating Vito as he calmly stalks Don Fanucci from the rooftops is classic film. DeNiro plays the role of Death himself: knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance. How many other hit men in the movies borrowed DeNiro's look? What the Godfather does, unlike so many other films of it's generation is convey thought in simple movements. Watch DeNiro as he pales visibly, staring at an old Italian remedy of his sick baby. We know right then that Vito Corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and save his family. Watch him as Don Fanucci boards his car and leans on him. By DeNiro's expression, we know Fanucci is already a dead man. That's unsurpassed acting.The sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best cinematography I have seen in any movie. Early 1900's New York, in the Italian neighborhood is unreal. Watch the pedestrians and background movement while the focus of the scene is occurring. That's sheer magic. Once again, watch Hyman Roth in Cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a gentle wind moving the drapes. We can practically feel the heat and hear and smell the city of Havana. It made me think how much care and calculation was put into this movie.Some weak points: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth was not on par with the other actors. Gazzo as Pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially in the first hour. I was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear in the rest of the film. The rest of the cast is great as usual, especially Duvall and Kirby. Not much to complain about.The second Godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of Vito vs. Michael. They both have different motivations for ruling their empire. Whereas Vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty and provide for his family out of love, Michael rules out of ruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. You can see where the results have taken both.One of the greatest films of all time.",as good as original,sequel original godfather is slower moving than original but maybe better first was fresh material brandos presence was huge plus but this one digs into blood guts two main characters provoking more thought as well as introducing us one most prolific actors today michaels descent into darkness is terrible behold tragedy surrounds him as he struggles maintain his empire but alienates himself process hey its not easy holding crime empire together i think this film sets out make michael tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy guy who murders family members its cold world obviously takes strong man stay top very interesting final scene grim stark as michael sits contemplating chair watching dead leaves blow around him pacinos performance is magnificent some great scenes especially when michael realizes fredo betrayed him that simple movement covering his forehead shock despair conveys so much michael becomes three dimensional character this film as opposed first pacino just nails part secondary story is rise michaels father vito corleone we watch birth star deniro even surpasses pacino his part if that is possible calculating vito as he calmly stalks don fanucci rooftops is classic film deniro plays role death himself knife thin pale yet slick immaculate appearance how many other hit men movies borrowed deniros look what godfather does unlike so many other films its generation is convey thought simple movements watch deniro as he pales visibly staring at old italian remedy his sick baby we know right then that vito corleone will do whatever it takes protect save his family watch him as don fanucci boards his car leans him by deniros expression we know fanucci is already dead man thats unsurpassed acting sets are beautiful behold this is probably best cinematography i have seen any movie early 1900s new york italian neighborhood is unreal watch pedestrians background movement while focus scene is occurring thats sheer magic once again watch hyman roth cuba lie couch shirtless gentle wind moving drapes we can practically feel heat hear smell city havana it made me think how much care calculation was put into this movie some weak points lee strasberg as hyman roth was not par with other actors gazzo as pentangeli just grated my nerves especially first hour i was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear rest film rest cast is great as usual especially duvall kirby not much complain about second godfather tries do what first does study vito vs michael they both have different motivations ruling their empire whereas vito tries do whatever it takes rise poverty provide his family out love michael rules out ruthlessness need succeed maintain his empire you can see where results have taken both one greatest films all time,0.5535717377860235,0.12603988868274582,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,"About as good as the first one, but mainly because of De Niro","It's rare to see a sequel that is as good as the first; it's even rarer to see the two acting veterans, De Niro and Pacino, together in a film. This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10",about as good as first one but mainly because de niro,its rare see sequel that is as good as first its even rarer see two acting veterans de niro pacino together film this is only film that delivers both i loved first godfather film its acting talent its cinematography its fantastic story acting is every bit as great cinematography is about as good but story wasnt exactly as good as first had it not been flashbacks that showed vito as young beautifully portrayed by de niro it wouldnt have gotten perfect rating me he saved film that was otherwise slow little bland due story not being as great as first first showed us mafia war this just shows aftermath michael corleones further rise power after fall vito first however film has number flashbacks that show us vito as young here de niro perfectly shows us entire range his talents by mimicking brandos performance perfection plot is good but not as good as first its saved by flashback sequences that show us how why vito corleone came power acting is every bit as great as first al pacino still gives great performance like he did first other cast members who came back first including robert duvall diane keaton also give as great performances as they did first new actors also give great performances though following stand out as best robert de niro lee strasberg michael v gazzo characters are as well written as they were first mafia is portrayed as menacingly this as it was first film like first has its share memorable quotes but not really any scenes that were memorable like first one had all all great film but mainly because de niro pacino de niro fills brandos part fairly well but overall film isnt as entertaining exciting as first though it does reach about same quality overall i recommend it fans various actors involved course anyone who enjoyed first as they should enjoy this one too but possibly lesser extent 10 10,0.497247119078105,0.30444408877507473,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.16}"
8.0,"Good, but not as good as the first","A lot of people seem to consider THE GODFATHER PART II to be the best film ever made, a film that's even better than it's already excellent predecessor. Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While this movie is very good, and as well made as the original, I think the original has the edge.The reason for that is the script, which was just better, and more involved, the first time around. Here, there are dual narratives, one of which follows the traditional sequel route of showing that happened to the Corleone family after the events of the first movie, while the second is a prequel revealing how Vito Corleone became the mafia boss he ended up as.While I love Robert De Niro and I enjoyed the flashback scenes, I felt this whole sequence was slightly unnecessary. From the material given, the viewer can already guess how the De Niro character rose through the ranks and the events we witness feel a little bit superfluous. Sure, the pair of assassination scenes are excellent, but the rest just feels obvious and expected.Meanwhile, the Pacino narrative also has its problems, although cast and director aren't at fault; Coppola reunites many of his principals here and to excellent effect. However, there isn't nearly as much incident in the narrative and the whole story feels a little dragged out, a little over-emphasised. In the first film, the Pacino character had three or four major plot points to deal with, whereas this time the events are limited; for example, the entire film focuses on the situation with Roth, whereas in THE GODFATHER that would have just taken up half an hour or so. Therefore the ending, when it comes, is admittedly powerful, but not as effective in comparison to the genuinely amazing things we saw in the first film. It's been done before, and apart from a little more depth and character focus, we can't take much more away from this sequel. So it's very good, but not quite up there to the level of the first.",good but not as good as first,lot people seem consider godfather part ii be best film ever made film thats even better than its already excellent predecessor unfortunately i have disagree while this movie is very good as well made as original i think original has edge reason that is script which was just better more involved first time around here there are dual narratives one which follows traditional sequel route showing that happened corleone family after events first movie while second is prequel revealing how vito corleone became mafia boss he ended up as while i love robert de niro i enjoyed flashback scenes i felt this whole sequence was slightly unnecessary material given viewer can already guess how de niro character rose through ranks events we witness feel little bit superfluous sure pair assassination scenes are excellent but rest just feels obvious expected meanwhile pacino narrative also has its problems although cast director arent at fault coppola reunites many his principals here excellent effect however there isnt nearly as much incident narrative whole story feels little dragged out little over emphasised first film pacino character had three or four major plot points deal with whereas this time events are limited example entire film focuses situation with roth whereas godfather that would have just taken up half hour or so therefore ending when it comes is admittedly powerful but not as effective comparison genuinely amazing things we saw first film its been done before apart little more depth character focus we cant take much more away this sequel so its very good but not quite up there level first,0.5735524499654934,0.3205305383022774,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Godfather of all sequels,"The Godfather Part II is a consummation of the saga of the Corleone Crime family. Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vito's death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michael's journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brando's portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppola's brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzo's masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rota's poignant score and Gordon Willis' vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",potpourri vestiges review godfather all sequels,godfather part ii is consummation saga corleone crime family regarded by many as best sequel ever godfather part ii is equally brilliant as its precursor good enough stand its own movie juxtaposes early life vito corleone his orphaned childhood his rise power new york with life his son michael after vitos death michael becoming most powerful mafia head al pacino picks up where he left first part consummating michaels journey dark side process presenting him as greatest anti hero western cinema ever embodied movie gave pacino his third consecutive oscar nomination perpetual stardom that catapulted him above ruck laying foundations his illustrious career just like part i his performance this movie is absolutely worthy oscar but academy once again robbed him glory robert de niro his oscar winning portrayal vito corleone gives great performance without uttering single word english synergy imparted by brilliance these two outstanding performers makes movie treat watch robert duvall reprises his role tom hagen with desired degree subtlety equanimity reminding viewer brandos portrayal godfather part i entire cast is brilliant with special mention john cazole as fredo lee strasberg as hyman roth michael v gazzo as frankie pentageli who are outstanding say least cuppolas brilliant innovative direction gives puzos masterful story incredible impetus which is well complemented by nino rotas poignant score gordon willis vivid cinematography nutshell movie though sanguinary lengthy than its precursor is equally brilliant work cinema profound deeply engrossing master piece,0.6249629756208703,0.3898353839143313,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Not Far Behind The First Film,"This isn't quite as powerful as the first Godfather, done two years earlier, but it isn't far behind. It's another magnificently filmed effort, wonderfully acted and a hard film to stop once you've put it in your tape or DVD player.What makes this a notch below the first Godfather is the absence of Marlon Brando and a little too much disjointedness with flashbacks. Also missing from this film was the volatile James Caan. He was shown in a flashback scene near the end, and that was it.One thing was just as good if not better than the first film, and that was the cinematography. The browns, blacks, greens and yellows are just great treats for the eyes. I especially love the Italian houses and scenery. Why this was not even nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography is mind-boggling.The story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother Michael (Al Pacino). It also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth.There are some excellent supporting performances in this film, too. I especially would cite the roles played by Michael Gazzo and Lee Strassburg.",not far behind first film,this isnt quite as powerful as first godfather done two years earlier but it isnt far behind its another magnificently filmed effort wonderfully acted hard film stop once youve put it your tape or dvd player what makes this notch below first godfather is absence marlon brando little too much disjointedness with flashbacks also missing this film was volatile james caan he was shown flashback scene near end that was it one thing was just as good if not better than first film that was cinematography browns blacks greens yellows are just great treats eyes i especially love italian houses scenery why this was not even nominated academy award cinematography is mind boggling story centers around brutal vengeance youngest brother michael al pacino it also gives good demonstration how gangster lifestyle may look attractive outside but really is unhappy one despite wealth there are some excellent supporting performances this film too i especially would cite roles played by michael gazzo lee strassburg,0.5991935483870968,0.18333333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,"Great ensemble acting, great story, greatest sequel ever made.","The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see.",great ensemble acting great story greatest sequel ever made,godfather part 2 is finest sequel ever made is arguably finer film than original godfather film is divided into two main parts story young vito corleone flawlessly acted by robert de niro worthy oscar winner rise power michael as head family francis coppola recollaborated with many crew members first film again achieves quite superb period piece thanks cinematography gordon willis set design dean tavoularis acting performances are outstanding hence three supporting oscar nominations acting guru lee strasberg hyman roth michael gazzo frank pentangeli robert de niro young vito corleone duvall keaton cazale shire all provided first rate performances but it is performance al pacino which steals show expertly portraying michael as cool calculating suspicious don corleone film expands upon original movie brings us into familys activities nevada florida havana arguably finest movie 70s cinematic masterpiece with greatest ensemble acting you will probably see,0.5197916666666667,0.38958333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.27}"
