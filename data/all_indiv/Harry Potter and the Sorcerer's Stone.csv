8.0,The major start of all the magic!,"Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films.

10.0,There's nothing like the first,"There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.",theres nothing like first,theres nothing like first series is there introduction characters immersion into fictional world first time you laugh cry care fear someones safety can never be repeated no matter how many harry potter movies they crank out or if they ever remake them future none will come close wonderful first film harry potter sorcerers stone im sure everyone has their own childhood memories reading harry potter books that theyll tell their grandkids about but ill never forget going see first movie theaters lights dimmed john williamss perfect theme played its first notes as richard harris walked down privet drive everyone theater was transported another world john williamss numerous themes all wonderful personification wizarding world took early movies another level as other composers tried their hands at later films that quality was missing theres something truly special about going see this movie big screen while magical qualities might not all be credited music its certainly one them welcome world harry potter where if youre ten year old kid who doesnt fit you might get letter delivered by owl telling you you have magical powers should go special school hone them believe it or not there are people who watch this movie without reading books so bit description is necessary obviously stars show are children who were selected out millions other kids be able memorize lines not look camera endear themselves worldwide audiences hopefully act daniel radcliffe emma watson rupert grint tom felton are so cute tiny this first movie youll undoubtedly find yourself re watching it as years pass just see them as kids again i always marvel that child actors train themselves not look camera so even if their performances arent perfect i cut them slack knowing firsthand how hard it is these kids had dress funny costumes recite incantations without laughing pretend theyre looking at things that were added post production usually kids movies theres grown up or two who add cast make adult audience members feel less silly that theyre watching it harry potter movies everyone wanted be them throughout series youll see host familiar faces as guest stars but regulars will make special places your heart richard harris maggie smith alan rickman robbie coltrane are household names little kids because theyre so convincing as kindhearted dumbledore wizened but sentimental mcgonagall endlessly mimicable snape jolly hagrid kids today cant imagine theyve had any other career prior these movies is there any kid who doesnt immediately attribute word earwax richard harris point out striped cats as maggie smith cats mumble shouldnt have said that when they make mistake or practice putting pauses their sentences like alan rickman first movies are so special since they introduce audiences world that will hopefully capture their attention however many more movies will be made j k rowlings fantasy world theres so much fall love with film adaptation you can really believe it exists seeing hogwarts structure first time creates special feeling your heart that can only be recaptured by watching movie again or going see next series great hall quidditch sorting hat talking portraits flying lessons selecting perfect wand all these harry potter moments are perfectly recreated first series that saw entire generation grow up buying toy wands trying bertie botts every flavor beans each installment has its special moments this first one has quite few even outside exposition if three headed dog doesnt immediately conjure name fluffy chess pieces have never come life your imagination you dont laugh at idea counting your birthday presents you dont know what richard harris wants most world youre missing out one great joys life if somehow 2001 passed you by without trip movie theaters thanksgiving weekend go find yourself copy this iconic lovely movie,0.5058265582655826,0.2381799264421216,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,The Magic Comes To Life!,"Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born: A boy. A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world. And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves. Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard. But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was. It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard. When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born: The gift of magic! And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.	What a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life. And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job. More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special. The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end. From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter. And it's magic.	Even having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part. And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here. Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it. A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.	Also turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione. As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect. Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing. And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.	It's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell. Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable: Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation. 	The additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch). From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone. A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here. An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages. A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.",magic comes life,once upon time not that long ago vivid fertile imagination author j k rowling character was born boy young boy named harry who was destined become one most beloved characters emerge work fiction long long time was quickly embraced by young old alike all corners world now thanks magic cinema harry his companions fairly leap pages novel silver screen phenomenal motion picture harry potter sorcerers stone directed by chris columbus written screen by steve kloves indeed harry potter is boy but not just any boy because harry daniel radcliffe just happens be wizard but orphaned as baby harry has been raised by his aunt petunia fiona shaw uncle vernon dursley richard griffiths who never let him fact that he was well what he was it seems that petunia didnt approve her own sister harrys mother because she was witch nor harrys father because he too was wizard when harry turns eleven however secret is out bag when after some strange goings giant man named rubeus hagrid robbie coltrane shows up at dursleys door collect harry take him off hogwarts school wizards witches all who would perfect gift with which they were born gift magic moment harry boards train station platform nine three quarters that will take him his destiny magic is alive harry audience as well its journey you will never forget what monumental undertaking even think attempting translating transferring this passionately beloved work novel screen because millions people harry his companions are so much more than merely characters book these are characters whom people have made special place their hearts which puts great burden trust upon man who would attempt bring them life chris columbus it turns out was right man job more than rising occasion with some magic his own lot help extraordinarily talented cast crew columbus has delivered film that is not only true story but true very spirit that makes harry potter so special special effects are absolutely beyond astounding columbus with keen eye detail without missing beat keeps it all track moving right along at pace with sense timing that makes this absorbing thoroughly entertaining enjoyable experience beginning end opening frame you get feeling that youre about have singular experience youre right because youve just entered world harry potter its magic even having best special effects do not great movie make however this film is no exception what catapults this one top are performances beginning with radcliffe whom you quickly forget is actor playing part that about sums up what kind job this young man does here without question he is harry potter physically emotionally when he waves his wand does what he does you believe it wonderful performance by gifted actor who has great career ahead him without question perfect choice role harry also turning excellent performances are rupert grint as ron weasley emma watson as hermione as with radcliffe casting here could not have been more perfect grint is everyboy with that special glint his eye manner that makes him especially endearing spunky watson adds some real sparkle film as hermione one with sense urgency wherewithal get things done real role model young girls everywhere its obvious that lot care went into casting this film its big part why it is so successful richard harris as headmaster albus dumbledore maggie smith as professor mcgonagall john hurt as mr ollivander ian hart as professor quirrell exceptional performances one all with two that stand out as especially memorable robbie coltrane who readily conveys fact that hagrids heart is size that matches that man alan rickman as professor severus snape deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through fine art articulation additional supporting cast includes john cleese nearly headless nick warwick davis professor flitwick julie walters mrs weasley zoe wanamaker madame hooch tom felton draco malfoy harry melling dudley david bradley filch rowlings imagination written page real life albeit via movie screen harry potter sorcerers stone is triumph many times over unique film truly universal appeal likes which is as rare as well sorcerers stone film which adults children alike will rejoice because it speaks heart universal language life love experience imagination film that states unequivocally that magic exists as long as theres single child with single dream somewhere world real wizards like j k rowling chris columbus steve kloves every member this wonderful cast crew around bring it life as they have here instant classic every sense word this is truly film ages remarkable achievement this is magic movies i rate this one 10 10,0.6386967418546363,0.3654385964912282,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Better Than Anticipated,"Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids, loosely taken from the source.

,Alohomora - of the magical world...,"I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.Without going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.Every character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.CGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.Let's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch.",alohomora magical world,i watched this movie first time when i was left with no choice my expectations were extremely low as i always wondered if harry potter books were over hyped how ever after watching movie it did make me harry potter movie fan needless say this continues remain my favourite hp series that brings point here effect expectations over movie true expectations reduce joy without going into story i would certainly say chris columbus churns out perfect pot pourri emotions suspense magic delivering something appealing all ages every character brought life screen has done justice leave impression you particularly notable performances by emma watson alan rickman cgi are plenty made good quedditch game is picturised amazingly wizards chess is treat eyes lets hope that forthcoming hp series carries similar magical touch,0.6091036414565827,0.3243697478991597,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
7.0,"Wonderful adaptation, but missing the satire of the book","I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",wonderful adaptation but missing satire book,i enjoyed this movie immensely but like phantom menace ive had very hard time viewing it objectively there was so much anticipation

8.0,Epic film,"Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out.",epic film,ah first film adaptation beloved harry potter series harry potter is 11 year old boy who comes find out that he is wizard he lives with his uncaring muggle non magic aunt uncle cousin since his parents died when he was baby they were murdered by dark powerful evil wizard named lord voldemort harry would be dead too but was miraculously saved making him something legend upon learning his guarded magic roots harry gets enrolled hogwarts british school witches wizards while there he learns come into his own meet people that are actually good him learn more his dark past looking back i dont know if it was good idea have chris columbus direct this as he does have reputation being something hack albeit decent one i think his direction is okay here yeah retrospectively it could have been better but it could also have been much worse at least with him at helm we get good amount whimsy go along with bit menace thats good thing as book was likewise not too heavy darker stuff though that sure changed as time went many liberties are taken which is weird since book is quite short film is two half hours it does get point across decently enough though also works as piece those unfamiliar with source material john williams provides great music theres wonderful art direction set design theres some nifty set pieces too featuring all british cast this film is impeccably cast performances are good too finding decent child actors is hard but they really scored here my enjoyment this movie has waned over time but its still not terrible piece work by any means so check it out,0.5654392764857882,0.2215116279069767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Great fun!,"I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox",great fun,i really liked this film but i much prefer book which has lot more magic wonder daniel radcliffe is very likable as harry he is given solid support by funny rupert grint good emma watson though she was annoying at times scene stealer was definitely robbie coltrane i actually cant imagine anyone else playing hagrid coltrane was just hilarious alan rickman maggie smith were also great but me standout was late richard harris now i much prefer harriss interpretation dumbledore he was soft spoken actually fitted part better both these qualities were lost interpretation that michael gambon gave i am not saying that michael gambon was bad he just wasnt my ideal choice harriss replacement film is fairly faithful its source material looks very beautiful however it is bit long very young children may find voldemort too frightening i know because i have triplet brother sisters who saw it couldnt sleep about month after viewing conclusion very good film well performed quite dark 8 10 bethany cox,0.6022988505747126,0.26689655172413795,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.23}"
8.0,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Review,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.I am going with an 8/10.",harry potter philosophers stone review,harry potter philosophers stone is film directed by chris columbus many years i hadnt given damn about harry potter series but seeing fanfare surrounded by series i decided give it try after watching this one i can definitely say that i am verge being fan plot harry potter orphan living with his uncle his family is invited hogwarts school magic become wizard story direction i had watched this part around time it released but never just kept touch since i didnt understand word seeing it now as adult movie lover i just fell love with this fictional world created characters settings story etc all just feel seamless thanks j k rowling steve kloves chris columbus who have done justice source material provided them i feel themes are so very relevant this film intricacies those themes are valid current world we do live this is what i just exactly want any story presented me although film is very long i never felt bored single moment adapt quite huge novel comes with responsibility precaution which makers completely justified sets are huge awesome you just feel you are hogwarts actually also each characters costume is just marvel at john williams once again just proves why he is composer century but i did feel some flaws film being first film main plot film comes at around 90th minute film also vfx film felt very amateur considering some great vfx was done years preceding this film performances i would say that casting film is just perfect applause casting team is deserved never do you feel that another actor should play role kids daniel radcliffe rupert grint emma watson tom felon just name few are fantastic these 10 11 year old just steal your heart also other cast like richard harris maggie smith alan rickman robbie coltrane make themselves likable favorite scene there were many favourite scenes this film me but one scene particular was troll scene where harry ron decide save hermione after saving hermione vouches boys this is scene where you actually happen see bond solidified between 3 as friends verdict anyone who just loves fantasy film worlds with great visuals this film is just you i assure you wont be disappointed i plan seeing entire series now because i am fascinated by this world want see what else has it got offer i am going with 8 10,0.5265601503759398,0.22245443153337888,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,~*-The Magical Journey Begins-*~,"When I first saw this movie I was ten years old, the same age the characters where supposed to be. My older cousin and her boyfriend took me to the Mall to watch a movie. Back then I wasn't going very often to the cinema, due to the fact that my parents didn't have time and I wasn't old enough to go alone to any theater. The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn't had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it. That's how I became obsessed with reading and writing.I may say, ""Harry Potter"" affected me in a positive way, because after I finished reading all the published books back then, I wanted to read more books and I must thank J.K.Rowling for her genius, if it wasn't for her books, I might have been right now an average seventeen year old, at some party, drinking my brains out. This movie got me to the right path in life.I know, you probably don't care about my story, you readers only want to hear about what I thought of the movie, but I believe my story can influence you if you are a parent and thinking whether or not you should let your children watch this film.

7.0,"This movie set in stone, what would be the foundation of the Harry Potter film franchise. It kinda work.","It's seem like just yesterday, when the movie about the boy whom lived, was about to come out. People were wondering if the Harry Potter's books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone AKA Sorcerer's Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form: its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn't play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley's family when he knows that they're horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don't care if they're wizards in training, I'm surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn't as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times. A good example of this stupidity, is punishing students whom went out at nights, by sending them out at nights in the dark forest, where they can get attacked by creatures. The most insulting thing in logic is the black/white one-dimensional view of good Vs evil. Honestly, how on earth is the members of Slytherin never got expulsion for all the bullies that it has? You would think, that at less, there would be one good person in Slytherin. Another thing that bugs me is the whole the power of love conquer all. I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn't say that Harry Potter's film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they're saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It's so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn't aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling's first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn't good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying ""philosopher's"" and once with ""sorcerer's"". Overall: The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan.",this movie set stone what would be foundation harry potter film franchise it kinda work,its seem like

,Pure cinematic magic,"To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling's beloved novel ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" hits the screen.Each of Rowling's four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling's world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It's the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There's not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book's most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match (a soccer/hockey/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard's chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously. Screenwriter Steven Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling's tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it's played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling's book. In the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry's sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch. As the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" remains true to the book, we'll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film's tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin.",pure cinematic magic,millions children all ages november 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than christmas as long awaited film version j k rowlings beloved novel harry potter sorcerors stone hits screen each rowlings four harry potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best sellers turning generation video game playing children into avid readers translating rowlings world wizards magic screen film makers claimed be intensely aware fans high expectations had sworn be faithful book harry potter sorcerors stone is indeed most loyal film adaptation book that this fan has ever seen its story orphaned boy who discovers his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards that he is fact famous powerful wizard himself released clutches his desperately ordinary non magical uncle vernon aunt petunia their deliciously obnoxious son dudley harry takes his place wizarding world as first year student at venerated hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry great deal harry potter sorcerors stone is introduction this fantastic dangerous world its richly drawn characters theres not only lot plot cover this film but entire world create at two half hours long hit restroom before it starts film includes books most memorable scenes bringing many them life with pure cinematic wizardry quidditch match soccer hockey rugby thing played broomsticks is much more exciting screen than page as is bathroom battle with enormous mountain troll larger than life game wizards chess frightening aspects book are full force film its pg rating some scary moments should be taken seriously screenwriter steven kloves wonder boys has done fine job streamlining rowlings tale while maintaining its spirit director chris columbus home alone makes good his promise be faithful book but at times film is bit too reverent you want actors cut loose have bit more fun columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when its played most real across board his fine ensemble actors are so perfectly cast that they appear have literally stepped out rowlings book title role daniel radcliffe pulls off very difficult task playing introverted hero who spends most movie reacting amazing sights events around him he beautifully captures deep soul untapped potential harry potter when this kid smiles screen lights up rupert grint is delightful as harrys sardonic buddy ron weasley emma watson nearly steals film as their overachieving friend hermione granger three cheers film makers giving three unknown child actors top billing they deserve strong cast veteran actors includes richard harris as wise headmaster dumbledore robbie coltrane as lovable giant hagrid alan rickman is wonderfully villainous as professor snape zoe wanamaker has just right touch girls gym teacher as flying instructor madame hooch as strict but just professor mcgonagall oscar winner maggie smith seems born play role is ready another oscar john cleese as nearly headless nick julie walters as mrs weasley have all too brief cameo roles but if next film harry potter chamber secrets remains true book well be seeing more them addition being highly engaging film is marvelous thing look at bustling wizard street diagon alley magnificently gothic hogwarts school dark misty forbidden forest film breaks new ground imaginative production design paraphrase films tagline let magic box office records begin,0.6336248870177441,0.2864134080205509,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Good Start to the Series,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) *** (out of 4)Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is taken away from his obnoxious and abusive aunt and uncle and taken to the Hogwarts Academy where he's going to learn to become a wizard. He becomes friends with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). It doesn't take long for Potter to learn about his past as well as what's expected of him in the future.I'm going to be really honest and admit that I've never read a single line of any of the novels and in all honesty I never really paid too much attention to what they were even about. I'm watching this first film on March 15, 2016 so that's nearly fifteen years since this was released so obviously you can't say I'm a fan of anything involving the characters. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into the movie but by the time the end credits started there's no doubt that I was left entertained.I thought for the most part this was a pretty entertaining film and I think everyone got it right in regards to the casting. I mean the three leads are all extremely good for their roles and I thought all of them managed to help carry the film. Radcliffe was certainly believable in the role of this master wizard and I thought both Grint and Watson added a lot of charm. Then you've got the likes of John Cleese, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, Maggie Smith and Richard Harris.I'm not normally a fan of CGI heavy movies but I thought it was perfectly used here and never really took away from the story. Instead of taking away from the story it actually did a very good job at adding to this alternative universe and the various magic that is to be found in it. Technically speaking the film was certainly well made with a ripping score, great effects as well as fine editing and cinematography. If I had to say anything negative about the picture it would be the incredibly long running time.",good start series,harry potter sorcerers stone 2001 out 4 harry potter daniel radcliffe is taken away his obnoxious abusive aunt uncle taken hogwarts academy where hes going learn become wizard he becomes friends with ron weasley rupert grint hermione granger emma watson it doesnt take long potter learn about his past as well as whats expected him future im going be really honest admit that ive never read single line any novels all honesty i never really paid too much attention what they were even about im watching this first film march 15 2016 so thats nearly fifteen years since this was released so obviously you cant say im fan anything involving characters i really wasnt sure what expect going into movie but by time end credits started theres no doubt that i was left entertained i thought most part this was pretty entertaining film i think everyone got it right regards casting i mean three leads are all extremely good their roles i thought all them managed help carry film radcliffe was certainly believable role this master wizard i thought both grint watson added lot charm then youve got likes john cleese alan rickman john hurt maggie smith richard harris im not normally fan cgi heavy movies but i thought it was perfectly used here never really took away story instead taking away story it actually did very good job at adding this alternative universe various magic that is be found it technically speaking film was certainly well made with ripping score great effects as well as fine editing cinematography if i had say anything negative about picture it would be incredibly long running time,0.4885041887125219,0.20882605820105823,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7.0,"It's a true adaptation, but lacks an edge like the novel. *** (out of four)","HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)Here's a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based? Before the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me. With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences. That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects. ""Harry Potter"" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry? The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not. After his gentle ""Home Alone"" and sweet-natured ""Stepmom,"" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. ""Harry Potter"" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define ""Harry Potter"" as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion: It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?",its true adaptation but lacks edge like novel out four,harry potter 2001 out four heres method evaluating movie based previously published material ask yourself if film makes you want read material which it is based before release harry potter sorcerers stone i was one few remaining souls who had not read j k rowlings fantasy book series after screening first film installment i did want read book borrowing novel family member i briefly skimmed over chapters books intelligence similarities with film really surprised me with over 100 million copies sold over 46 different languages j k rowlings best selling series books has become worldwide phenomenon naturally with soaring expectations abound filmmakers felt great pressure create faithful adaptation they have this film is essentially visualization words novel with very few differences that said film does run into few conflicts with books story middle movie has nowhere go its like false second act almost nothing major significance occurs this period film young characters wander scene scene with nothing much do nothing much say were left with grand display eye popping special effects harry potter certainly dazzles us with solid beginning engaging final act however we first meet young wizard boy named harry potter daniel radcliffe soon after film opens boy discovers he has magical powers hes then thrust into enchanting world sorcery magic witchcraft hes sent school young wizard children where he meets new friends learns about magic participates fun competitions but someone at school doesnt like harry as mysterious events begin occur harry soon finds himself middle diabolical scheme revenge who is culprit what do they want with harry film asks some involving questions too bad it doesnt give enough depth side characters or subplots we dont really care about mystery because we dont know enough about suspects movie does conclude with twist but it doesnt encourage another examination movie it lacks foundation altogether story spends so much time foreshadowing villains identity it is pointless story abandon its proceeding plot points develop new villain at end book gets away with this movie does not after his gentle home alone sweet natured stepmom many questioned ability director chris columbus bring sense darkness story good reason harry potter contains charming likable characters rich pallet lush inventive images unfortunately film lacks edge its missing dark atmosphere rowlings novel so vividly brought life columbus does construct some memorable sequences but individual scenes themselves are much better than movie as whole despite its childish story pre teen characters many define harry potter as film all ages while thats debatable during my screening adults were plowing through isles every five minutes going bathroom getting drink refills buying concessions who knows but not single child budged their seat their eyes were glued big screen conclusion its sure fire experience children especially if theyve read books but adults may not encounter same enticement as kids then again if i had nothing better do than count people leaving theater why am i recommending film,0.49204937126365694,0.1587957637600495,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8.0,What a Brilliantly Fun Way to Begin a Monumental Franchise,"If for nothing else, the Harry Potter films always find a way to give me a great sense of nostalgia. I, like many others, grew up with this franchise. In many ways, this was our generation's Star Wars. It was the 2000's pop culture phenomena. I'm happy to say that the first film, The Sorcerer's Stone, still undoubtedly holds up.I feel like I should first mention just how impressive it is that Warner Bros and their casting directors found the perfect Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Yes, the rest of the film is also impeccably casted with Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, and Tom Felton just to mention a few, but it's the core three characters that carry this franchise. Watching the three of them play off each other so effectively at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring.Granted, heroes are only as good as their villains, and luckily they have a great one in Lord Voldemort. Even though in Sorcerer's Stone it's hard to really call him in the big-bad, considering he's not resurrected yet, but his presence is definitely felt. With that said, I wish they would have involved Professor Quirrell more in the main plot. He's a sketchy guy, but you never get a real sense that he's working to resurrect Voldemort. In fact, he's barely in the movie, so his presence towards the end is unexpected, but I didn't feel like it was earned.But the mishandling of the villain doesn't diminish the tremendous amount of fun The Sorcerer's Stone brings to the young franchise. Chris Columbus does a nice job of setting up all the relationships and characters we will come to love later like Hagrid, Dumbledore, and even Snape. This is clearly focused on the trio, but they each get a chance to chew up some scenery with the young wizards. Everything from a clumsy giant, the dark forest, a game of quidditch, to an important game of chess make The Sorcerer's Stone one of the most memorable entries into the Potter franchise. +The trio are effortlessly cute and entertaining+Pacing+All the beloved characters sprinkled in+Balances a bunch of genres in one-Villain reveal is iffy8.4/10",what brilliantly fun way begin monumental franchise,if nothing else harry potter films always find way give me great sense nostalgia i like many others grew up with this franchise many ways this was our generations star wars it was 2000s pop culture phenomena im happy say that first film sorcerers stone still undoubtedly holds up i feel like i should first mention just how impressive it is that warner bros their casting directors found perfect harry ron hermione yes rest film is also impeccably casted with maggie smith richard harris robbie coltrane tom felton just mention few but its core three characters that carry this franchise watching three them play off each other so effectively at such young age is truly awe inspiring granted heroes are only as good as their villains luckily they have great one lord voldemort even though sorcerers stone its hard really call him big bad considering hes not resurrected yet but his presence is definitely felt with that said i wish they would have involved professor quirrell more main plot hes sketchy guy but you never get real sense that hes working resurrect voldemort fact hes barely movie so his presence towards end is unexpected but i didnt feel like it was earned but mishandling villain doesnt diminish tremendous amount fun sorcerers stone brings young franchise chris columbus does nice job setting up all relationships characters we will come love later like hagrid dumbledore even snape this is clearly focused trio but they each get chance chew up some scenery with young wizards everything clumsy giant dark forest game quidditch important game chess make sorcerers stone one most memorable entries into potter franchise trio are effortlessly cute entertaining pacing all beloved characters sprinkled balances bunch genres one villain reveal is iffy8 4 10,0.5822916666666664,0.2576388888888888,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,...Welcome to magic world,"The breeze stirred the neatly cut bushes of Tisovaya Street, silently lying under the ink-black sky. Of all the streets in the world, this street was the least suitable for amazing events. Harry Potter turned in his sleep. A small hand groped for it and squeezed the envelope. The boy was asleep ... ""(c)June 30, 1997 in the light came the debut of the writer Joan Kathleen Rowling. Literally such words began to become great, a series about a small wizard, with a scar on his forehead. The story that absorbed the minds of adolescents around the world, as it was said in the press ""... a book that can tear boys and girls away from TVs and computers, return it to the house from the street ...""Just imagine...""A dull, dank, dark night. In the street a storm. The little boy lies on the floor of his ""room"", in a small shack and draws a finger in the sand with an inscription, ""Happy Birthday, Harry!"". The cry of the soul, he knows that no one will congratulate him, no one will affably caress the top of his head. In a minute he will be eleven. Ten seconds ... Nine ... You can wake Dudley - just for laughing ... Three ... Two ... One ... A loud knock at the door, there's no knock, just a crash. There was someone behind the door, and he was obviously going to come in. ""I think anyone will guess what happened next. Good-natured giant Hagrid, told Harry the striking news that he is not just a boy with a scar on his forehead, but a real magician.A short word about the actors.HarryWhat to say, there would not be Harry James Potter, there would not be the book itself. Whatever happens in the books, I was always entirely for his character. In the first part, he's just small, you can even tell a confused boy. All situations, difficult fights, intricate situations, are still ahead. Now he just scooped up this great knowledge - magic. The first real home, first friends, first classes, the first meeting with this evil, he is experiencing all this in the first part. HermioneHermione Jane Granger is my favorite female character in the book and film. In it, I see a part of myself. Hermione loves to learn and she pays a lot of time. Sometimes she is too arrogant and excessively proud of her success in her studies. Born of a muggle, so often heard the offensive word ""Mudblood"" in her address. Hermione is just a smart girl, how many times she has yet to pull friends out of difficult situations.RonRonald Bilius Weasley. Redhead. Already this word can give some characteristic. Ron is the sixth child in a wealthy family of hereditary magicians. Always the elders took on everything superior to Ron, be it study, sport, or female attention. Arriving at Hogwarts, gets to know Harry, the same situation is repeated as with the brothers, but he reconciles with his second plan. Whatever it is, he remains the best friend of Harry and Hermione.I wanted to say that the whole trio was exactly the same as it was represented by millions of readers in the world. Actors took absolutely unknown, but this film made them real little stars.The movie has good enough, more famous actors, the same Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and the inimitable Richard Harris. His death was just a blow to all the fans, his Dumbledore seemed to come off the pages of the book, the same wise look from under the half-glasses, gray hair and beard, hooked nose. He inspired a kind of majestic calmness, every appearance on the screen calming. By the way, I do not consider Michael Gambon a good Dumbledore, he turned out to be some kind of crazy, but this is not on this topic. It is quite possible to write now a complete retelling of the book / movie, but you know, absolutely do not want to. Joan Rowling created an amazing, magical world, thanks to her, millions of boys and girls began to look for a scar on their foreheads and with impatience and hope to wait for their 11th birthday. And I'm certainly happy about how Chris Columbus embodied this idea on the screen, the fairy tale turned out to be absolutely childish, very bright, joyful and for some reason the word Christmas comes to mind, although there is not so much Christmas there.Children's dream came true. Harry found his friends, his family, found loyal defenders, but he does not even suspect what he will have in the future. However, it will not be soon, but now enjoy watching!Dedicated to: all those who are ready to go with Harry to the end.",welcome magic world,breeze stirred neatly cut bushes tisovaya street silently lying under ink black sky all streets world this street was least suitable amazing events harry potter turned his sleep small hand groped it squeezed envelope boy was asleep c june 30 1997 light came debut writer joan kathleen rowling literally such words began become great series about small wizard with scar his forehead story that absorbed minds adolescents around world as it was said press book that can tear boys girls away tvs computers return it house street just imagine dull dank dark night street storm little boy lies floor his room small shack draws finger sand with inscription happy birthday harry cry soul he knows that no one will congratulate him no one will affably caress top his head minute he will be eleven ten seconds nine you can wake dudley just laughing three two one loud knock at door theres no knock just crash there was someone behind door he was obviously going come i think anyone will guess what happened next good natured giant hagrid told harry striking news that he is not just boy with scar his forehead but real magician short word about actors harrywhat say there would not be harry james potter there would not be book itself whatever happens books i was always entirely his character first part hes just small you can even tell confused boy all situations difficult fights intricate situations are still ahead now he just scooped up this great knowledge magic first real home first friends first classes first meeting with this evil he is experiencing all this first part hermionehermione jane granger is my favorite female character book film it i see part myself hermione loves learn she pays lot time sometimes she is too arrogant excessively proud her success her studies born muggle so often heard offensive word mudblood her address hermione is just smart girl how many times she has yet pull friends out difficult situations ronronald bilius weasley redhead already this word can give some characteristic ron is sixth child wealthy family hereditary magicians always elders took everything superior ron be it study sport or female attention arriving at hogwarts gets know harry same situation is repeated as with brothers but he reconciles with his second plan whatever it is he remains best friend harry hermione i wanted say that whole trio was exactly same as it was represented by millions readers world actors took absolutely unknown but this film made them real little stars movie has good enough more famous actors same maggie smith alan rickman robbie coltrane julie walters inimitable richard harris his death was just blow all fans his dumbledore seemed come off pages book same wise look under half glasses gray hair beard hooked nose he inspired kind majestic calmness every appearance screen calming by way i do not consider michael gambon good dumbledore he turned out be some kind crazy but this is not this topic it is quite possible write now complete retelling book movie but you know absolutely do not want joan rowling created amazing magical world thanks her millions boys girls began look scar their foreheads with impatience hope wait their 11th birthday im certainly happy about how chris columbus embodied this idea screen fairy tale turned out be absolutely childish very bright joyful some reason word christmas comes mind although there is not so much christmas there childrens dream came true harry found his friends his family found loyal defenders but he does not even suspect what he will have future however it will not be soon but now enjoy watching dedicated all those who are ready go with harry end,0.5817549491706793,0.1994067683253076,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.23}"

My friends want to see the new Harry Potter that is about to be released this summer, The Order of Phoenix, but they looked at my like I just lost my head when I told them I never saw the Harry Potter films. They just said I've seen every movie yet I never saw Harry Potter? Well, I never saw the point since I don't read the books or wasn't interested in the films, it looked like typical kid's stuff to me. But my friends said they would not take me to see the movie until I've seen the films, it's now that I realize I got myself into trouble since these movies are all 2+ hours each. I just finished the first one a couple days ago.Harry Potter lives with an extremely cruel family, but there is something different about him, he can talk to snakes and make things appear and disappear. Well, he receives a letter, he's a wizard! Not just any wizard, he is the only wizard ever to survive the wrath of Voldemort, the most wicked wizard. Harry goes to a magical school, Hogwarts, where he learns the truth of his heroic parents and meets two other wizards, Ron and Hermione who soon become his best friends and they discover the power of the sorcerer's stone and what might happen if it's put into the wrong hands.Harry Potter I have to admit is off to a good start with me, it had wonderful and magical effects that anyone could enjoy. The actors were just so perfectly cast, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Cleese, we have some of England's most brilliant actors. It's a well made film, now I still haven't read the books, so I can't base this film on a comparison. Even if I did, this is the movie and the movie itself is a magical and enchanting experience.

7.0,Gem of a children's film and a fine adaptation of the Rowling novel,"Over-hyped but still enjoyable ""event"" movie, one of the biggest of 2001 until LORD OF THE RINGS comes out, and a film in which every million of the budget is put up on screen in the special effects. What I found most refreshing about this blockbuster is that the entire cast is made up of British actors and actresses! It makes a change for an expensive blockbuster movie to be thus but there you go, HARRY POTTER is indeed a unique movie. Now I'm not one of those people with lots of time on their hands to read the never-ending Harry Potter books (too busy watching cult movies I'm afraid), but the film has turned out pretty much as I would have expected from the adverts. Although it's overly sentimental (blame it on director Chris Columbus) and aimed at children, adults can still enjoy it for the excellent pacing (rarely does the two-and-a-half hour running time drag) and the plethora of special - and some not so special - effects on view throughout.Highlights include an attack in the school's toilets by a huge, lumbering troll, a life size game of chess in which the pieces come to life to destroy each other, a cloak of invisibility, a man with two faces on opposite sides of his head, and the finale which includes a scene of a man disintegrating into dust as a homage to Hammer's Dracula and is just as impressive. The CGI effects are elaborate and generally flawless, and the only ones I didn't care for were the ""broomstick flying"" shots in the quidditch game which still ended up looking a little too fake for my liking, which is a shame as they're used excessively. Otherwise the effects work is phenomenal and something to be seen.Daniel Radcliffe takes on the rather subdued role of Potter, and is overshadowed by two excellent performances from Rupert Grint as the lovably cheeky Ron and Emma Watson as the bossy Hermione. The supporting cast are generally excellent, with fine turns from Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore, Robbie Coltrane as the giant Hagrid (whose weight bizarrely fluctuates throughout the movie), John Cleese - briefly - as an unsuccessful ghost, Nearly Headless Nick, John Hurt as a wand dealer, Richard Griffiths as Harry's unpleasant uncle, and most of all Alan Rickman with a sinisterly villainous performance of Gothic dread - nobody can be a bad guy like Rickman can. Cameos from the likes of Julie Walters, Fiona Shaw, Zoe Wanamaker, and even Warwick Davis (which surely had to be a step up from LEPRECHAUN 5 or whatever his last film was) as a goblin are endless and a delight.HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE may be a kid's film, but there's enough going on here to make it an enjoyable viewing experience for adults who plan to watch the film with their kids as well. Lots of plot, interesting and original characters, refreshingly old-fashioned moral codes, some fine sets which skilfully mix old and new-style worlds, an effective score, special effects which seamlessly blend in with the story and above average acting help to make this a gem of a movie and a cut above the rest.",gem childrens film fine adaptation rowling novel,over hyped but still enjoyable event movie one biggest 2001 until lord rings comes out film which every million budget is put up screen special effects what i found most refreshing about this blockbuster is that entire cast is made up british actors actresses it makes change expensive blockbuster movie be thus but there you go harry potter is indeed unique movie now im not one those people with lots time their hands read never ending harry potter books too busy watching cult movies im afraid but film has turned out pretty much as i would have expected adverts although its overly sentimental blame it director chris columbus aimed at children adults can still enjoy it excellent pacing rarely does two half hour running time drag plethora special some not so special effects view throughout highlights include attack schools toilets by huge lumbering troll life size game chess which pieces come life destroy each other cloak invisibility man with two faces opposite sides his head finale which includes scene man disintegrating into dust as homage hammers dracula is just as impressive cgi effects are elaborate generally flawless only ones i didnt care were broomstick flying shots quidditch game which still ended up looking little too fake my liking which is shame as theyre used excessively otherwise effects work is phenomenal something be seen daniel radcliffe takes rather subdued role potter is overshadowed by two excellent performances rupert grint as lovably cheeky ron emma watson as bossy hermione supporting cast are generally excellent with fine turns richard harris as headmaster dumbledore robbie coltrane as giant hagrid whose weight bizarrely fluctuates throughout movie john cleese briefly as unsuccessful ghost nearly headless nick john hurt as wand dealer richard griffiths as harrys unpleasant uncle most all alan rickman with sinisterly villainous performance gothic dread nobody can be bad guy like rickman can cameos likes julie walters fiona shaw zoe wanamaker even warwick davis which surely had be step up leprechaun 5 or whatever his last film was as goblin are endless delight harry potter philosophers stone may be kids film but theres enough going here make it enjoyable viewing experience adults who plan watch film with their kids as well lots plot interesting original characters refreshingly old fashioned moral codes some fine sets which skilfully mix old new style worlds effective score special effects which seamlessly blend with story above average acting help make this gem movie cut above rest,0.5674016955266956,0.16118777056277053,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7.0,Nice beginning to an amazing saga,"The right way to start a saga like this one, introducing the characters in a very positive and unique way, telling and showcasing all the riches that the wizard's world is a home of. In only one movie, we've seen amazing creatures, friendly and foes, teachers that are heroes and villains, we've witnessed the wisdom of the legendary professor Dumbldor, the movie made us guess who will be who and on who's side in the chapters to come and above all, we had fun. I will never forget the part where Harry buys all the things he needs to start his wizard journey, the authentic look of the streets, the shops and the bank will be part of the Harry Potter legacy forever.",nice beginning amazing saga,right way start saga like this one introducing characters very positive unique way telling showcasing all riches that wizards world is home only one movie weve seen amazing creatures friendly foes teachers that are heroes villains weve witnessed wisdom legendary professor dumbldor movie made us guess who will be who whos side chapters come above all we had fun i will never forget part where harry buys all things he needs start his wizard journey authentic look streets shops bank will be part harry potter legacy forever,0.7162337662337661,0.4109307359307359,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,As good an adaption as could ever be expected,"To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director's nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected.

8.0,"Valiant, successful attempt to bring the magic to life","We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least.
