1.0,I am pretty sure the American Atheists must have actually made this film!,"While I am sure that many Christians will think that this film was savaged because they are all haters, the fact is that ""Saving Christmas"" is an incredibly bad film. Christians and non-Christians alike will most likely find it tedious--like a lecture by a boring professor that goes on and on and on and on. It lacks the structure or style to make it interesting or even a movie. Instead, it mostly consists of Kirk Cameron lecturing and lecturing and lecturing and who wants to go to see a film or pay for a DVD like this?! On top of that, so much of the film was just badly made...such as the insufferable opening song, the illogical 'truths' in the film (such as the myth about swadling clothes and how they are the same as burial cloths--which they AREN'T), the poor acting and overall dullness of the movie. This film isn't even bad in a fun way like BIRDEMIC or THE ROOM or PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Instead, it's just ponderous and preachy-- things no one wants from a movie.

1.0,A yuletide atrocity,"It's no secret that, on both the mainstream and independent circuit of film, Christian cinema has been a big focus in 2014. Films like ""Heaven is for Real,"" ""Noah,"" ""Son of God,"" and next month's ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" have all catered to the faithful in some way and have gone on to achieve uniformly strong financial numbers as well. The independent circuit has seen big hits like ""God's Not Dead"" and marginal successes like ""Left Behind,"" ""Mom's Night Out,"" ""Persecuted,"" and ""When the Game Stands Tall,"" all of which finding ways to connect with their target audience in at least recognizing their faith in the cinema, a place where it's fair to believe the religious demographic has felt ignored. Former Television star and devout, outspoken Christian Kirk Cameron has now thrown his hat in the ring, latching on to this newfound trend, and effectively making not only the worst film of its genre but the worst film of 2014. ""Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas"" is a disjointed mess, structurally pathetic and morally bankrupt as we watch scenes interwoven with little coherency, dialog written and delivered in its most wooden form, and wonderful morals to teach our children, like ""materialism is good."" The film begins with Cameron sitting in a blatantly artificial living room, decorated with more Christmas lights and flair than Macy's after Thanksgiving passes, giving us an introduction to the film at hand. He states the biggest problem with the Christmas season is the ""people"" who want to segregate the spread of faith and good cheer to the private homes of those who celebrate the holiday or simply want the holiday done away with all together. He rambles on for about three minutes as the introduction sets the perfect theme for this film; it's a circumventing project that never results in a specific or thoughtfully-articulated point.We cut to a Christmas party held by Cameron's sister, where a Santa has been hired, the tree has been erected, the house has been decorated, a feast has been prepared, and everyone is in an incorruptibly cheery mood; everyone except Cameron's brother-in-law Christian (director Darren Doane), who is seen moping around the house before quietly slipping away to his car. Kirk follows Christian and learns the materialism of Christmas bothers him immensely, as he watches kids beg for toys they won't play with in three weeks and parents max out their credit cards, giving way to the materials and the illuminating tree in the center of the room, and all while neglecting the baby Jesus in the manger, who is the ultimate ""reason for the season.""Cameron begins to initiate flashbacks to biblical times to ""justify"" why we have the Christmas traditions that we do. However, it's not enough that we get a history lesson told from the enormously biased lens of Cameron, but in a dodgy and muddled manner. Cameron gets absorbed in the significance of baby Jesus's swaddling cloth and the original mean-spirited roots of Saint Nicholas (something that will undoubtedly scare and confuse children), never addressing Christian's true distaste for the holiday season. Kirk meanders for about forty minutes, talking himself in incoherent and redundant circles, never addressing Christian's questions in a way that we can extract counterpoints or citing Christmas's Pagan and cultist roots (if you're going to show Saint Nicholas as a brute, at least address the backstory).Interjected in these ridiculously dry biblical flashbacks and in-car dialogs are exaggerated characters masquerading as likable people with personalities drawn so wide they are desperately unfunny. We see two party guests discuss ""The War on Christmas,"" relating it to several other conspiracy theories that just feels like a soundoff of paranoia. We get a few minutes of dead-end, annoying conversation and some of the worst displays of acting this year before it's back to the car for a half-assed lecture. ""Saving Christmas"" ends with an abhorrent dance number to an incorrigible techno/rap hybrid, with members of the cast obnoxiously dancing and doing slow-motion choreography together. We end things with a perfunctory voice-over with Cameron before we're greeted by almost ten minutes of closing credits showing bloopers, outtakes, and a barrage of other things padding this project to just barely being feature- length (eighty minutes). If my plot synopsis sounds like it has not made any sense, then I have effectively lived up to the structure and the narrative pace of this particular film.Just by comparing the full-length film to its trailer, you can tell ""Saving Christmas"" was Cameron's last minute idea to cash in on the Christian cinema craze of the year. The trailer for the film talks about how Christmas has been corrupted by materialism and the political correctness of the holiday. However, Cameron blatantly contradicts his thesis when he states during the closing monologue that ""materialism is good"" because Christmas is about ""God taking possession of a material body."" Aside from ushering in a pathetic excuse for a moral at the end of a film about Christmas, the cardinal sins committed here run amuck: a sloppy narrative hodgepodge of biblical flashbacks, inept lecturing, and pointless filler clearly padding a small runtime, atrocious acting on all fronts, a desperate attempt at ""staying hip"" and keeping the attention of the audience by throwing in a hip-hop dance number, contemptible morals, and failure to address or even stick to a cogent thesis. Kirk Cameron and company should be required to volunteer at local charities or help cater several breakfasts with Santa to make up for such a yuletide atrocity.",yuletide atrocity,its no secret that

1.0,Every bit as bad as its reputation says,"This movie is so, so utterly wretched, not only in its execution but also in its conception.Just from a filmmaking perspective, it's extremely shoddy. Many portions look like home movies. A large part of the film is Cameron sitting in a car talking to a friend, and that's not interesting to watch. ""Comedy"" scenes have nothing to do with the rest of the story, and are creepily unfunny. A bizarre dance scene at the end is out of place and seems inserted to extend the time. Cameron's presence here is smarmy and smug; he lays out his spiritual views and his friend just gushes about how right Cameron is and how he's helped him see the light and love Christmas and all that. A bigger problem is the misinformation that Cameron spews so authoritatively, some of which runs counter to the Bible and to known history. To give a partial list:Cameron claims that Joseph and Mary were hiding from soldiers sent by Herod to kill all babies being born. But the Gospel of Matthew says the soldiers were sent by Herod AFTER Jesus was born, when Herod was tipped off by the visiting Wise Men that a King of the Jews had been born. Joseph and Mary then took Jesus and did the Flight into Egypt to save the child's life.Cameron insists the Nativity took place in a cave because the manger was made of stone. No source claims the manger was stone, or that the Nativity took place in a cave. Matthew says it was in Joseph's house in Bethlehem, Luke says it was a stable. This seems like a post-hoc attempt to link the Nativity with the Resurrection.Cameron says frankincense and myrrh were ""funeral spices."" Although myrrh had been used in Egyptian mummification, frankincense was not, and both were much more commonly used as a sacred incense in Hebrew temples.He goes into detail about Saint Nicholas' life, presenting it as fact, but in truth very little is known for sure about him, and some Christian leaders openly suggest that he may never have existed. All that is known for sure is that someone named Nicholas was at one point the Bishop of Myra; everything else is unsure and in the territory of legend and myth.Legend has it that during the Council of Nicaea, Nicholas angrily struck Arius in the face for saying that Jesus and God were separate. Cameron depicts Nicholas savagely and brutally attacking Arius and beating him with a shepherd's crook, a scene many Christians found objectionable.Cameron depicts the historical Saint Nicholas climbing on a sleigh to deliver presents to children, something he never did in any legend. He also claims that Saint Nicholas is the gift-giver everywhere, also not supported by history. Some areas give gifts on Christmas, others at Epiphany, others on St. Nicholas' day, and in some areas the gifts are delivered by someone else entirely, such as La Befana in Italy, St. Basil in Greece, the Yule Lads in Iceland, St. Lucy in Croatia, and multiple countries have the gifts delivered by the Magi, angels, or the Christ Child himself. Cameron says Nicholas was ""sainted,"" when in reality Nicholas was never canonized. His sainthood was more by word-of-mouth.Cameron makes an elaborate rationalization for Christmas trees relating to the crucifixion and to the Garden of Eden; this connection is very convoluted and labored, and doesn't hold water. And he doesn't address the parts of Jeremiah which some feel are a commandment against Christmas trees.He claims that gifts piled under the Christmas tree are perfectly acceptable as they are reminiscent of the skyline of Jerusalem. By that reasoning, they could also be the skyline of Babylon or Rome, and could represent oppression and slavery. It's a poorly considered analogy that should never have been included.I'm sure I'm missing other bits, but I'm not inclined to go back and watch it again. It's unsettling to see Cameron stand and claim that it's OK to be materialistic at Christmas, because that's when God came to the Earth in material form. (That's pretty much a direct quote.) Never mind the many passages where the Bible tells us to set aside worldly things and not be materialistic! He exhorts viewers to eat themselves to bursting and buy the biggest ham and the richest butter....but isn't gluttony considered a deadly sin?At no point does he address such issues as helping the poor, feeding the hungry, giving to charity, volunteering, or anything. One is left with the impression that one should only think of one's self and one's immediate family and friends. Does Cameron remember Jesus' command to his followers to give away all they had to the poor? Somehow, I don't think so.Cameron gives the impression of someone who read parts of the Bible long ago, but rather than fit his life to the Bible, he is fitting the Bible to the life he wants to lead, and making one justification after another without ever bothering to double-check if he's remembering it correctly, or if there's something in the Bible that disagrees with him. It's clear he considers himself a better Christian than you. Many of the faithful have been turned off by this movie, some even going so far as to declare it blasphemous and call Cameron a false prophet. I'm not so sure I would agree, but at the same time, this movie does have some value of showing how even a faithful Christian can fall victim to the sins of pride and arrogance. It's clear that Cameron's ego was in overdrive, and this movie is not as much a testament to God as it is an expression of Cameron's arrogance.",every bit as bad as its reputation says,this movie is so so utterly wretched not only its execution but also its conception just filmmaking perspective its extremely shoddy many portions look like home movies large part film is cameron sitting car talking friend thats not interesting watch comedy scenes have nothing do with rest story are creepily unfunny bizarre dance scene at end is out place seems inserted extend time camerons presence here is smarmy smug he lays out his spiritual views his friend just gushes about how right cameron is how hes helped him see light love christmas all that bigger problem is misinformation that cameron spews so authoritatively some which runs counter bible known history give partial list cameron claims that joseph mary were hiding soldiers sent by herod kill all babies being born but gospel matthew says soldiers were sent by herod after jesus was born when herod was tipped off by visiting wise men that king jews had been born joseph mary then took jesus did flight into egypt save childs life cameron insists nativity took place cave because manger was made stone no source claims manger was stone or that nativity took place cave matthew says it was josephs house bethlehem luke says it was stable this seems like post hoc attempt link nativity with resurrection cameron says frankincense myrrh were funeral spices although myrrh had been used egyptian mummification frankincense was not both were much more commonly used as sacred incense hebrew temples he goes into detail about saint nicholas life presenting it as fact but truth very little is known sure about him some christian leaders openly suggest that he may never have existed all that is known sure is that someone named nicholas was at one point bishop myra everything else is unsure territory legend myth legend has it that during council nicaea nicholas angrily struck arius face saying that jesus god were separate cameron depicts nicholas savagely brutally attacking arius beating him with shepherds crook scene many christians found objectionable cameron depicts historical saint nicholas climbing sleigh deliver presents children something he never did any legend he also claims that saint nicholas is gift giver everywhere also not supported by history some areas give gifts christmas others at epiphany others st nicholas day some areas gifts are delivered by someone else entirely such as la befana italy st basil greece yule lads iceland st lucy croatia multiple countries have gifts delivered by magi angels or christ child himself cameron says nicholas was sainted when reality nicholas was never canonized his sainthood was more by word mouth cameron makes elaborate rationalization christmas trees relating crucifixion garden eden this connection is very convoluted labored doesnt hold water he doesnt address parts jeremiah which some feel are commandment against christmas trees he claims that gifts piled under christmas tree are perfectly acceptable as they are reminiscent skyline jerusalem by that reasoning they could also be skyline babylon or rome could represent oppression slavery its poorly considered analogy that should never have been included im sure im missing other bits but im not inclined go back watch it again its unsettling see cameron stand claim that its ok be materialistic at christmas because thats when god came earth material form thats pretty much direct quote never mind many passages where bible tells us set aside worldly things not be materialistic he exhorts viewers eat themselves bursting buy biggest ham richest butter but isnt gluttony considered deadly sin at no point does he address such issues as helping poor feeding hungry giving charity volunteering or anything one is left with impression that one should only think ones self ones immediate family friends does cameron remember jesus command his followers give away all they had poor somehow i dont think so cameron gives impression someone who read parts bible long ago but rather than fit his life bible he is fitting bible life he wants lead making one justification after another without ever bothering double check if hes remembering it correctly or if theres something bible that disagrees with him its clear he considers himself better christian than you many faithful have been turned off by this movie some even going so far as declare it blasphemous call cameron false prophet im not so sure i would agree but at same time this movie does have some value showing how even faithful christian can fall victim sins pride arrogance its clear that camerons ego was overdrive this movie is not as much testament god as it is expression camerons arrogance,0.5167133520074697,0.08722426470588235,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,St Nicholas gonna open up a can o' whup ass!,"After seeing all the negative reviews of this film, I had to check it out. I heard about Kirk Cameron's up voting campaign on Rotten Tomatoes and the ensuing backlash from atheists and so on. But I wanted to see if the film was really that bad. It is. It's really awful, probably the most awkward, uncomfortable hour of my life. Troll 2 was funny on a So-bad-it's-good level, so was The Room. But this is just painfully bad. This film aggravates me on so many levels. But I want to leave out the B.S religious side of it, there's more than enough reviews, even from Christians, attacking this film for it's head scratching Evangelical nonsense. Instead, I'd like to focus on an aspect of the film that I feel has been overlooked, the historical ""facts"" that Cameron pulls out of his arse. I'm a history buff, and this film made me so angry. Cameron expects us to believe that St. Nicholas got so angry with Arius that he dragged him out into the snow and beat the crap out of him with a staff! He did no such thing. As one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed, St. Nicholas got into an argument concerning the divinity of Christ and punched the Christian presbyter in the face. Then there's the barking mad argument about the pagan roots of Christianity which Cameron dismisses, claiming that everything was created by God and therefore everything to do with Christmas can be traced back to God, even the Nutcracker! And on it goes... The arguments make no sense, the acting is horribly stilted and the 'comedy' is painfully bad. It's such an incoherent, rambling mess from ""Crocoduck"" Cameron that by the time he's dancing and doing the worm, you just have no idea what you're watching any more.

1.0,Abhorrent in every way,"Every Christmas season one can count on the fact that we will be inundated with TV shows recycling the It's A Wonderful Life story, Hallmark Channel will overwhelm us with treacle, and a spate of Christmas-themed films will multiply at the cineplex to raise holiday spirits. I give extremist Christian Kirk Cameron dubious credit for crafting a Christmas-themed film that actually seems to be completely clueless about the meaning of Christmas.It goes without saying that the film resembles a glorified home movie, with horrible writing, worse acting and horrendous production values. Most of the film functions as little more than an unwieldy frame for Cameron to lecture at the audience using the most spurious of ""facts"" and a dubious re-writing of history.The basic ""story"" opens at a family Christmas party where Kirk's brother-in-law, Christian (oh the irony!) is all rather overwhelmed and depressed by the materialism of the holiday and feels that the true meaning of Christmas has been lost. This ""attitude"" apparently irritates everyone else, and so Kirk follows Christian to his car to harangue him on his misguided foolishness for the extraordinarily padded 80 minutes running time. Most of this has the camera focused on Cameron's perpetually smug smirk while he relentlessly lectures his hapless brother-in-law with outright lies, heavily abridged stories, and general all-around shaming. Interspersed to pad the running time, we take some brief breaks back into the house where completely ridiculous one-note flamboyant caricatures indulge in laughable conversations that no one you know not in a padded cell will ever have with you in your lifetime. The pathetic point though is that during Cameron's often incoherent and misleading ramblings, he never once truly addresses any of the issues that Christian had about the materialism of the modern celebrations. Nevertheless, Kirk's relentless verbal diarrhea utterly astounds Christian and makes him ""see the light"" and he returns to the party to beg the forgiveness of everyone there for negatively impacting their celebration.Then, Kirk launches into yet another lecture where he urges us to buy the biggest tree, get the richest butter, and max out the credit cards because this is all a part of Christmas and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I myself was raised a Christian and I can assure you that if anyone were to parrot this thought back to any of my religion teachers, their mouth would be washed out with soap. It is a perfectly despicable moral and abysmal coda to an already dreadful ""holiday"" film, which does the unthinkable of surpassing Christmas with the Kranks and Jingle All the Way as the most morally jaded holiday film in history. The film also includes a relentless unfunny blooper reel AND a dance sequence that must be seen to be believed...or better yet don't see it at all.",abhorrent every way,every christmas season one can count fact that we will be inundated with tv shows recycling its wonderful life story hallmark channel will overwhelm us with treacle spate christmas themed films will multiply at cineplex raise holiday spirits i give extremist christian kirk cameron dubious credit crafting christmas themed film that actually seems be completely clueless about meaning christmas it goes without saying that film resembles glorified home movie with horrible writing worse acting horrendous production values most film functions as little more than unwieldy frame cameron lecture at audience using most spurious facts dubious re writing history basic story opens at family christmas party where kirks brother law christian oh irony is all rather overwhelmed depressed by materialism holiday feels that true meaning christmas has been lost this attitude apparently irritates everyone else so kirk follows christian his car harangue him his misguided foolishness extraordinarily padded 80 minutes running time most this has camera focused camerons perpetually smug smirk while he relentlessly lectures his hapless brother law with outright lies heavily abridged stories general all around shaming interspersed pad running time we take some brief breaks back into house where completely ridiculous one note flamboyant caricatures indulge laughable conversations that no one you know not padded cell will ever have with you your lifetime pathetic point though is that during camerons often incoherent misleading ramblings he never once truly addresses any issues that christian had about materialism modern celebrations nevertheless kirks relentless verbal diarrhea utterly astounds christian makes him see light he returns party beg forgiveness everyone there negatively impacting their celebration then kirk launches into yet another lecture where he urges us buy biggest tree get richest butter max out credit cards because this is all part christmas dont let anyone tell you otherwise i myself was raised christian i can assure you that if anyone were parrot this thought back any my religion teachers their mouth would be washed out with soap it is perfectly despicable moral abysmal coda already dreadful holiday film which does unthinkable surpassing christmas with kranks jingle all way as most morally jaded holiday film history film also includes relentless unfunny blooper reel dance sequence that must be seen be believed or better yet dont see it at all,0.465,0.005833333333333337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1.0,"Notice how long the 10-star raters have been members, and how many movies they've reviewed...","First, let me state that in spite of the claims of Cameron and those who support him (and who have attempted to artificially raise this movie's ratings with fake profiles and fake reviews), I, as someone who hated this movie, have nothing against Christians or Christianity. Not at all. Most everyone I know and love _are_ Christians. Die-hard, conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Fox-news-loving fundamentalist Christians. And even THEY thought this movie sucked.That Kirk tried to use religious guilt on people to have the ratings artificially inflated is just pathetic. Seriously, dude, you have a problem. You need help. Get some. :-/ My opinion of this movie is pretty much the same as the opinions of EVERYONE I know who's actually had the misfortune of deciding to give it a try. It would be pure camp if those who made it weren't being so stone-faced serious. It's patronizing, condescending, childish and just downright _bad_. And it's not the message, itself - even those I know who agree with the central point Kirk's trying to make see the movie as doing more harm than good.As for that illicit ratings-inflating campaign, it appears to be bearing fruit. When you have a movie with overwhelmingly bad ratings (and I man REALLY bad, where most are just 1-star with, shall we say, ""Nothing nice to say...""), and just a couple of profiles with 10-star ratings and glowing things to say, and ALL of those 10-star profiles were clearly just set up just to make the glowing review about just that one movie... I'm not going to outright accuse anyone of anything, but, well, it doesn't inspire confidence in their legitimacy.I mean seriously, dude, stop it. You're not helping Christianity's image at all. In fact, you're making it worse. Even if you don't care about your own image, you should seriously give thought to how much more damage you want to do to the Christian image in the U.S. today. Or are you a closet atheist trying to destroy the ""enemy"" from within? Your actions are hurting far more than helping.And I have nothing against Christianity or religion in general. If people want to be proud of their religion and remind themselves of the spin Christianity has added to the meaning of all these previously-existing traditions and holidays, that's wonderful.

1.0,"Should have been called ""Murdering Christmas""","Forget the laughably shoddy production value, the overt preaching, and Kirk Cameron's epic social media temper tantrum when the film was critically panned. All you need to know is that Cameron's message about Christmas is the opposite of what one would expect from a movie called ""Saving Christmas.""See, that whole ""saving Christmas"" storyline has been played out in kids' movies and Hallmark specials over and over again, and it's always about stripping away the commercialism and materialism and getting back into friends and family.Kirk does the exact opposite in this film: He CELEBRATES and ENCOURAGES rabid commercialism. And worst of all, he even attempts to justify his materialism -- his greed and narcissism -- by claiming that's the good proper Christian thing to do.So if not from rabid consumerism, what is Kirk Cameron trying to save Christmas from? From people celebrating, or even acknowledging the existence of, other holidays besides Christmas, from non-Christians celebrating Christmas, and from Christians celebrating Christmas any other way than the way Kirk Cameron believes you should.In short, this is eighty minutes of Kirk Cameron trying to cram one hundred pounds of his self-absorbed discount-salvation bull**** into a one-pound bag, slap ""Christmas Spirit"" on it with a label maker, and hopelessly attempt to cram it down your throat.Unless you are a raving fascist fundamentalist who only hasn't watched this movie because you are afraid of what will happen if you turn your 24/7 Fox News feed off, this movie is guaranteed to make you very angry.

1.0,"Not remotely funny, neither in the right nor wrong sense","I have to admit, that I hadn't even planed to go to the movies on the day that I walked into ""Saving Christmas"". There was nothing on offer that interested me, so I turned to figure another way to squander my money. But then I saw the name ""Kirk Cameron"", saw that pasty face on the poster and two words came to my mind: ""Crockoduck"" and ""Banana""! Yes, through the internet-memes and jokes I had been exposed to Cameron and his ilk. Upon realizing that those people were not comedians, I figured this was the most hilarious insane stuff I had heard in a long time and that Kirk Cameron may well be the missing brother of ""Dumb and Dumber"". So I flashed the buck, walked in and expected much unintentional hilarity and future memes in the making.There were about 10 to 15 people sitting in the cinema, most with kids (I presume they were expecting a Christmas comedy). For a good deal of the beginning we are exposed to Cameron brattling on about some things or other, but it was mainly boring, nonsensical stuff that contained no (unintentional) comedy gold. Only when Kirk spouts that ""god created winter solstice"", there was some chuckling to be heard. Not bad, but heard before (what hasn't god created allegedly? Cars, air, shoes, bacteria, the universe and everything else, etc – this answer will give you a guaranteed A+ in any bible- or koran-school). At this point Cameron is sitting in some car with another guy and, like a true believer he keeps rambling and rambling and rambling. Nodded off for awhile but since I have a light sleep and get easily awoken by noise, I can only deduct that there was no joke missed since nobody had been laughing so far. At what I presume must have been the end of the ""movie"" there was some ridiculous dance-sequence (you know the type that should signify to the audience that they're watching a 'hip' film) and I decided to call it a day. As I turned to leave, I noticed that the cinema was empty and that I was the last rat to leave the sinking ship. So I left Kirk and his friends to dance to an empty cinema – and for all I know, they still dance there as I write.Look, we are all aware that people will believe much if only it gives them a crutch for reality. Virgins giving birth, horses flying from Mekka to Jerusalem overnight, zombies rising from the grave in order to bring world-peace, etc. It would be pointless (and perhaps even unkind) to point out that virgins cannot give birth, horses don't fly and that the dead stay dead. But that's were magic and science clash, alchemy has to make way or chemistry and believe hollers at common-sense and knowledge. Nothing new there, it's been going on since the stone-age. But the stuff that Cameron and his ilk have formulated here (to put it kindly), that's a whole new dimension of crazy. It reeks not only of fanatics but of self-serving. And the worst sin: this movie is boring, tedious and free of laughs, no matter which way you slice it.The lesson learned: it can be mildly amusing to watch a five minute YouTube video about a deranged guy, but giving him 80 minutes of your live, that's simply not a good idea. It's like holding a 'deep' conversation with a bunch of jehova's witness or the guy on the corner with the ""the end is nigh""-sign – what's the point if no real laughs are to be had? Just wait for the internet-meme; if there's something worth laughing about, the ""haters"" will find and post if for sure (and it's free!). ""Jesus Camp"" was funnier (and ""Jesus Camp"" was actually a very sad movie). This here is ""IMDB Bottom-100""-material.Now, enough electronic ink wasted on this. Let's make space for those who found the movie ""exceptional"", ""inspirational"" and ""great education"" – you might be able to guess from which corner those come.What I give this tripe?

1.0,"I'm sorry, but this movie isn't worth saving. Just throw this XMAS film, away! It's not that good of a film.","Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike this movie directed and written by Darren Doane, as much as other critics seem to hate it. I honestly found the endless amounts of dialogue with host Kirk Cameron, somewhat entertaining due to how bat-crazy, his arguments were. Some of it, seem very interesting, like how the film try hard to bridge Christmas tree with that of worshipping Jesus Christ on the cross due to the fact, that they were both made, from wood that came from God. However, that argument isn't that strong as the film makes it out to be, due to the fact, that Cameron seem a bit confused with the biblical tree, he is saying about. After all, the Tree of Life is way different than the Tree of Knowledge. Anyways, most of all of the theories that Cameron was talking about the origins of Christmas were like that. It was bit too strawman and badly research to be taken serious. I really didn't like how Kirk Cameron was trying to convince us that various popular elements of Christmas are more biblical in origin, when it was clearly not. For example, worshipping trees, had its roots in ancient Mesopotamia time, way before, any of the Abrahamic Judaism religions were created. A few of the examples, he brought up, seem a bit unfocused as well. I really don't get, how putting gifts under a tree, is relate to the biblical idea of making New Jerusalem, into a reality. It really doesn't make a lick of sense. Another problem with how this film is how it was market. The poster and trailers imply that the film might be a fun Christmas comedy; like something out of 1989's Christmas Vacation or 1996's Jingle of the Way for Christian families; but in fact, it's an interminable, highly dark and fear-mongering lecture of the bible, masquerading as a jolly good time. Talks about babies and heretic killings, really makes this a bit, too uncomfortable for families to watch. Another problem with the marketing is how the film's trailer acts like it's about stripping away greed from the holiday season and putting Christ back into Christmas. In actuality, the film actively embraces materialism to the point, that it seem to be less about Jesus Christ, and more about defending selfish greedy habits that the holidays season has carry on. I really don't get it, how can this film defend, being selfish and as materialistic as possible, as the true meaning of the holiday. It's a lousy message indeed! I guess, that message shouldn't be, much of a surprised, seeing how this film had a 2.8 million budget, wasted on, mostly filming at an actual expensive Christmas party in 2013. That's another reason why this film, is very unfunny interminable mess. The party was never that interesting, even with the odd hip-hop dance sequence and feasting scenes. Most of the characters there, were very annoying, or just uber-paranoid to care about. The humor that they were trying to pass in these party sequences as comedy really did fall flat. Not only that, but the film was horribly laziness edited, as well. This movie really did go a little too long, with endless amounts of fake endings, but it's not as irritating, as much as the film's too many opening lectures by Kirk Cameron. It takes forever for this film to start. I really didn't like it, because the entire movie, alright boils down to one long conversation in which Cameron, playing himself trying to lighten the mood of a Christmas Grinch of a brother in law, played by Darren Doane in a car. There is no reason for Kirk Cameron, to explain even more. Anyways, any dialogue that didn't seem like a lecture from Cameron, seem a bit overlapping, forced and wooden. I have to say, the acting in this film isn't that god-awful, but it's not even near as decent. Overall: Considering that American faith-based Christmas film has such a negative respond from critics, that even Cameron, himself try to sway backlash, by posting his followers, to give it, a better rating. I have to say, I'm pretty OK, with how this film was mistreated by the majority of the public, and I'm not really an Atheist. This film was indeed lousy. Yes, it might have some 'it's so bad, it's good' moments, that some viewers might find, entertaining, for the most part, I really can't recommended, watching this movie. Unless you're super-religionists, or like, torturing yourself with crappy films.",im sorry but this movie isnt worth saving just throw this xmas film away its not that good film,dont get me wrong i dont dislike this movie directed written by darren doane as much as other critics seem hate it i honestly found endless amounts dialogue with host kirk cameron somewhat entertaining due how bat crazy his arguments were some it seem very interesting like how film try hard bridge christmas tree with that worshipping jesus christ cross due fact that they were both made wood that came god however that argument isnt that strong as film makes it out be due fact that cameron seem bit confused with biblical tree he is saying about after all tree life is way different than tree knowledge anyways most all theories that cameron was talking about origins christmas were like that it was bit too strawman badly research be taken serious i really didnt like how kirk cameron was trying convince us that various popular elements christmas are more biblical origin when it was clearly not example worshipping trees had its roots ancient mesopotamia time way before any abrahamic judaism religions were created few examples he brought up seem bit unfocused as well i really dont get how putting gifts under tree is relate biblical idea making new jerusalem into reality it really doesnt make lick sense another problem with how this film is how it was market poster trailers imply that film might be fun christmas comedy like something out 1989s christmas vacation or 1996s jingle way christian families but fact its interminable highly dark fear mongering lecture bible masquerading as jolly good time talks about babies heretic killings really makes this bit too uncomfortable families watch another problem with marketing is how films trailer acts like its about stripping away greed holiday season putting christ back into christmas actuality film actively embraces materialism point that it seem be less about jesus christ more about defending selfish greedy habits that holidays season has carry i really dont get it how can this film defend being selfish as materialistic as possible as true meaning holiday its lousy message indeed i guess that message shouldnt be much surprised seeing how this film had 2 8 million budget wasted mostly filming at actual expensive christmas party 2013 thats another reason why this film is very unfunny interminable mess party was never that interesting even with odd hip hop dance sequence feasting scenes most characters there were very annoying or just uber paranoid care about humor that they were trying pass these party sequences as comedy really did fall flat not only that but film was horribly laziness edited as well this movie really did go little too long with endless amounts fake endings but its not as irritating as much as films too many opening lectures by kirk cameron it takes forever this film start i really didnt like it because entire movie alright boils down one long conversation which cameron playing himself trying lighten mood christmas grinch brother law played by darren doane car there is no reason kirk cameron explain even more anyways any dialogue that didnt seem like lecture cameron seem bit overlapping forced wooden i have say acting this film isnt that god awful but its not even near as decent overall considering that american faith based christmas film has such negative respond critics that even cameron himself try sway backlash by posting his followers give it better rating i have say im pretty ok with how this film was mistreated by majority public im not really atheist this film was indeed lousy yes it might have some its so bad its good moments that some viewers might find entertaining most part i really cant recommended watching this movie unless youre super religionists or like torturing yourself with crappy films,0.49330035044320764,-0.0016839311482168607,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.24}"

I don't know how we ended up seeing this movie because none of us wanted to see this. The teens didn't want to see some religious movie, my pastor didn't want to see this because she loathes Kirk Cameron, and I didn't want to see it because I wanted to see a good movie. Apparently one of the parents insisted we see a documentary about making Christmas more about Jesus and less about commercialism.Well the jokes on them because shockingly this movie is all about justifying the commercialism of Christmas.I was seriously not expecting that. THis movie throws so much BS at you that it's pretty worrying. It's also really funny. I think I was the only person who enjoyed this movie. I was hoping that Kirk would have a seeing where he's just says insane things like his infamous interview on evolution.This whole movie is insane. I don't think anyone was expecting it to be like this with the random dance scenes, the stereotyped black guy, the stereotypical atheist, and everything else.And now here is an example of Cameron's crazy points about Christmas: -The Christmas tree is not Pagen, it is because Adam and Eve stole from the tree of knowledge and to make up for the original sin, Jesus returned the fruit which was part of man by hanging himself on a cross, which is made of wood which naturally comes from a tree. So trees are really crosses and the Christmas tree is a cross.I did not make that up, that is seriously an argument he makes.And the whole movie is so insane that you have to see it to believe it. I don't think this movie will harm society because I think most Christians who make a big deal about the ""War on Christmas"" will be horrified by this and those who actually buy into it were probably lost causes.

1.0,"Save Yourself, Instead!","How is this even a movie? Even though the actual footage is less than 70 minutes – yet feels like 4 hours – it's more like a 5 minute Sunday School video padded with an incredible amount of slo-mo, a hilariously bad dance sequence, extended hot chocolate promotions and yawn-inducing end-credit goofs to attempt to qualify as a feature film. And though Kirk Cameron's Ego movies are best watched with plenty of alcohol, a drinking game can be created here with the vast number of slowed down shots, Kirk's sister staring off in disbelief, mentions of hot chocolate as if it was a hot lover and actors looking directly at the camera. I guess there's that as a positive.Basically, Kirk Cameron's Ego gets everyone to pitch in a couple of bucks to film in two main locations and attempt to debunk, I guess, a couple of people's anger that Christmas is anything but a reminder of Christ's birthday. A scary lady's husband is being a sourpuss when everyone isn't just shouting ""Jesus is Lord!"" and instead, brutally handing out gifts for Christmas. It takes Kirk Cameron's Ego to give him a laughing bible lesson in a vehicle to bring him back to sliding on floors and scaring people.While this ""movie"" feels like it cost less than twenty bucks to make, it's an extremely simple church lesson that couldn't been summed up tightly in a 5-minute YouTube video. My guess is that Kirk Cameron's Ego wanted to make more money by releasing it into theatres last year. I'll save you the horrifying experience here by paraphrasing what Kirk Cameron's Ego said – and this is one spoiler you won't mind since it will save you these 80 minutes you would've regretted: ""Because it's in the bible in various and random spots: put up a Christmas tree with fruit on it and presents underneath, Santa's okay to visit, Christ rested on a rock with a cloth He won't see again for 33 years and drink plenty of hot chocolate.""Damn, I hope I didn't miss anything.

1.0,"""This cannot be what God wants."" Right!","A question I kept thinking as I somehow went through Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas was 'how is this even a movie?' In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit I didn't go into this expecting it to be very good. That may be a fault on my end, to enter into any movie to do that, but the hype I had heard about this thing - that it was among the craziest pieces of WTF put to screen in the past several years (if ever) - made me too curious to not avoid it. I think also the idea of, frankly, Christian nutter Kirk Cameron going on about the War on Christmas made me wonder if he would make it a screed against those who would denigrate the most sacred of holidays... well, rest assured, it's not that. It's so much wilder than anything you'd hear on FOX News by a pundit. It's a unique specimen in how NOT to make something with a camera and sound equipment and what I guess are sets and maybe some actors(?) and a would-be director-cum-actor-cum-writer. I mean, Jesus this movie...First of all, it's not really a movie, not in the way that we have anything close to compelling characters or dialog together. What we get following an introduction by Cameron (playing himself) where he sips his hot cocoa smugly and bemoans those who don't enjoy Christmas whole-heartedly (smugly in that way that he is constantly smiling and literally preaching to the camera, surrounded by a fireplace and tree and the accouterments of the holiday), is the story of 'Christian' (GET IT?) who seems to be the sad-sod at the holiday party - also Cameron's brother in law - who isn't in the spirit. He is actually depicted harshly, all in voice-over of course (because why show us things when you can TELL us, at length), as someone who looks down on the Christmas holiday and isn't into the 'spirit' of the season. Cut to a Christian sitting in his parked car in the drive-way, and Kirk gets into the passenger seat. This is where the ""meat"" of the movie takes place. Boy howdy.This is a straw-man preach-fest, where Christian, after espousing actually (to me) *reasonable* thoughts about how the money and effort spent on putting up decorations and on presents and so on could be used to help feed the poor and do things that aren't part of actual teachings in the Bible as far as the trappings of the modern holiday goes. Here's where it gets weird: Cameron basically spends the rest of the movie, in really shoddy voice-over over ""scenes"" showing things like what the swaddling cloth the Baby Jesus was covered with and Christmas trees and Santa Claus actual mean and how they're ""REALLY"" connected to the Bible. In other words, it's all deep down justifying why things like the commercialization of the holiday, presents, hot f***ing chocolate, are fine in this time and age. And if the part about the swaddling cloth, and how he makes these connections that just are not there don't make you tear your hair out, the connection with Christmas trees to the *Christ on the Cross* will get you more.One might say that at least Cameron isn't really *mean* with his statements here, and it's certainly not the usual war on Christmas screed. No, the one part you get the latter is in a really jarring and rather unnecessary scene (as if anything here IS necessary to begin with, but even in this context) where it cuts to a scene in the party between two characters - one the (I'm not kidding) token black guy, and the token, uh, conspiracy theorist - and the latter brings up things like Loose Change and Fox News and the war on Christmas like... are we supposed to see him as crazy or a joke or believe him? Aside from being ludicrous (in the best possible way) as this character goes through a monologue with a mug over his mouth so that everything can be ADR'd, it seems so muddled. Is this a joke? What the hell did I just watch? Even if I believed whatever crazy horse-pucky that Cameron spouted here - and to give you an idea of how far out this stuff is, Republican president candidate (and fan of grain-in-the-pyramids theory) Ben Carson gives an endorsement on the DVD cover - the production quality is barely above that of Birdemic. Many shots are just really bizarrely staged (the scene between the two token characters is framed in such a way I want to show it to film school students to see if they know it's correct or not, if they think the former, they're automatically flunking, period). Other times, like the 'recreations' of what Cameron is preaching about in the car, it looks like they didn't have enough money for things like other actors to play the parts - I can't be sure but it looks like Kirk was ""Bad"" Santa in a couple of key shots - and on sets that look like they filmed on a stage in a high school auditorium. Oh, and there's a hip-hop dance sequence that pads out the run-time for what is essentially a LECTURE by Cameron, padded by the token characters and Christian the Straw-Man, and funded by a fundamentalist university.If you watch this and believe this stuff, I feel sorry for you. Go do your own research, see if you can challenge this guy on his claims. But even if everything he said was valid or had some credibility (and it doesn't), the quality of what went into this production makes it easily a contender for among the ten worst films of all time.",this cannot be what god wants right,question i kept thinking as i somehow went through kirk camerons saving christmas was how is this even movie interest full disclosure i have admit i didnt go into this expecting it be very good that may be fault my end enter into any movie do that but hype i had heard about this thing that it was among craziest pieces wtf put screen past several years if ever made me too curious not avoid it i think also idea frankly christian nutter kirk cameron going about war christmas made me wonder if he would make it screed against those who would denigrate most sacred holidays well rest assured its not that its so much wilder than anything youd hear fox news by pundit its unique specimen how not make something with camera sound equipment what i guess are sets maybe some actors would be director cum actor cum writer i mean jesus this movie first all its not really movie not way that we have anything close compelling characters or dialog together what we get following introduction by cameron playing himself where he sips his hot cocoa smugly bemoans those who dont enjoy christmas whole heartedly smugly that way that he is constantly smiling literally preaching camera surrounded by fireplace tree accouterments holiday is story christian get it who seems be sad sod at holiday party also camerons brother law who isnt spirit he is actually depicted harshly all voice over course because why show us things when you can tell us at length as someone who looks down christmas holiday isnt into spirit season cut christian sitting his parked car drive way kirk gets into passenger seat this is where meat movie takes place boy howdy this is straw man preach fest where christian after espousing actually me reasonable thoughts about how money effort spent putting up decorations presents so could be used help feed poor do things that arent part actual teachings bible as far as trappings modern holiday goes heres where it gets weird cameron basically spends rest movie really shoddy voice over over scenes showing things like what swaddling cloth baby jesus was covered with christmas trees santa claus actual mean how theyre really connected bible other words its all deep down justifying why things like commercialization holiday presents hot f ing chocolate are fine this time age if part about swaddling cloth how he makes these connections that just are not there dont make you tear your hair out connection with christmas trees christ cross will get you more one might say that at least cameron isnt really mean with his statements here its certainly not usual war christmas screed no one part you get latter is really jarring rather unnecessary scene as if anything here is necessary begin with but even this context where it cuts scene party between two characters one im not kidding token black guy token uh conspiracy theorist latter brings up things like loose change fox news war christmas like are we supposed see him as crazy or joke or believe him aside being ludicrous best possible way as this character goes through monologue with mug over his mouth so that everything can be adrd it seems so muddled is this joke what hell did i just watch even if i believed whatever crazy horse pucky that cameron spouted here give you idea how far out this stuff is republican president candidate fan grain pyramids theory ben carson gives endorsement dvd cover production quality is barely above that birdemic many shots are just really bizarrely staged scene between two token characters is framed such way i want show it film school students see if they know its correct or not if they think former theyre automatically flunking period other times like recreations what cameron is preaching about car it looks like they didnt have enough money things like other actors play parts i cant be sure but it looks like kirk was bad santa couple key shots sets that look like they filmed stage high school auditorium oh theres hip hop dance sequence that pads out run time what is essentially lecture by cameron padded by token characters christian straw man funded by fundamentalist university if you watch this believe this stuff i feel sorry you go do your own research see if you can challenge this guy his claims but even if everything he said was valid or had some credibility it doesnt quality what went into this production makes it easily contender among ten worst films all time,0.4806063175507619,0.019611276926091752,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,A Fascinating Specimen of Awfulness,"Once in a great while, we as a people are privileged to view a creative art that, is so completely terrible, that it unites our troubled world against it, so that in one brief, glorious moment, we are in agreement. And so is one Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas a ""film"" that was ""written"" and ""directed"" by former Blink-182 music video director Darren Doane, ""starring"" Kirk Cameron as, well, as himself, and his family and friends during his annual Christmas party. At least I suspect that's how this movie was made, Cameron was probably throwing a Christmas party and realized he could make a quick buck, got some cameras, and through this together in under an hour. There is little story to speak of, beyond Cameron preaching to the audience that rampant materialism in the holiday season is OKAY by Jesus was a corporeal being and therefore, material. Intercut within this overlong audience fillbuster are recreations of all the wonderful Christmas imagery we have come to know and love, like the soldiers of King Herod murdering hundreds of babies, and a terrifying-looking Saint Nicholas beating a man to death because he didn't agree with him. Cameron goes to great lengths to explain away holiday traditions like a decorated tree and gifts, but the audience will be far too distracted by the weird bunch-ups in Doane's Christmas sweater, and his weird, pause-filled delivery that will make you think he's some kind of serial killer. And of course, are film ends on a completely random hip-hop dance number that exists only so that Cameron can show us that yes, he can do the worm. This film we leave you scalping yourself because you're scratching your head in bewilderment, trying to comprehend what you've just seen.

1.0,Not feature-length quality,"Full disclosure: I am a Roman Catholic, raised by devout parents and taught by dedicated clergy. I happen to subscribe to the view that the ""war on Christmas"" is part of a larger, not necessarily connected, movement whose chief side effect is to eliminate or diminish the chief underpinnings and foundations of western Judeo-Christian society. Lawsuits against Nativity displays are, to me, the handiwork of unhappy zealots. Having said all that, this film was earnest but profoundly flawed.First, I didn't appreciate the swipe against the Catholic Church's hierarchy (bishops with high hats and scepters) during the St. Nicholas segment. I do like the St. Nicholas story, but it was contrived here with the original St. Nicholas doing a ""ho-ho-ho"" (I am not kidding) just before being told by his assistant to start the deliveries (presumably of gifts).Second, if indeed the simplicity of the original Nativity is to be stressed, with Jesus born to Mary and Joseph in a cave, laid in a feeding manger, then perhaps they should have cast a Mary who had not just had her nails done. There they were, as Mary was holding the Christ child, each nail impeccable - and painted. And their garments? Perfectly clean, even looking like they'd just been ironed. Third, don't direct so that we can see the direction. Head turns, puzzled looks, earnest looks . . . I shouldn't be hearing in my head the director's exact stage directions. ""OK, look right at him then turn away."" Fourth, this was not about Saving Christmas.

1.0,A must avoid Christmas,"Watched 'Saving Christmas' out of curiosity to see if it really was as bad as the universal panning, its ranking on the Bottom 100 and its Razzie wins and nominations in most categories made out. The film is not available in my country, but the full film can be found online for anyone to see just in case anybody is wondering how it came to be watched by me.Finally seeing 'Saving Christmas', it turned out it not only really is that terrible but is one of my most regretted film viewings. One where a very early bailing was strongly considered but generously stuck with it in order to be fair, never judge films without seeing the whole thing (wish that more people did that instead of bragging about walking out after twenty minutes or something similarly ridiculous). It is by far the worst film of 2014, an easy contender for the worst of the decade and is bottom 5 material.And Kirk Cameron's immature and condescending defence of 'Saving Christmas' and attacking those who hated it (note to Mr Cameron, you don't have to be an atheist or even religious to find 'Saving Christmas' a terrible film, speaking as someone who is neither but with not a biased against Christians bone in my body) is a perfect example of what is wrong with how people express their opinions on film, critics and film watchers today. People who have an inability to tell the difference between fact and opinion, resort to the ""I'm right and you're wrong"" cliché and have to insult others, bash critics and invent ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories.Back to talking about 'Saving Christmas', the whole thing is hopelessly inept. It feels very slapped together with no rhyme or coherence, with amateurishly designed, written and acted biblical flashbacks, a lot of padding with scenes that go on forever (got tired of the scenes in the car fast, which saw lots of forced at best acting and gobbledegook that passes for dialogue), lots of repetition (like with the hot chocolate and the car conversations) and others having no reason for being there and Cameron's dubious generalisations (refuse to call them facts) and narration that come over as preachy, biased, self-absorbed sermonising standing out as especially bad. Oh and that ending dance sequence was an abomination in every sense, pacing, choreography, music, everything.It even looks bad, with some of the most artificial production values one will find anywhere let alone a film, complete with pedestrian photography and disjointed editing. The music was instantly forgettable as soon as the film was finally over and as for the direction, what direction? There is no coherence to the whole thing, the pacing is all over the place (interminably dull mostly) and there has never been more non-existent direction of actors, even on films riffed on MST3K.Writing is appalling from heavy-handed, egotistical start to abominable finish. That for Cameron has already been discussed but there is nothing heart-warming, funny or insightful about 'Saving Christmas', nothing that makes one think hard or feel anything. For a festive occasion, one couldn't imagine and will never see again a more drearily portrayed Christmas, this actually felt like it was made by people who hated Christmas even more than Ebeneezer Scrooge did. One is just bored out of their mind and angry at their life being wasted on a film that has no engagement, is so poorly put together and made, is impossible to learn anything from or get emotionally invested in and talks at them. Am not easily preached at, but 'Saving Christmas' talked at and down to me.Cameron's ""acting"" is extremely forced and patronising, pretty much like mugging, throughout and his huge ego bursts alive just as much on screen, in his material and how he delivered it, as it did when he attacked those who panned the film for far more legitimate reasons than he and the very small minority agreeing with him can ever give for finding any kind of value in the film. To me he is hypocritical as well as egotistical, due to that it is Christians that are more likely than anybody else to feel patronised to the most. The other cast members are not worth mentioning, don't even remember many, that's how much Cameron and his ego dominates.Overall, one of, and one of the biggest examples of, not many irredeemably awful films out there. Unless watching for curiosity's sake, this is a must avoid. 0/10 (an unheard of rating for me these days, have grown to hate giving them out, but 'Saving Christmas' is in the top 10 of the most deserving recipients of it).

1.0,Saving Christmas,"I knew the negativity surrounding this Christmas film, including it being in the Bottom 100 list on IMDb, and on the Wikipedia page ""List of films considered the worst"". I didn't read much about the plot, I had my guesses what it would involve, I knew I had to watch to see why it was bad. Basically, the film opens with Kirk (Razzie winning Kirk Cameron) talking to the audience beside a fireplace, explaining his love of Christmas. He expresses his views on the contemporary celebration of Christmas, questioning if people have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas, i.e. the Christian story of the birth of Christ, and that the holiday may have become overwhelmed by modern traditions. He explains that many see Christmas as an excuse to spoil kids, pretence and obligations, having perverted symbols with hidden meaning, a pointless distraction, and having needless spending, commercialism, he also mentions many believe it to be a worship for atheists, paganism and elf worship. It then switches to the main narrative, where Kirk attends a Christmas party at his sister's house. He notices that his brother-in-law, Christian (Darren Doane, also writing, producing, and directing), is not celebrating like the other guests. When asked why, Christian tells Kirk that he feels the holiday became too commercialised and consumerist and mentions the Pagan elements. Kirk tells Christian he is wrong and recites the Nativity, seen in cartoon form. Meanwhile, Diondre (David Shannon) and another guest (Raphi Henley) discuss conspiracy theories. Kirk later finds Christian hiding in the car. Christian complains that several elements of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees and Santa Claus, are not biblical in origin. Kirk tells the stories of why Christmas trees and Santa truly are in fact religious things. The trees were created by God, appearing in the Garden of Eden, that baubles on trees represent the fruit that Adam and Eve ate, and the lights on them can be seen as the light of God. Christian suggests the name ""Santa"" is an anagram of ""Satan"" and that he is not a Christian figure. However, Kirk explains that Santa Claus is Saint Nicholas, and was in fact a representative for God, giving presents for those who truly believed. Kirk also suggests that Jesus was brought into the world to die, that his gifts of frankincense and myrrh were given to be used in his burial, and that he was born and died in the same material. Reassured of Christmas' Christian roots, Cameron and Christian return to the party. Kirk issues a plea to the audience to make Christmas an overtly religious holiday again, ""for our children"". Then the guests perform a hip hop song and breakdance, set to ""Angels We Have Heard on High"". It ends with Kirk telling everyone to feast, suggests the audience organise the best dinner possible for Christmas, but not to forget it is a celebration of God. Also starring Razzie nominated Bridgette Cameron as Kirk's Sister, and Ben Kientz as St. Nick. From the title, I thought this was going to be a simple predictable film about a guy ""saving Christmas"" in some kind of adventure, but I got nothing like that at all. If this is supposed to be funny, I wasn't laughing, I just found the film an excuse for Christian preaching. Almost the entirety of the film was ramming the Christian belief down our throats, and it felt really patronising also. I will admit the comparisons of Christian traditions to things in Christmas we recognise, and embrace was fairly interesting, but it doesn't make me want to recognise Christianity. The poppy version of Silent Night during the opening credits was fairly catchy as well. Obviously, I do recognise the birth of Jesus as being the origin of the holiday, but I just see Christmas as a fun time with the family, with good food, presents, decorations, songs, and films and TV. People should be allowed to celebrate Christmas however they want, and not have religion force-fed to them, and that is why I found this an annoying, unfunny and pointless seasonal comedy. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay for Darren Doane and Cheston Hervey, and Worst Screen Combo for Kirk Cameron & His Ego, and it was nominated for Worst Director for Darren Doane.

1.0,"An interminable, shoddily-researched lecture masquerading as comedy","For those of us who have watched Kirk Cameron pontificate on the wonders of the banana, or read his musings on the legitimacy of the existence of fire-breathing dragons, we know that Kirk Cameron himself is comedy gold. One might expect more hilarity from Cameron in Saving Christmas, but Cameron actually intentionally tries to build a comedy here, and the result is an unfunny, unfocused, interminable mess.The film begins with an uncomfortable scene involving Kirk Cameron sitting in a chair, lecturing at the audience. ""They don't want us to love Christmas,"" Cameron declares authoritatively, never bothering to define exactly who ""they"" are. Cameron drones on for several more minutes, and at this point in the film, I heard a kid in the back of the theater yawn loudly—perhaps an audible protest that this film would not be the exciting romp promised on the poster.Finally, the film cuts away from Kirk Cameron, and we see several characters enjoying a Christmas party. But then we see Kirk Cameron again, the film freezes, and we hear Kirk Cameron narrating about himself: ""That's me—Kirk!"" More lecturing ensues.Eventually, a character by the name of Christian (almost as clever as ""Josh Wheaton""), a Christian himself, despondently finds his way to a car, apparently disillusioned by the materialism of Christmas. Enter Kirk Cameron, who enters the vehicle and does what he does best—more lecturing.The majority of the film takes place in this car as Kirk lectures to Christian, with occasional cutaways to Biblical imagery. Cameron tries to make the case that Christmas traditions, such as celebratory trees and gifts, all somehow originated with Christianity, not paganism. (Never mind the fact that ancient paganism predates Christianity.) ""Last time I checked, God created the winter solstice!"" is the type of asinine reasoning you'll hear from Kirk Cameron throughout the film. Cameron's facts are both dubious and sparse, and his connections are spurious—but Christian is nevertheless invariably blown away by Kirk Cameron's apparently amazing insight.Perhaps aware that interminable lecturing on its own would be unbearable for an audience, the film provides characters with quirky personalities in an effort to break up the tedium. In particular, we are treated to a scene back in the house of two characters rambling schizophrenically as they drink hot chocolate. It has nothing to do with Christian's story, it makes the movie feel unfocused, it goes on for far too long, and if my theater is any indication, it is not funny at all. In fact, there was dead silence in my theater throughout the entire run of this ""comedy"" film.The film ends with a dance sequence that feels like it lasts ten minutes, as well as multiple, gratuitous blooper scenes—I suppose for no reason other than to pad the running time. Just when you think it's finally over, we see Kirk Cameron again, and he continues to lecture the audience—this time about how materialism is just fine, because Jesus came to us in a material body, after all.One gets the impression that Kirk Cameron actually started reading his own Bible, was disturbed by what he found (such as Jesus' instruction to ""go sell your possessions and give to the poor""), and produced this film as a desperate justification for his own hypocrisy.At my theater, nobody laughed, and nobody stayed for the end credits. This purported comedy film fails at every level.

1.0,What an awful way to start this year's Christmas season,"This just so happens to be the most recent movie that I was able to easily find online. I guess the best thing is that religion does encourage sharing. A pity it had to be expressed with what some people consider to be the worst movie ever made. I remember Bill Maher criticizing ""Noah"" and later in the same year he criticized this. He thought ""Noah"" was the worst religious movie? It was so awesome proving him wrong! When I saw the trailer for this film, the movie itself seemed like a never ending commercial and that's exactly what I got! I guess ""Santa And The Ice Cream Bunny"" is technically a worse Christmas movie. That doesn't stop this from still being unwatchable.Everything about this shows idiocy. Even the company's logos aren't done right! We see a bunch of logos in the beginning and then four minutes later we get another logo appearing out of order! What?! How pathetic is a movie when you mess up that?! I think they even show it a third time when they introduce the movie's title! So this movie features Kirk Cameron telling his brother in law the true meaning of Christmas. I thought this would mostly take place in the car featuring them talking. It actually would have been better if it HAD been just that. It features Kirk talking about how Christmas trees represent the wooden cross Jesus was crucified on. First of all, that's pathetic. Second, what does Jesus dying even have anything to do with Christmas?! It would make more sense to have Easter trees! He does talk about the story of the real Saint Nicholas. Yes, he was indeed a real person and Santa Claus is in fact based on him. Except that it actually shows him beating someone up to show what a great guy he is! I'm serious, this movie says that attacking people who don't share your beliefs is okay. We get this weird scene before that which shows a guy dressed as Santa actually threatening the audience! I was sincerely scared by this part! So yeah, celebrate Christmas or we'll beat you up. The set design is horrendous. In the beginning, you can easily tell that Cameron is drinking from an empty cup. How cheap are you when you can't even afford hot chocolate on your set? The other main character is actually named Christian. He does seem to agree with Kirk after thirty minutes. They could have just ended the movie right there! Instead, they have some of the worst padding I have ever seen in my entire life! The use of slow motion is unbearably stupid. There's a scene where Christian actually slides into the room in slow motion. Is this trying to be an action movie or something? We get more scenes as the characters literally wave their hands around in slow motion. What does this mean?! We get scenes of everyone dancing and it's just slowed down, probably for no reason other than to fill the mere 79 minute length of this movie. It is one of the ugliest films to look at I've ever seen. So Christian learns his lesson and goes back and the screen freezes with the phrase ""Merry Christmas"". Well, the movie's over now, right? Nope! They show him talking about his wife and then it seems like it's ended, but it still hasn't! Then they dance everywhere and leave the scene. For the third time, this movie is over, right? NO! Then we see them eating and ""finally"" the credits come in. There's just outtakes. Is it over yet? No, we actually get the longest scene after the movie credits I have literally witnessed in my entire life. There's a two minute sequence that just shows people talking. These are the same things who earlier put cups over their mouths to talk about conspiracy theories. Yes, that really happened.The most insulting thing is probably at the end when Kirk tells the audience that it's okay to be materialistic. Why? He literally says it's because Jesus was the materialistic form of God. A human body is not a material. That goes against everything Christianity or the Bible or Jesus or whoever has ever said. If you want to justify Christmas decorations, here's how to do it. Just say that Christmas is a time where people work extra hard to get everything prepared so they can be with other people and be more charitable than any other time of year. Christmas cookies and presents might not be in the Bible, but that's the message that Christmas should have!

1.0,God Awful Poop,"This movie was so horrible that the CIA could use it to torture terrorists. Being forced to watch just a few minutes of this would be enough to make any one give up all their secrets just so they don't force you to watch it again.Kirk Cameron has proved that he is a nut time and time again. This time he makes a cash grab for money with inconsistencies in history and then uses the same logic and lack of intelligence as he did in Way of the Master. I can find no redeeming qualities of this movie other than it finally ended.Worst movie ever? Eh, well maybe not, but it definitely deserves to be in the bottom ten for the historical and scientific inaccuracies.",god awful poop,this movie was so horrible that cia could use it torture terrorists being forced watch just few minutes this would be enough make any one give up all their secrets just so they dont force you watch it again kirk cameron has proved that he is nut time time again this time he makes cash grab money with inconsistencies history then uses same logic lack intelligence as he did way master i can find no redeeming qualities this movie other than it finally ended worst movie ever eh well maybe not but it definitely deserves be bottom ten historical scientific inaccuracies,0.45000000000000007,-0.2839285714285714,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.58}"
,Don't let your children watch this movie,I can not in words convey how awful this movie is. It doesn't work as a movie as it is not fun or entertaining in any way. It doesn't work as a documentary as it present extremely bizarre ideas as facts.I would put a advisory GP-13 warning on this one. Parents should be strongly cautioned against letting their children watch this. The material may very well be hurtful and inappropriate for children under 13-years.Apparently this movie managed to gross $2.5 million at the box office in a two week run - that is a depressingly high figure and sad testament to the society of today.,dont let your children watch this movie,i can not words convey how awful this movie is it doesnt work as movie as it is not fun or entertaining any way it doesnt work as documentary as it present extremely bizarre ideas as facts i would put advisory gp 13 warning this one parents should be strongly cautioned against letting their children watch this material may very well be hurtful inappropriate children under 13 years apparently this movie managed gross 2 5 million at box office two week run that is depressingly high figure sad testament society today,0.4519444444444444,0.007777777777777782,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.45}"
