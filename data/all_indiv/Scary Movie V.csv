5.0,Don't expect much.,"It's fair to say that it is the worst of the series, it's let down by some really awful scenes, and some dire performances, but, it still has some of the old magic, and a few times I did find myself laughing. The scene between Sheen and Lohan was perhaps the worst thing I have ever seen, it was appalling, almost like an attempt to replicate the Pamela Anderson scene, but it was just terrible. The Black Swan scenes were lots of fun, and nicely produced, they felt at odds with lots of the film.Is it the case that people's humour has changed since the early films, or were the jokes simply not funny? Personally I think it's the latter, in fairness though it isn't as if there were great horror movies to parody.It's poor, but will still give the odd chuckle. 5/10",dont expect much,its fair say that it is worst series its let down by some really awful scenes some dire performances but it still has some old magic few times i did find myself laughing scene between sheen lohan was perhaps worst thing i have ever seen it was appalling almost like attempt replicate pamela anderson scene but it was just terrible black swan scenes were lots fun nicely produced they felt at odds with lots film is it case that peoples humour has changed since early films or were jokes simply not funny personally i think its latter fairness though it isnt as if there were great horror movies parody its poor but will still give odd chuckle 5 10,0.5915343915343916,-0.10780423280423278,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.09}"
1.0,"""Scary Movie 5""- Unwatchable.","Look, I'm not going to sit here and try to explain and justify my enjoyment of the first four entries in the long-running ""Scary Movie"" series. It's trash in every capacity, plain and simple. Cynical, trendy trash that only seeks to quickly capitalize on whatever is new or hip with filmgoing crowds through only the most base and lowest-common of denominators. Not a single film in the franchise could be called ""art."" And yet... I get a kick out of them. Particularly the second and third films, which were actually very amusing. They may be trash, but they're fun trash. Enjoyable trash. Entertaining trash. Trash with a charming cast and just enough chuckles to make them worth a go on a slow, rainy day at home. Yeah, you'll feel your IQ dropping during some of the stupider moments of those previous films, but they were never so bad as to be offensive or outright dismissed. Then there's ""Scary Movie 5."" ...whelp, this series was fun while it lasted, I guess.I'll level with you. This is one of those very rare occasions where even trying to force myself to watch a movie in order to be able to write a fair and balanced IMDb review, I just couldn't. I honestly was unable to. I had to start skimming through because the film was making me angry. Furious even. How could a series that was honestly never more than just silly, broad parody fall so hard, so quickly? It's shocking just how aggressively unfunny and tedious a film this is. Even by the midway point of the opening scene- a brutally prolonged ""Paranormal Activity"" parody involving Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to make a sex tape- the humor had been completely sapped and it was running on fumes.And this downward spiral only continued with each passing scene, every awkwardly contrived pop-culture reference and all the nonsensical attempts at lampooning then-recent releases. Essentially a melding of ""Mama"", ""Paranormal Activity"", the rebooted ""Planet of the Apes"" series and ""Black Swan"" with a smattering of plot elements from other major films, the storyline is a fundamental mess, with only the most tenuous of connections to string together the constant barrage of shockingly dead on arrival humor. Yes, you could argue that the fourth film's combination of ""Saw"", ""The Grudge"" and ""War of the Worlds"" was messy and contrived... but at least it tried. This one can't even muster up the energy to do that.Story goes that the production was a bit of a mess, with upwards of half the film being hastily re-written, re-shot and re-edited during last minute pick-ups barely two months before release without the participation of original (and solely credited) director Malcolm D. Lee. And it shows. Badly. Even giving it the biggest cut of slack I can, it feels like a mish-mash of several different visions and just stinks of a perplexing combination of apathy and desperation. I have a feeling you can tell which scenes were re-shot and which were in the original version as the tone and feeling will radically change from scene to scene. Some scenes feel like soulless attempts at patching together jokes whereas others feel like everyone was trying... way too hard. And as a result, it comes off disjointed and honestly just uncomfortable to watch.Even the return of Simon Rex in a starring role after his turn as a supporting character in the previous two films (albeit as a new character here) can't save this trainwreck... and I'm one of the people who actually really enjoyed his work in those films as the lovable goofball. Then again, he's the only returning co-star of any previous films, with series leads Anna Faris and Regina Hall- the two beating hearts of the entire series- having long since jumped ship. So I don't know what I expected. If the franchise film can't even attract the attention of its own lead cast members and instead has to upgrade a smaller supporting cast member to be the new star, it's usually not the best of signs.While it may not be quite as condescending and grating as, say... a ""Seltzerberg""-level parody, there's just no salvaging any laughs here. It's a confused, contrived, unfunny and even uncomfortable experience trying to watch ""Scary Movie 5"", and try as I might... I couldn't do it. It's up there with ""Going Overboard"" and ""Fat Slags: The Movie"" as one of the most inherently unwatchable comedies I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.I really have no other choice but to give ""Scary Movie 5"" a tragic 1 out of 10.

1.0,Unbelievably sh!t,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningI'm used to seeing spoofs where I know the films that are being parodied, but the recent crop of franchised, sanitised horror films have failed to catch my attention, so it was no help that I hardly even knew any of the films Scary Movie 5 was sending up. But know them or not, what can't be denied is what started out as an inspired, refreshing, if gross and thoroughly none PC idea got completely carried away with itself and just descended in to painfully unfunny dross. And so this fifth instalment, coming seven years after the last one, has an air of desperation about it, like some lazy studio executives thinking up something cheap and heartless for a quick buck. They've certainly failed to provide something even vaguely resembling a coherent plot, and so Scary Movie 5, lacking the Wayans Brothers touch that got it started, is left to just drag on in to the wilderness.Barely 70 minutes long, it's hard to think how something so short could be so torturous, but as it drags along without the merest hint of a laugh as it does, it becomes even more of a painful slog to the end.

3.0,I almost regret not walking out of the theater.,"The era of spoof and parody is dead.Let me start off by saying that I knew this film was going to be horrible from the start. I had read reviews and knew it was bad, but being so infatuated with film and theater, I actually wanted to see the movie to diagnose exactly what made it so horrible. (Insult me if you must, but I have a lot of free time on my hands and I love all kinds of movies.)I'm not gonna lie, I went into the theater with the hope that on some slight chance, I would enjoy the film. Wrong. The movie was so boring and tasteless that I was actually distracted with my phone for some parts during the film, which is of the utmost rarity for me. The horrible acting and line delivery dried this film out so much that I don't know where to begin. Ashley Tisdale was definitely not as good as Anna Faris was, and obviously, everyone will compare the two. I hate to admit it, but Mac Miller, Snoop Dogg, and Katt Williams all could have made audiences laugh with the material they were given, but were just too dry. Admittedly, there were some very rare parts of the movie that had a somewhat witty humor to it, but it was only once or twice, and weak at that. The rest of the stupid slapstick humor was just so lame and dragging. Slapstick humor should stay within the PG level of humor for the kids. On that note, the movie had overly crude, and just STUPID sexual humor that was just stupid and weak. Even hard R teenage sex comedies are more sophisticated than this. I laughed maybe one time, and it wasn't even a laugh. I kinda exhaled sharply while smiling. Overall, there was almost no sophisticated or witty humor, horrid acting, and it was all just plain bad. So yes, the reviews are correct, it was horrible. The only reason I give it a 3 instead of a 1 was because hundreds and hundreds of people put months and months of work into an 85 minute piece of what they thought was art, and giving a movie a 1 or maybe a 2 is too disrespectful to the art that is film. (But then again, this movie is pretty disrespectful to the art that is film as well.)",i almost regret not walking out theater,era spoof parody is dead let me start off by saying that i knew this film was going be horrible start i had read reviews knew it was bad but being so infatuated with film theater i actually wanted see movie diagnose exactly what made it so horrible insult me if you must but i have lot free time my hands i love all kinds movies im not gonna lie i went into theater with hope that some slight chance i would enjoy film wrong movie was so boring tasteless that i was actually distracted with my phone some parts during film which is utmost rarity me horrible acting line delivery dried this film out so much that i dont know where begin ashley tisdale was definitely not as good as anna faris was obviously everyone will compare two i hate admit it but mac miller snoop dogg katt williams all could have made audiences laugh with material they were given but were just too dry admittedly there were some very rare parts movie that had somewhat witty humor it but it was only once or twice weak at that rest stupid slapstick humor was just so lame dragging slapstick humor should stay within pg level humor kids that note movie had overly crude just stupid sexual humor that was just stupid weak even hard r teenage sex comedies are more sophisticated than this i laughed maybe one time it wasnt even laugh i kinda exhaled sharply while smiling overall there was almost no sophisticated or witty humor horrid acting it was all just plain bad so yes reviews are correct it was horrible only reason i give it 3 instead 1 was because hundreds hundreds people put months months work into 85 minute piece what they thought was art giving movie 1 or maybe 2 is too disrespectful art that is film but then again this movie is pretty disrespectful art that is film as well,0.6198489010989012,-0.16585164835164837,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.39}"
1.0,Terrifying in all the worst ways.,"It is almost inconceivable to imagine how much effort a group of people would have to put into making a film as bad as Scary Movie 5. The latest instalment in the series of lazy spoofs, not including some unforgivable side projects including Date Movie and Epic Movie, this film offers virtually nothing to its audience, insulting their intelligence for an hour-and-a-half with perhaps the worst collection of blatantly uninspired and recycled gags ever put to celluloid.The film's horrendous excuse for a plot centres on a suburban wife (Ashley Tisdale) and her dimwitted husband (Simon Rex) moving into a haunted house with their possessed adopted children. From there, the film brings its staple of parodying the biggest blockbusters of the last few years, but does so without a semblance of relevance, creativity or wit. It says a lot about the film that the only half-laughs to be had come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan sharing the opening scene- an incredibly stupid and borderline cringe-worthy, but inexplicably entertaining chuckle at their fall from grace. It's all downhill from there, though, as the rest of the film plays out as a series of unconnected set pieces seen literally hundreds of times before. Often, such an unappealing movie is still able to salvage some hope by suiting itself for a target market, but it is hard to see any audience group, from 15 year-olds to stoners, defending this abomination.One would have to drink Lindsay under the table, smoke copious amounts of bud with Snoop Dogg and/or Lion and snort pure tiger blood with Charlie to even come close to drawing any semblance of enjoyment from this disaster. An imminent sweep of this year's Razzies doesn't seem like ironic punishment enough for one of the worst films ever made.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

1.0,A Nutshell Review: Scary MoVie,"I thought after some days of hectic work I'd pick the funniest film on release this week to laugh my rear off, but unfortunately Scary Movie 5 turns in a disappointing form, with the Wayan brothers abandoning their franchise for A Haunted House instead. Despite having David Zucker in a writing capacity, this installment seems finally to have run out of steam in its long-running franchise, one which took the horror films in between them and give them the spoof treatment. And the lack of material shows despite the seven year absence, having to touch non-horror films as well given the wafer thin content upon which to draw inspiration from and to make fun of.And you would think that their crowning glory, having the two Tinseltown folks who can't seem to get out of trouble and the wrong side of the limelight - Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan - would be a tad interesting, but it's not. Both look like they were in it for the paycheck, and couldn't care less to ham it up a little. The jokes they partook in were really bad, with absolutely nothing to laugh at or about, and if they were to think they have a second career as comedians, they just might want to think again, given their lack of comic timing.No spoof of any horror film today would be without the Paranormal Activity style of video cameras being mounted almost everywhere, with the playback naturally being remotely hilarious, especially when people tend to miss the whole point of what they were hoping to see. Forming the basis for whatever semblance of a storyline is that of Mama, which involves Jody (Ashley Tisdale) and Dan (Simon Rex) picking up three spooky kids, thrown into a mix of Paranormal Activity, complete with a haunted house, Mama, and a housekeeper whose antics were probably the best bits in the film.Then came some other story development that linked up Black Swan, RIse of the Planet of the Apes and Evil Dead, for the most parts, and so you have one really amalgamated piece of narrative that had tried its best to blend these diverse stories together, but as it turned out, someone forgot to include genuine comedy in the film, short of tapping into the same old bags of toilet humour just for laughs. Some worked, and most didn't. Perhaps it is time to retire the franchise, for good. Even A Haunted House, was miles better than this, without having its jokes run stale, or feeling forced.The many cameo appearances, do nothing to save the film from its depths of woeful scenes trying their hardest to pass off as comedy. And as if sitting through the film isn't torture enough, you can elect to stay until after the end credits to extend that dreaded feeling for a scene longer.",nutshell review scary movie,i thought after some days hectic work id pick funniest film release this week laugh my rear off but unfortunately scary movie 5 turns disappointing form with wayan brothers abandoning their franchise haunted house instead despite having david zucker writing capacity this installment seems finally have run out steam its long running franchise one which took horror films between them give them spoof treatment lack material shows despite seven year absence having touch non horror films as well given wafer thin content upon which draw inspiration make fun you would think that their crowning glory having two tinseltown folks who cant seem get out trouble wrong side limelight charlie sheen lindsay lohan would be tad interesting but its not both look like they were it paycheck couldnt care less ham it up little jokes they partook were really bad with absolutely nothing laugh at or about if they were think they have second career as comedians they just might want think again given their lack comic timing no spoof any horror film today would be without paranormal activity style video cameras being mounted almost everywhere with playback naturally being remotely hilarious especially when people tend miss whole point what they were hoping see forming basis whatever semblance storyline is that mama which involves jody ashley tisdale dan simon rex picking up three spooky kids thrown into mix paranormal activity complete with haunted house mama housekeeper whose antics were probably best bits film then came some other story development that linked up black swan rise planet apes evil dead most parts so you have one really amalgamated piece narrative that had tried its best blend these diverse stories together but as it turned out someone forgot include genuine comedy film short tapping into same old bags toilet humour just laughs some worked most didnt perhaps it is time retire franchise good even haunted house was miles better than this without having its jokes run stale or feeling forced many cameo appearances do nothing save film its depths woeful scenes trying their hardest pass off as comedy as if sitting through film isnt torture enough you can elect stay until after end credits extend that dreaded feeling scene longer,0.4684397163120568,0.058687943262411356,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.35}"

My girlfriend and I went to see it on the 12th, we were so excited because we both love the previous films. 5 to 10 minutes into it, neither of us were laughing, just straight face. I whispered over to her and told her this is really stupid, she agreed. None of other people that were sitting in the room laugh either. I can't believe we actually sat through the whole movie until the end, since we paid for it already. It had like 3 moments that made us chuckle a bit, but that was it. If I could demand my money back, I would. Little note for the producers- Instead of paying huge amounts of money to the celebrities, how about spend some in developing the story and jokes?

1.0,The worst one of the entire series,"The only intelligent actor/actress from the entire Scary Movie series is Anna Ferris. You know why I say that, is because she wasn't in Scary Movie 5. She was smart. I'm not sure exactly what went wrong with this one, but I enjoyed the last 4 a lot more. Given that the 4th one was reaching a new level of stupidity, it was still 10x more funnier than the 5th. I regret paying $10 to watch this. This is the 2nd time in two weeks that I have made the mistake to pay money to see a stupid movie that ended up making me completely question why I go to the movies. Hollywood needs to wake up. Just because you can charge people money to see a movie, doesn't mean you should. Certain movies do not belong at the movie theater, and this one should have been on that list. The director should have never let this movie leave their studio, and for the sake of all of the actors, someone there should have stopped this movie from being produced. Again - I enjoyed the first 4, but I am now done with the Scary Movie saga. Enough is enough, this is just insulting. You can easily tell that even the highest paid actors like Charlie Sheen and that chick from Modern Family, put on a massive layer of suck in their roles. Are we all getting that lazy now days that we are going to record ourselves doing a horrible job, posting it to the world, and expecting money to come rolling in?

,Looks Like Everyone Would Want Their Name Off This Disaster,"Scary Movie V (2013) BOMB (out of 4) Wow, an American comedy from 2013 that makes INAPPROPRIATE COMEDY seem a little funnier. I'm not even going to waste my time giving any sort of plot synapses because this thing is just so horridly bad that you can't help but wonder a few things. Apparently 60% of this movie was re-filmed by David Zucker because the original movie from Malcolm D. Lee just didn't work. Considering how awful this theatrical version is, one really has to wonder how much worse the original could have been. The big ""draw"" to this is that it spoofs other 2013 films like MAMA and it even spoofs EVIL DEAD, which was released a week earlier. The MAMA spoof takes up the majority of the running time and there are simply no funny moments. I sat there in the empty theater just shocked that anyone would want to admit that they were involved in this thing. The jokes were just downright funny with the majority of them being physical stuff but it simply wasn't funny. The EVIL DEAD stuff got a couple small laughs but certainly not enough to save the picture. Even worse is the BLACK SWAN stuff that just seems to be out-dated and, again, unfunny. Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex play the main couple but add zero. Katt Williams is really bland in his brief role and even Snoop Dogg and his pot jokes can't do anything. Oh yes, there's also the Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan stuff, which gets the film off to a very bad start. I guess Sheen just doesn't care what it does and Lohan has nothing better to do since she's now been in two horrid films in 2013.

1.0,A new low for the Scary Movie series.,"Most spoof movies tend to be a bit hit and miss; Scary Movie V is all miss. Its targets are a selection of recent horror movies - Mama, Paranormal Activity, Insidious and The Evil Dead - and, for no discernible reason at all, non-horror hits Inception, Black Swan, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and 50 Shades of Grey.Having already suffered through part 1-4, I was expecting part 5 to be bad (Anna Farris went so far as to get pregnant to avoid appearing in this one), but I never imagined it could be this awful! It's 88 minutes of utterly puerile, laugh-free nonsense that feels like it was written by a bunch of teenage boys (and not very smart ones at that). A jaw-droppingly terrible sex scene starring Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, Snoop Dogg raiding a marijuana farm, a crap Leonardo DiCaprio lookalike, monkeys throwing poop, a little girl humping someone's leg, a baby on fire, and a wild pool party held by automated pool cleaning machines (yes, you read that correctly!): just a few of the unbelievably dreadful moments in this total wreck of a movie.

My 15 year old son said it was the worst movie he has ever seen. Disjointed. People were leaving the theater before the halfway point and it is only an hour and a half. There is really not much you can say about it except to wait until it comes out on Netflix and even then it will hard to watch. Honestly I can't believe that after the movie company watched this movie they had the nerve to release it. In my opinion this would hurt your reputation as a Film maker more than helping by a long shot. There is a considerable difference in the quality of this Scary movie and the others, none of the original cast appear in the movie and it seems to be based mostly on paranormal activity, the set becomes very stagnant. My son said that the actual paranormal activity was funnier. My son loves the Scary movie brand, he said this one would give the franchise a bad name and he would give it a -2 if he could.This is a good reason to use Pirate Bay.

2.0,Horrible...but probably not deserving to be in the Bottom 100.,"I have not seen any of the previous ""Scary Movie"" films. The reason why I chose to watch this one, the least financially successful and apparently worst one of them is that it has made it to the infamous Bottom 100 on IMDB....the lowest ranked major movies of all time. I have a weird desire to not only see tons of foreign and art films, but occasionally I love a bad film...particularly if they are unintentionally funny. In the case of ""Scary Movie 5"", it's a case of being unintentionally NOT funny!When the movie begins, you know you are in for a horrid film as the opening scene stars Lindsay Lohan and Martin Sheen! What follows is a very episodic film starring many C and D-list actors that parodies (or is supposed to parody) scary teen films and a variety of non-scary movies as well. During the course of the story there are jokes about weiners, drugs, feces, demonic possessions, vomit, farting, toilets and other intellectual subjects. These jokes are presented rapid-fire. Most fall pretty flat or are disgusting...and a few actually are funny...but only a few. Overall, this is a mostly unfunny movie starring many annoying actors....but, it is NOT so horrible that it deserves to be in the Bottom 100.

1.0,BAD and not in a good way,"Don and Judy Sanders (Simon Rex & Ashley Tisdale) believe their family is being terrorized by a demon and must find a way to have this stop. This the basic plot. The rest are just skits that revolve around humans and demons to basically spoof other scary movies. None are funny or even come close to being funny.Being the brave soul I took out Scary Movie 5 (ah, but you knew it was a comedy and not scary) and found it quite unfunny and mostly annoying. . Some have said that this movie spoofs a lot of other scary movies. I wouldn't know, but if you have seen those movies, it will be up to you to decide what skits herein this movie spoofs. I could care less. But, I did learn that this was not a funny movie. It's true that the promos led me to believe I might enjoy this one. Wrong again. And, I was sure that the Mandatory Hollywood Rule for Silly and Stupid things would play a large part. And, without fail, they did, big time throughout the entire movie. This movie is all raunchy slap-stick and done badly by everyone. There was no one in charge of anything. There are a lot of stars in here for cameo purposes. I found the Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan skit shown in the promo to be good. I laughed when Sheen was pulled out of bed by a demon and his jewels stopped his flight into the door. Ouch, ouch, ouch! Sorry, but that was funny. However, that scene WAS NOT in the movie. Fooled again. They used another unfunny skit to Benny Hill music. Celebs I recognized: Snoop Dog, Heather Locklear, Jerry O'Connell and Mike Tyson and there are others whom I have no knowledge of. Other actors were made up to look like the real stars for example: Leonardo DeCaprio and the movie character: Madea. . What you will see: adults hitting kids, fecal fights, child's hair on fire, things shoved up rectums, a lot of fighting some with fists and pots and pans, pies and fruit made with fecal matter, kids humping legs, a microwave being humped I just cannot go on with this. There are outtakes after the movie and none, again, are remotely funny. You will see some mouthing language that you didn't hear during the actual movie.There is a Narrator throughout and he sounded very much like Morgan Freeman, but it was Josh Robert Thompson instead. To give credit to this movie for spoofing other movies would be wrong because everything was done in ultra raunchy and disgusting ways. Basically, what we have is raunchy slap-stick throughout.

1.0,Why does this movie even exist.,"This review won't take very long, as there are literally zero positive things to say about this film. It is beyond awful, one of the worst films I've seen ever, period. The movie didn't have me laughing once, the script seems to have been written by a room full of monkeys. The acting was awful and the effects (audio and visual) were laughable to say the least. I mean, this movie seemed like it was literally pulled from the trash and put in the theaters. The first Scary Movie wasn't half bad, but holy crap this series has gone done quicker than Lindsey Lohan's career. I just really don't know what else to say, the movie had absolutely no entertainment value of any kind, anywhere in the film.While I understand this movie is a parody and is supposed to be a ""so bad it's good"" movie, someone could make a parody of this movie it's so bad.

1.0,By far and away the worst of the series,"The first Scary Movie was very entertaining if rather mindless, 2 is uneven though much better than what is often said about it, 3 was a mixed bag and 4 was poor and until now was the worst of the four. This fifth entry was just awful with no redeeming values, the only movie of the series to be on the same level as rubbish like Disaster Movie and Epic Movie and actually comes dangerously close to being even worse. Visually it's cheap, with the way it's shot and edited strongly reminiscent of a poorly done direct-to-video movie and that is the same with the sets. The soundtrack is generic and like a noisy music video with a lot thrown in for the sake of it and very little adds anything to what is going on. The dialogue toe-curlingly bad in how inane and excessively vulgar it is. Nothing about it is funny or witty, much of it is immature and insulting, if the writers were clueless as to what was funny that comes through loud and clear. The funniest it gets? ""Help, there's a mad demon in my house"", and if you're thinking that that is also stupid, you're right, it is. There is not much story here to speak of, it was just an excuse seemingly to cobble together genre send-ups and parodies and the sheer idiocy only increases. And none of these are funny, some of the gags are drawn out to an unbearable degree, the ones sending up horrors like Evil Dead have nothing atmospheric, scary or remotely creepy about them and the bulimia and pregnancy gags were tasteless(and not mildly, this is more above-borderline offensive, in quite some while no other movie has evoked a reaction as extreme as this). There's even a surreal spoof on Fifty Shades of Grey, which came across as out of place. The acting is awful, and even that is an insult to the word awful. It wasn't a problem that the original cast weren't there, what was was that none of the actors had any spirit and energy to their performances, the few actors who do have some talent are wasted and some overact, Ashley Tisdale being the worst offender. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan send themselves and their tabloid reps embarrassingly, the Paranormal Activity spoof wasn't scary or halfway amusing in the slightest. In conclusion, a complete mess and by far the worst of an overall hit-and-miss movie series. 1/10 Bethany Cox",by far away worst series,first scary movie was very entertaining if rather mindless 2 is uneven though much better than what is often said about it 3 was mixed bag 4 was poor until now was worst four this fifth entry was just awful with no redeeming values only movie series be same level as rubbish like disaster movie epic movie actually comes dangerously close being even worse visually its cheap with way its shot edited strongly reminiscent poorly done direct video movie that is same with sets soundtrack is generic like noisy music video with lot thrown sake it very little adds anything what is going dialogue toe curlingly bad how inane excessively vulgar it is nothing about it is funny or witty much it is immature insulting if writers were clueless as what was funny that comes through loud clear funniest it gets help theres mad demon my house if youre thinking that that is also stupid youre right it is there is not much story here speak it was just excuse seemingly cobble together genre send ups parodies sheer idiocy only increases none these are funny some gags are drawn out unbearable degree ones sending up horrors like evil dead have nothing atmospheric scary or remotely creepy about them bulimia pregnancy gags were tasteless not mildly this is more above borderline offensive quite some while no other movie has evoked reaction as extreme as this theres even surreal spoof fifty shades grey which came across as out place acting is awful even that is insult word awful it wasnt problem that original cast werent there what was was that none actors had any spirit energy their performances few actors who do have some talent are wasted some overact ashley tisdale being worst offender charlie sheen lindsay lohan send themselves their tabloid reps embarrassingly paranormal activity spoof wasnt scary or halfway amusing slightest conclusion complete mess by far worst overall hit miss movie series 1 10 bethany cox,0.6051222651222651,-0.17381354568854568,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1.0,"Basically, an exploitation film for weed- and gangsta rap-obsessed 13-year-olds","I really don't know where to even start with this, so let's just get started. This movie is not funny. There you go - it fails as a comedy. In addition to that, it's dumb, mean-spirited, and in poor taste, and I think you're going to agree with me about that even if you like stuff that is in poor taste. I mean, this is basically an exploitation film for weed- and gangsta rap-obsessed 13-year-olds. It covers all the bases: sex scene involving clowns and ponies, sex scene involving pool cleaning machines, dildo collections being found by small children, things getting stuck up dogs' anuses, a scene featuring Snoop Dogg (or Snoop Lion or whatever he insists that people call him now) and a giant blunt, etc. Wow, this is multiplex entertainment in 2013?I saw the first Scary Movie and thought it was pretty amusing in places. I'm also a huge fan of totally absurd slapstick comedies like Airplane and the Naked Gun movies. What is it exactly that makes this film so awful where the others, at least on some level, succeeded? I can't think of any way to explain it except this: watching Scary MoVie is the film equivalent of eating White Castle sliders for an hour and a half, washing them down with a gallon of Mountain Dew, topping it all off with seven pounds of cheesecake and then doing the Mentos and Coke thing (featured in this film, incidentally) so you can projectile-puke the stuff you just ate all over your friends who were expecting it and think it's funny. Truly, honestly, that's the caliber of stuff you're going to subject yourself to for 90 minutes if you insist on watching this.The movie tries to make fun of Inception, Black Sawn, Evil Dead, etc., but it seems to me that you have to actually be smarter than something if you want to effectively make fun of it. Instead, they should make a movie that makes fun of all the Scary Movie movies. Honestly, they should be pretty easy targets. This movie does not have the minimum level of intelligence required to comment about anything at all. The best it can do is make ""peehole"" jokes and try to get the audience to laugh at monkeys flinging poo at the wall. No, it's really not funny.I'm racking my brains trying to recall if there was anything at all good about this film. I do remember laughing at a couple of the gags. That sex scene with clowns and ponies was actually somewhat amusing - there, I said it. I'm afraid this review is going to come off the wrong way because it sounds like I refuse to watch stuff that pushes boundaries of good taste. Hardly, man. I even liked Videodrome, which Roger Ebert called ""nauseating."" The real problem is that this film uses boundary-pushing as an excuse to be stupid. In reality, it's about as intelligent as a stoned middle school dropout, incidentally the only type of person I can imagine enjoying this.I was about to start getting depressed about the state of the world given that this kind of obvious dog dookie is considered entertainment, but it doesn't seem that other people found it all that entertaining either. I watched at least two couples walk out of the theater before the end of the film, so ultimately I'm concluding that there's probably some reason to have hope about the future of this planet. Thanks, Scary MoVie! Not that there's anything to be thankful for except that no one actually came up to me and hit me in the head with a shovel while the film was playing. They'll probably include that in part six.",basically exploitation film weed gangsta rap obsessed 13 year olds,i really dont know where even start with this so lets just get started this movie is not funny there you go it fails as comedy addition that its dumb mean spirited poor taste i think youre going agree with me about that even if you like stuff that is poor taste i mean this is basically exploitation film weed gangsta rap obsessed 13 year olds it covers all bases sex scene involving clowns ponies sex scene involving pool cleaning machines dildo collections being found by small children things getting stuck up dogs anuses scene featuring snoop dogg or snoop lion or whatever he insists that people call him now giant blunt etc wow this is multiplex entertainment 2013 i saw first scary movie thought it was pretty amusing places im also huge fan totally absurd slapstick comedies like airplane naked gun movies what is it exactly that makes this film so awful where others at least some level succeeded i cant think any way explain it except this watching scary movie is film equivalent eating white castle sliders hour half washing them down with gallon mountain dew topping it all off with seven pounds cheesecake then doing mentos coke thing featured this film incidentally so you can projectile puke stuff you just ate all over your friends who were expecting it think its funny truly honestly thats caliber stuff youre going subject yourself 90 minutes if you insist watching this movie tries make fun inception black sawn evil dead etc but it seems me that you have actually be smarter than something if you want effectively make fun it instead they should make movie that makes fun all scary movie movies honestly they should be pretty easy targets this movie does not have minimum level intelligence required comment about anything at all best it can do is make peehole jokes try get audience laugh at monkeys flinging poo at wall no its really not funny im racking my brains trying recall if there was anything at all good about this film i do remember laughing at couple gags that sex scene with clowns ponies was actually somewhat amusing there i said it im afraid this review is going come off wrong way because it sounds like i refuse watch stuff that pushes boundaries good taste hardly man i even liked videodrome which roger ebert called nauseating real problem is that this film uses boundary pushing as excuse be stupid reality its about as intelligent as stoned middle school dropout incidentally only type person i can imagine enjoying this i was about start getting depressed about state world given that this kind obvious dog dookie is considered entertainment but it doesnt seem that other people found it all that entertaining either i watched at least two couples walk out theater before end film so ultimately im concluding that theres probably some reason have hope about future this planet thanks scary movie not that theres anything be thankful except that no one actually came up me hit me head with shovel while film was playing theyll probably include that part six,0.6167438271604937,0.009182098765432078,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,"I used to like parody films, but this...","I have seen all Scary Movies, Disaster Movie, Superhero Movie, Epic Movie etc, and almost every time I was enjoying it, because of some funny scenes. If you like this type of movies - even if not, sometimes -, you can laugh out loud and have a good time either alone either with party. I am not saying that those films are the best way to spend your time with friends, but it could be a good - just good - choice. Definitely better than watching a horror movie like Scream, Paranormal Activity etc, in my opinion.However, in the case of Scary Movie 5, things are, unfortunately, different. What I am trying to say, is that this movie is not even amusing. Scary Movie 5 is really boring. The first time I tried to see the movie, I stopped watching at 30 minutes. The second time I was determined and, honestly, I tried to see the whole movie from the beginning, but it was hard. I asked myself: ""Why are you doing this to yourself? What's the purpose?"", and I stopped watching again.If you are in a good mood, and you want to see something that will help you, prefer Airplane, Naked Gun, Life of Brian or some other parodies. Maybe those movies not extremely funny, but I think they're better from the 5th Scary Movie. I don't recommend it, it's unworthy.",i used like parody films but this,i have seen all scary movies disaster movie superhero movie epic movie etc almost every time i was enjoying it because some funny scenes if you like this type movies even if not sometimes you can laugh out loud have good time either alone either with party i am not saying that those films are best way spend your time with friends but it could be good just good choice definitely better than watching horror movie like scream paranormal activity etc my opinion however case scary movie 5 things are unfortunately different what i am trying say is that this movie is not even amusing scary movie 5 is really boring first time i tried see movie i stopped watching at 30 minutes second time i was determined honestly i tried see whole movie beginning but it was hard i asked myself why are you doing this yourself whats purpose i stopped watching again if you are good mood you want see something that will help you prefer airplane naked gun life brian or some other parodies maybe those movies not extremely funny but i think theyre better 5th scary movie i dont recommend it its unworthy,0.6351851851851852,0.15401234567901234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.21}"
1.0,Seriously don't bother...,"This must be the worst film i've seen in the cinema, OK I wasn't expecting much this was just embarrassing and it isn't the least bit funny. The script and storyline are poor, the sequences are just mixed up and jumbled and you never know what's really going on, sketches that drag and drag to fill the majority of the film. No wonder the franchise was halted for so many years it's a joke. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan only have a minute of screen time and the Mike Tyson cameo is pretty lame.Overall one of the worst and definitely not worth the money at the cinema or a DVD purchase.",seriously dont bother,this must be worst film ive seen cinema ok i wasnt expecting much this was just embarrassing it isnt least bit funny script storyline are poor sequences are just mixed up jumbled you never know whats really going sketches that drag drag fill majority film no wonder franchise was halted so many years its joke charlie sheen lindsay lohan only have minute screen time mike tyson cameo is pretty lame overall one worst definitely not worth money at cinema or dvd purchase,0.5171296296296296,-0.11018518518518519,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.47}"
,The Scary Movie franchise has run its course!,"When it was invented, the concept of the ""Scary Movie"" spoofs was pretty funny. But now, just having seen ""Scary Movie 5"", I can say with certainty that they have worn out their welcome.Also, after seeing this latest one, I can see what a perfect actress Anna Faris was for the ones she was in. She contributes so much it might even be fair to say that Faris makes them worth watching. As much as I like Ashley Tisdale with her cute new nose, she is not the type of actress that can make this watchable. The main theme here is a spoof of the fairly recent horror movie ""Mama"". Having seen ""Mama"" the spoof wasn't particularly good or funny.Definitely a ""miss"" as entertainment, DVD on loan from my public library.",scary movie franchise has run its course,when it was invented concept scary movie spoofs was pretty funny but now just having seen scary movie 5 i can say with certainty that they have worn out their welcome also after seeing this latest one i can see what perfect actress anna faris was ones she was she contributes so much it might even be fair say that faris makes them worth watching as much as i like ashley tisdale with her cute new nose she is not type actress that can make this watchable main theme here is spoof fairly recent horror movie mama having seen mama spoof wasnt particularly good or funny definitely miss as entertainment dvd loan my public library,0.6274793388429751,0.19331955922865013,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"
4.0,Only good for a few chuckles,"They through a lot of parodies at you in this fifth installment, and there where only 3 or 4 times that I laughed, but for the most part I'm just staring at the screen and wondering how is this funny. It seems that the filmmakers are trying to too hard to be funny, and the more they are trying they fail completely failed. But I can see the parts where they where not trying so hard, are probably the parts that i was laughing.Ashley Tisdale who I don't doubt is a very talented actress, but is incredibly bland here, nothing she does just does not jump out at you. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan are pretty good spoofing themselves, but lets face they are already become parodies of themselves at this point. Simon Rex is alright, but really he is just there also. Not as bad has Movie 43, but still not as funny has it tried to be, but still good for a few chuckles.",only good few chuckles,they through lot parodies at you this fifth installment there where only 3 or 4 times that i laughed but most part im just staring at screen wondering how is this funny it seems that filmmakers are trying too hard be funny more they are trying they fail completely failed but i can see parts where they where not trying so hard are probably parts that i was laughing ashley tisdale who i dont doubt is very talented actress but is incredibly bland here nothing she does just does not jump out at you charlie sheen lindsay lohan are pretty good spoofing themselves but lets face they are already become parodies themselves at this point simon rex is alright but really he is just there also not as bad has movie 43 but still not as funny has it tried be but still good few chuckles,0.6174242424242423,0.13909090909090907,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.14}"
1.0,You couldn't pay me to see that again.,"Beyond rubbish. The only reason i didn't give this film a rating of absolute 0 is because IMDb didn't allow me to. In all honesty, the CIA should probably adopt this film as a method of torture in Guantanamo. The opening scene was probably the most humorous part of the film, even that was only a mild chuckle. The rest of the film was filled with random rubbish that no one in the cinema found amusing. Through out the whole film I only heard one laugh, and even that was from some women sat in front of me whose husband had just asked her what the hell they were watching. If you're considering watching this film, please don't waste your time. Watching this film will make you realize how precious your time is. You could tell that the rest of the audience was thinking this as well, simply from the way everyone more or less leaped out of their seats as soon as the ending credits appeared on the screen.
