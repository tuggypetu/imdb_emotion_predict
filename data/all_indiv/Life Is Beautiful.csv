10.0,"Funny, entertaining, and amazingly intense and dramatic.","I find it sad that so many people are so narrow-minded that they will not watch a movie that is black and white or, in this case, is subtitled. I feel sorry for people who refuse to watch a movie like Life Is Beautiful just because it is a foreign film. They have no idea what a beautifully acted and directed film this is, and they'll never know what an amazing experience they are missing. Life Is Beautiful manages to walk the extremely thin line between humor, fantasy, and tragedy. Sure, the film is clearly comedic, but nevertheless it manages to very effectively communicate the tremendous losses suffered in the Nazi concentration camps and has scenes at least as intense as any scene in Schindler's List. This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It manages to be so encompassing that you hardly notice the subtitles are even there. I proudly cast my vote of 10.",funny entertaining amazingly intense dramatic,i find it sad that so many people are so narrow minded that they will not watch movie that is black white or this case is subtitled i feel sorry people who refuse watch movie like life is beautiful just because it is foreign film they have no idea what beautifully acted directed film this is theyll never know what amazing experience they are missing life is beautiful manages walk extremely thin line between humor fantasy tragedy sure film is clearly comedic but nevertheless it manages very effectively communicate tremendous losses suffered nazi concentration camps has scenes at least as intense as any scene schindlers list this is one best films that i have ever seen it manages be so encompassing that you hardly notice subtitles are even there i proudly cast my vote 10,0.6950854700854703,0.1998717948717949,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"

9.0,One of the best movies ever.,"This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you.  After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. This portrayed the nazi 'state of mind' (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state. Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido's relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son. You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh. One can go on forever describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing.",one best movies ever,this is one those movies that have lasting effect you after watching it i found that it has less do with holocaust more do with human feelings beautiful relationship father his son holocaust provides ultimate context that brings highlights story adds yet another deep dimension movie no such piece art has ever before combined laughter tears sadness me before that is miracle movie realism movie is not its strong point but then again it is not supposed be this helps bringing audiences state mind away reality focusing feelings generated by forgetting about all external events developments war despite that movie does not fail point out element nazi psychology demonstrated by doctor who was obsessed with riddles this portrayed nazi state mind if ever such expression existed as sick mentally disturbed state life is really beautiful as you watch guidos relentless efforts make lovely exciting experience concentration camp his son you get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day yet you smile as he speaks his son makes him laugh one can go forever describing creativity this movie but one will not be able capture all its beauty writing,0.522172619047619,0.13343253968253965,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.18}"

10.0,"A satire set in a concentration camp, tough a hit internationally, was thought by some critics to be in bad taste...","Mixing humor and the Holocaust isn't anything new: Ernst Lubitsch's 'To Be Or Not To Be' is just one enduring classic; Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' is another; and 'Life Is Beautiful' has the small-town charm and ambiance of 'Amarcord,' and light-straight satire of 'The Great Dictator.'Set against the stark reality of World War II Europe, Roberto Benigni's sentimental fable is not a film about the Holocaust, it's a film about life and hope merely against the backdrop of the Holocaust... It's not a denial of the Holocaust, it is a manifestation that humor itself can be courage... It's not about betraying the experience of millions of Jews, it is about the great lengths a father will go to protect his family from the horrors of the Nazis... It's a demonstration of the power of cinema, it's art without claim, hope without fear, dreams without limitations... It's a motion picture about love, not a documentary about the Nazis... It delivers a powerful message that despite everythinglife is truly beautiful... The story begins in 1939 Italy, where a simple, free-spirited Italian Jew Guido Orefice (Benigni) and his poet friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) have dreams of owning their own bookstore... For now, however, Guido must be satisfied to wait tables, while Ferrucio is unable to get a job...Benigni's character is introduced during a long set of fast comedy scenes, particularly when he meets a cute gentile woman, DoraNicoletta Braschi, Benigni's real-life wife... When she 'falls out of the sky,' and he quickly nicknames her 'Principessa'... When he rides, in a fascist ball, on a horse painted green... When he turns a gloomy rainy night into a red carpet event... When he is caught by the Nazis as he hurries about securing the safety of his wife and son.. When his car speeds, without brakes, through a village and is mistaken for a king... Guido falls hard for the radiant schoolteacher, daughter of a wealthy family, and pursues her with all the charm and imagination he can discharge... In one sequence he pretends to be a school inspector and gives an impromptu speech on racial superiority before the assembled students and teachers, ending with a striptease...That hilarious side of the film takes up the first half... Benigni (who also wrote and directed) borrows a bit of Chaplin's grace and a bit of Groucho Marx charm... All of the action is so neatly contrived that the film essentially ends when it's over, and then begins again with the introduction of Guido and Dora's cute five-year-old son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) few years later... There, in 1945, we catch a glimpse of their enchanting household, but things are soon shattered, and the Nazis take Guido, with his tolerant uncle (Giustino Durano) and little Giosue off to an unidentified concentration camp... Dora races to the train station and demands to be put also on the train... At the death camp, and in order to protect his son from the nightmare of the place, Guido uses his imagination by creating the illusion that everything that's happening is just a game, an epic game that will be exciting and fun...He convinces Giosue that by hiding from the Gestapo soldiers (whom he refers to simply as the ""men who yell a lot"") and maintaining silence, he can gain the necessary points to win a tank... Not a toy tank, but a full-size tank, which they'll be free to take home...As co-writer, Benigni (with Vincenzo Cerami), doesn't just mix drama and comedy, he often hides drama in the comedy... The film does not dwell on the horrors of the camp, nor does it ignore them... With a memorable score by Nicola Piovani, ""Life Is Beautiful"" is an important film, triumphant, timeless, and sublime... It manages to entertain, educate, and move with its potent combination of humor, poignancy, and dignity... Roberto Benigni has taken pure horror and turned it into a love story between a man and a woman, between a father and his son... As an actor, Benigni manages with his wise and simple performance to make us laugh in tragic situations... He was very realistic, natural, distant from great special effects, far from Hollywood style, only nice and beautiful cinema...The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Foreign Film and Best Dramatic Score...",satire set concentration camp tough hit internationally was thought by some critics be bad taste,mixing humor holocaust isnt anything new ernst lubitschs be or not be is just one enduring classic mel brooks producers is another life is beautiful has small town charm ambiance amarcord light straight satire great dictator set against stark reality world war ii europe roberto benignis sentimental fable is not film about holocaust its film about life hope merely against backdrop holocaust its not denial holocaust it is manifestation that humor itself can be courage its not about betraying experience millions jews it is about great lengths father will go protect his family horrors nazis its demonstration power cinema its art without claim hope without fear dreams without limitations its motion picture about love not documentary about nazis it delivers powerful message that despite everything life is truly beautiful story begins 1939 italy where simple free spirited italian jew guido orefice benigni his poet friend ferrucio sergio bini bustic have dreams owning their own bookstore now however guido must be satisfied wait tables while ferrucio is unable get job benignis character is introduced during long set fast comedy scenes particularly when he meets cute gentile woman dora nicoletta braschi benignis real life wife when she falls out sky he quickly nicknames her principessa when he rides fascist ball horse painted green when he turns gloomy rainy night into red carpet event when he is caught by nazis as he hurries about securing safety his wife son when his car speeds without brakes through village is mistaken king guido falls hard radiant schoolteacher daughter wealthy family pursues her with all charm imagination he can discharge one sequence he pretends be school inspector gives impromptu speech racial superiority before assembled students teachers ending with striptease that hilarious side film takes up first half benigni who also wrote directed borrows bit chaplins grace bit groucho marx charm all action is so neatly contrived that film essentially ends when its over then begins again with introduction guido doras cute five year old son giosue giorgio cantarini few years later there 1945 we catch glimpse their enchanting household but things are soon shattered nazis take guido with his tolerant uncle giustino durano little giosue off unidentified concentration camp dora races train station demands be put also train at death camp order protect his son nightmare place guido uses his imagination by creating illusion that everything thats happening is just game epic game that will be exciting fun he convinces giosue that by hiding gestapo soldiers whom he refers simply as men who yell lot maintaining silence he can gain necessary points win tank not toy tank but full size tank which theyll be free take home as co writer benigni with vincenzo cerami doesnt just mix drama comedy he often hides drama comedy film does not dwell horrors camp nor does it ignore them with memorable score by nicola piovani life is beautiful is important film triumphant timeless sublime it manages entertain educate move with its potent combination humor poignancy dignity roberto benigni has taken pure horror turned it into love story between man woman between father his son as actor benigni manages with his wise simple performance make us laugh tragic situations he was very realistic natural distant great special effects far hollywood style only nice beautiful cinema film won academy awards best actor best foreign film best dramatic score,0.5630925324675322,0.19997587481962475,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,The most aptly named movie - A classic,"I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring. 'Life is beautiful' as the name goes is about a Jewish man, who falls in love with a non-Jewish lady, marries her, has a kid and who is then taken as a prisoner in a concentration camp along with his wife and kid. But the way he protects his kid from the horrors of the genocide, how he always tries to find ways to make his wife and kid smile and laugh, is what makes the movie, a MUST SEE.It is certainly one of the best movies that I have seen.",most aptly named movie classic,i have never my life seen movie that so truly symbolizes its name its message roberto benigni italian treasure house has probably given his viewers his best story performances entire theme person performing his duties as husband as father is very moving inspiring life is beautiful as name goes is about jewish man who falls love with non jewish lady marries her has kid who is then taken as prisoner concentration camp along with his wife kid but way he protects his kid horrors genocide how he always tries find ways make his wife kid smile laugh is what makes movie must see it is certainly one best movies that i have seen,0.40959383753501394,0.3547619047619048,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.38, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,A superb tragi-comedy,"Roberto Benigni's Vita e bella, is in many ways similar to Chaplin's Great Dictator. Both are comic attacks on fascism, but the former's is the more successful. Benigni initially accesses the emotions of his audience through simple comedy, which is a pleasant mix of Keaton and Chaplin. Romance ensues with his real life wife Nicoletta Braschi. The first half of this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior to the second, but this is certainly not the case. In the first section we follow the delightful romance that will eventually lead to marriage and the creation of the wonderful Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).It is the first half where the audience can laugh the loudest and delight at the immense comedy talent of Benigni. Unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course, his is simple innocent humour, which is all the more effective. The way he ties together little strand in the film to create comedy elements shows a great writing ability, and a mastery of timing when it comes to their execution on screen. Various incidents related to the rise of anti-semitism and fascism in Italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come to the fore in the second segment.Guido (Benigni) moves events on from Tuscany in 1939 to the last year of the war in a concentration camp. In this period he and Dora (Braschi) have had their son Giosue (Cantanarini). The five year old greatly reminds me of Toto in Cinema Paradiso, and plays an equally important role in his prospective film (though in Paradiso's case it is at the beginning of the movie). The relationship between the two is very similar to that of Jackie Coogan and Charlie Chaplin (though Benigni, unlike Chaplin, keeps the best of the comedy moments). Guido attempts to keep from the boy the horrors of what is going on, and this eventually manifests itself as a game where the aim is to score 100 points, with the winner winning a real tank (which, of course appeals to the young boy). Comic moments are still present, that involving Guido's translation of the rules of the camp is particularly notable, but it becomes somewhat more difficult to laugh when we consider the gravity of what is going on.The emphasis begins shifts, and we realise that this is a film about human spirit above all else. Guido not only appeals to the audience due to his comedy and sheer pleasantness, but also in the way that he loves his family and the measures that he will go to to protect them.This is certainly no Schindler's List, but it never pretends to be. Occasionally events seem a little contrived, but this does seem to work in the film's favour. However, this film avoids the tendency of Hollywood to go far over the top in emotional and credibility terms.Benigni shines like a lantern throughout the picture, showing that he is a talent, not only in comedy terms, that far outshines his peers. Cantanari is a delight, and Braschi also plays her part well. There is even an appearance by The Magnificent Seven's Horst Buchholz as Doctor Lessing, a man who events change for the worse.Please don't let the fact that it, to all but the Italians, is a foreign language film. The language itself adds a beauty of form to the film, much as it did in the case of Il Postino. This has to be a certainty for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, though something tells me that it will be overlooked for other awards as it is Italian and not a mainstream English language picture.Please see this film, and make up your own mind. It is appealing in so many different ways that I'm sure that you will not be disappointed.",superb tragi comedy,roberto benignis vita e bella is many ways similar chaplins great dictator both are comic attacks fascism but formers is more successful benigni initially accesses emotions his audience through simple comedy which is pleasant mix keaton chaplin romance ensues with his real life wife nicoletta braschi first half this film has been seen by various critics as being inferior second but this is certainly not case first section we follow delightful romance that will eventually lead marriage creation wonderful giosue giorgio cantarini it is first half where audience can laugh loudest delight at immense comedy talent benigni unlike so many films nowadays there is nothing crude or course his is simple innocent humour which is all more effective way he ties together little strand film create comedy elements shows great writing ability mastery timing when it comes their execution screen various incidents related rise anti semitism fascism italy show that there are sinister forces at work which come fore second segment guido benigni moves events tuscany 1939 last year war concentration camp this period he dora braschi have had their son giosue cantanarini five year old greatly reminds me toto cinema paradiso plays equally important role his prospective film though paradisos case it is at beginning movie relationship between two is very similar that jackie coogan charlie chaplin though benigni unlike chaplin keeps best comedy moments guido attempts keep boy horrors what is going this eventually manifests itself as game where aim is score 100 points with winner winning real tank which course appeals young boy comic moments are still present that involving guidos translation rules camp is particularly notable but it becomes somewhat more difficult laugh when we consider gravity what is going emphasis begins shifts we realise that this is film about human spirit above all else guido not only appeals audience due his comedy sheer pleasantness but also way that he loves his family measures that he will go protect them this is certainly no schindlers list but it never pretends be occasionally events seem little contrived but this does seem work films favour however this film avoids tendency hollywood go far over top emotional credibility terms benigni shines like lantern throughout picture showing that he is talent not only comedy terms that far outshines his peers cantanari is delight braschi also plays her part well there is even appearance by magnificent sevens horst buchholz as doctor lessing man who events change worse please dont let fact that it all but italians is foreign language film language itself adds beauty form film much as it did case il postino this has be certainty best foreign language film oscar though something tells me that it will be overlooked other awards as it is italian not mainstream english language picture please see this film make up your own mind it is appealing so many different ways that im sure that you will not be disappointed,0.5175962301587302,0.18950892857142854,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,A Movie About Hope,"Life Is Beautiful takes the premise that love and hope can survive the most trying of conditions, in this case a Nazi concentration camp. Most everyone knows this very popular and honored film, so I won't belabor the story. Briefly, in my humble opinion, this film deserves all the accolades it's been awarded. A near perfect film, my only gripe is that Mr. Benigni's performance could have been more understated, especially the half of the film that's set in the concentration camp. But this is only a slight complaint. For a joyful, life-affirming movie, Life Is Beautiful is tops. But be forewarned, as its principal backdrop of anti-Semitism and Nazi murder, it is not a very happy movie.",movie about hope,life is beautiful takes premise that love hope can survive most trying conditions this case nazi concentration camp most everyone knows this very popular honored film so i wont belabor story briefly my humble opinion this film deserves all accolades its been awarded near perfect film my only gripe is that mr benignis performance could have been more understated especially half film thats set concentration camp but this is only slight complaint joyful life affirming movie life is beautiful is tops but be forewarned as its principal backdrop anti semitism nazi murder it is not very happy movie,0.648076923076923,0.26701923076923073,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.47}"

9.0,The best foreign language film I have ever seen.,"I typically don't care much for sub-titled movies. Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing. So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder. I wanted to hate it. I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people. Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life. Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan. The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke. It's actually funny.Benigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film. There really is. For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible. And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I've ever seen. When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell. He's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.I loved this film. Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars.

10.0,funny and disturbing,"Before I watched this film, I was a bit hesitant because the basic premise sounds so ridiculous--a man who uses humor and imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the holocaust while in a concentration camp! I mean, how can this movie be funny? Is this another ""Hogan's Heroes"" or what, I thought.Well, first, most of the humor in the film occurs BEFORE the internment. This makes sense and allows the movie to be in good taste. I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions with the silly buffoonery of Benigni as he tries to capture the heart of a woman he keeps ""bumping into"". These moments also abound with charm and seem rather reminiscent of the work of Chaplin--lots of physical humor and charm.The second half of the movie does indeed take place in a prison camp. Occasionally, there were some mildly humorous moments but the goal was not a cheap laugh but were desperate attempts to convince the child that he should not give up hope. Despite the ludicrousness of the plot at this point (hiding a little boy in a men's dormitory in a prison camp), the way they explain it works out perfectly and should not offend or diminish from the horrors that were the holocaust.This film, though VERY cleverly written, was carried by Benigni's marvelous acting.

10.0,One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen,"The first time I saw the movie was when I was about seventeen or so, and I never forgot it. The incredibly human characters (such as the doctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. There is so much love in the characters; Dora's love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well as Guido's love for his son. Sure, it's a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, aren't they all a little unrealistic? I've also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. I don't think so; I think that it's only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too ""light"" are cynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. This movie changed my life from the first time I watched it.

7.0,Life is Beautiful,"A film of 2 halves. The first is a joyous lighthearted comedy with Benigni trying everything to woo Braschi. The second half takes a far more serious turn with a Benigni and Braschi (now married) and their young son (Cantarini) send to a concentration camp. Here he tries to protect his son from the horrors by pretending it's all a game, with a real tank going to the winner.A difficult film to define. The first half is a complete joy, with lots of laughs - Benigni's scenes romancing Braschi are wonderful with various plot devices used to great effect including a scene when he tells her he needs a dry hat - hilarious. The second half though is tricky. Benigni manages to maintain a convincing balance between horror and humour, but there's no avoiding, in a world where Schindler's List and The Pianist exist, that the horror is largely played down.It is though a film that leaves you smiling - just - and which reflects perfectly the message in the title of the film. The performances are outstanding with Benigni giving a standout comic turn - like Chaplain, only funnier, with impressive support from Braschi and Cantarini. Not altogether sure Benigni deserved the Oscar though against Hanks in Saving Private Ryan, as glorious though his performance is, you get the impression that this is what he's like in real life. Not to be missed though.",life is beautiful,film 2 halves first is joyous lighthearted comedy with benigni trying everything woo braschi second half takes far more serious turn with benigni braschi now married their young son cantarini send concentration camp here he tries protect his son horrors by pretending its all game with real tank going winner difficult film define first half is complete joy with lots laughs benignis scenes romancing braschi are wonderful with various plot devices used great effect including scene when he tells her he needs dry hat hilarious second half though is tricky benigni manages maintain convincing balance between horror humour but theres no avoiding world where schindlers list pianist exist that horror is largely played down it is though film that leaves you smiling just which reflects perfectly message title film performances are outstanding with benigni giving standout comic turn like chaplain only funnier with impressive support braschi cantarini not altogether sure benigni deserved oscar though against hanks saving private ryan as glorious though his performance is you get impression that this is what hes like real life not be missed though,0.5482766439909298,0.22310657596371883,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Slapstick humor in a holocaust film?,"You betcha. But it's not as offensive as you think. In fact, it's not offensive at all. It's a powerful and moving film about the power of family and what one man will do when that family is threatened. The plot is as follows: after Germans attack Italy, Guido and his family are forced into a concentration camp. Guido spends most of the rest of the film desperately trying to convince his young son that the holocaust is nothing but a game- and that the child has to keep out of sight in order to win. He promises him that the winner will earn a full size tank- and the boy does get a tank at the end of the film, just not in the way he thinks he will. The first hour or so is pure slapstick/romantic comedy, and the second hour or so is moving and heartbreaking- with touches of humor to(I assume) keep the audience from becoming too depressed or disturbed. I was amazed at how it could dramatically shift from comedy to drama so quickly. Try to watch this film without crying.

8.0,"Visually stunning, but uneven. For me the second half was better than the first","Before I eventually saw this film, I was not sure whether I was going to like it or not. While in general it is very highly regarded, there have been those who have said it is overrated or whatever. Just for the record, I did like the movie very much. It is uneven, and there were parts that didn't work as well as intended, but this is a brave and affectionate realisation of life during the Holocaust. I asked myself after watching Life is Beautiful, is it really overrated. Well, maybe a tad, but I can really see why people like this movie.So what didn't make this film perfect? Well, as I have stated at least twice already, it is uneven. And in my humble opinion, the second half was better than the first. I just want to clarify that I didn't hate the first half. Some of it is very funny, but some of the slapstick humour didn't work as well as it should, namely eggs breaking on people's heads. It also works very hard, to provide charm. That is perfectly acceptable, but because there was a lot of charm in the performances and the production values it felt slightly overdone. Though I will say that Benigni's tribute to comedy greats like Charlie Chaplin and Groucho Marx was inspired.The film changes tone to a more poignant, compelling and harrowing second half, that I think was much needed. While the character of Guido ""amusingly"" tries to convince his son Giosue that life in the concentration isn't so bad, the second half's tone has a lot of poignancy. Most notably Guido and Giosue trying to communicate to Dora over the loudspeaker, and the ending did have me in tears.That said, there are a lot of truly good things about Life is Beautiful. For one thing, it is sumptuously filmed. The costumes look amazing and the Italian landscapes look breathtaking. (If there is one place that I would love, love, LOVE to go to it is Italy, not only for the food but for the opera as well.) The story is an effective and affectionate one, about a Jewish man who falls in love with the help of his humour, but has to do the same to protect his son in the Nazi concentration camp. The quality of the script, I saw the Italian version with English subtitles, is thoroughly decent, and hits more than it misses.The performances are excellent in general. Roberto Benigni, one of Italy's favourite funny men, gives a admirable performance. He does overact at times in the first half but he appears a lot more subdued in the second. And I also thought he did a better job acting than he did directing. His direction once or twice in this film was a tad stodgy. Nicoletta Braschi is just stunning as Dora, she looked amazing in this movie and was solid in terms of acting. Giorgio Cantarini didn't always convince as Giosue though, there were times when he comes across as whiny and maybe I am being unfair but I have seen better child performances.All in all, beautiful to watch, and a nice story. It is very pleasant to watch with a compelling and poignant second half, but there are flaws that bring it down from what could have been outstanding to just a film worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox",visually stunning but uneven me second half was better than first,before i eventually saw this film i was not sure whether i was going like it or not while general it is very highly regarded there have been those who have said it is overrated or whatever just record i did like movie very much it is uneven there were parts that didnt work as well as intended but this is brave affectionate realisation life during holocaust i asked myself after watching life is beautiful is it really overrated well maybe tad but i can really see why people like this movie so what didnt make this film perfect well as i have stated at least twice already it is uneven my humble opinion second half was better than first i just want clarify that i didnt hate first half some it is very funny but some slapstick humour didnt work as well as it should namely eggs breaking peoples heads it also works very hard provide charm that is perfectly acceptable but because there was lot charm performances production values it felt slightly overdone though i will say that benignis tribute comedy greats like charlie chaplin groucho marx was inspired film changes tone more poignant compelling harrowing second half that i think was much needed while character guido amusingly tries convince his son giosue that life concentration isnt so bad second halfs tone has lot poignancy most notably guido giosue trying communicate dora over loudspeaker ending did have me tears that said there are lot truly good things about life is beautiful one thing it is sumptuously filmed costumes look amazing italian landscapes look breathtaking if there is one place that i would love love love go it is italy not only food but opera as well story is effective affectionate one about jewish man who falls love with help his humour but has do same protect his son nazi concentration camp quality script i saw italian version with english subtitles is thoroughly decent hits more than it misses performances are excellent general roberto benigni one italys favourite funny men gives admirable performance he does overact at times first half but he appears lot more subdued second i also thought he did better job acting than he did directing his direction once or twice this film was tad stodgy nicoletta braschi is just stunning as dora she looked amazing this movie was solid terms acting giorgio cantarini didnt always convince as giosue though there were times when he comes across as whiny maybe i am being unfair but i have seen better child performances all all beautiful watch nice story it is very pleasant watch with compelling poignant second half but there are flaws that bring it down what could have been outstanding just film worth watching 8 10 bethany cox,0.4904546070460706,0.21709281842818431,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,A beautiful film... but not an entirely perfect one,"When I first saw this film, I was told up front that the first full hour of the film, the first half, was all slapstick comedy and character development, and that the second half was more serious and important. I prepared myself mentally for the first half, but I was still surprised by how annoying the gags and jokes were. We're talking cake-in-face, fall-over, slip-on-banana humor. For one full hour. At the end of the first half of this film, I was thinking ""this had better get better very soon..."" And it did. Right then and there. From the very beginning of the second half, the serious mood enters. And it doesn't take long for even the most average minded viewer to realize that the first half of humor and character development was important. It was important for us to ease into a less tense mood, to make the important subject strike even harder, and for us to get to know the characters, to make us care more about what happens to them. I've just finished seeing it for the second time, and I've come to realize that this film is not entirely perfect, as I felt just after seeing it through first time. It does have its flaws, though there aren't many of them. The first half, and some parts of the second half, are heavy on humor, which some will mistake for making fun of the subject(which is almost a crime), or trying to make it seem less important. I don't believe this to be true, it's just a retelling with a more positive message; yes, people do horrible, inhumane things sometimes... but after all, there is beauty, too. The first half will also deter some viewers who will enjoy the second half much more. The plot is very good, though slightly unrealistic. The acting is pretty much all flawless, even in the child actors. The characters are well-written and interesting. The humor is more acceptable in the second part, because it's more toned down and not trying way too hard to get a quick laugh out of the audience. All in all, a great film which anyone and everyone should see at least once during their life... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll realize that, in the end, Life Is Beautiful. I recommend this to just about anyone, but I know that not everyone will enjoy it equally. A near-perfect film.

8.0,Marvelous tale about a likable Jewish protecting his son and wife from horrifying concentration camp,"Wonderful fable plenty of amazing fantasy, lively comedy and sad tragedy . This is a poignant and moving fable about a sacrifice to save a son and a wife . It's an unforgettable story formed by two halves that proves imagination, family and love conquer all ; as Benigni's focus is on the love between daddy , mummy and son . The first part results to be an Italian comedy style , the second is horror along with humor . It concerns upon Guido (Roberto Benigni, a magnificent rubber-faced funny man), a Jewish man who has a wonderful romance with the help of his humour, but must use that same quality to protect his son in a Nazi death camp . He's a madcap romantic man and women wish him . But he falls in love with Dora (Benigni's real-life sweetie Nicoletta Braschi). Every day Guido dreams of marrying her , under Nicola Piovani score . When the Second World War spontaneously breaks out , he and his family is imprisoned at concentration camp . Guido is determined to save his lover and son (Cantarini) from dangers around them . His effort sometimes is pure fantasy , though with ruse he pull off more impetus to keep his son and accomplishes feats no man could realistically execute . Guido fabricates an elaborated game to convince his child that the whole ordeal is an endurance proof to be won with prizes forthcoming , as it turns out to be a special contest to win a tank.This is a story about love , war and sacrifice , well starred and directed by Roberto Benigni who develops a fire-line between comedy and tragedy . Inventive gags and wacky humor are splendidly proceeded . At first consideration , the theme of a feel-good holocaust comedy war was a non-sense . However , Benigni doesn't describe a holocaust film but rather a tale of endurance of family love . Benigni tirelessly maintains the humorous ingenuity, even as the horror war escalates. Actor and director Benigni shapes simultaneously haunting and hilarious comedy out of the tragedy of Nazi concentration camp . In a especially humorous scene , Guido translates a guard's barking at the inmates as furthers clarification of the rules of game . The picture is divided into two parts , the first half deals with an entertaining boy-meets-girl tale , a light-weight comedy in which Guido relentlessly pursues Dora ; the second half shifts and depicts the horrors of the concentration camps . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries as the Spanish Marisa Paredes , Lidia Alfonsi and Horst Buchhold as a Nazi doctor . The film displays an emotive musical score by Nicola Piovani, who deservedly had Oscar winner . Furthermore , it won Academy Award to Foreign film and of course to Benigni ; Roberto Benigni's Oscar for best actor marked only the second time that an actor had directed himself in an Academy Award winning performance , the other was Laurence Olivier for Hamlet . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli . Effective and appropriate production design by the veteran Danilo Donati . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Benigni. He's a good comedy director (Monster, Johnny Toothpick, Little devil) with some flop (Pinoccio) and usual actor for Jim Jarmusch (Coffee and cigarettes, Night of Earth, Down by law). Rating : Better than average .

10.0,Bon Giorno Principezza!!!!,"Contains Spoiler Every once in a while a movie comes along which makes you question the kind of man you are. How do you handle situations? If you were put in the same situation, Would you come out of it smiling? Do you have the courage? Guido (Benigni) did. Life is beautiful charms you right from the opening shot of the beautiful Italian countryside. It takes you into the life of Guido, a young Italian Jewish Waiter who has a beautiful way of looking at things. he never seems to look at anmything negatively, in fact, his frivolous view to life is what makes you sit riveted throughout. I don't think he's delusional, he is a very serious man, and he sees the gravity of situations in his life, but he doesn't want the people around him to feel it, hence his ever-smiling, effervescent demeanour. It all seems like a fairy tale. His landing into the school as the impostor school inspector and lecture on the virtues of the navel... His galloping down into the ballroom on the horse and whisking his bride away towards a happy life... His superspeed bike ride down the town square... things that we all dream of. An untouched innocence. The movie takes a dramatic turn when he finds himself in a concentration camp with his son... His made up story of how the camp is a game and the father-son team are the leading competitors... An unmatched courage. Not one to cry in movies as a rule, I found myself alone at home one day, and when the boy is hidden in the little box, looking at his father being led away at gun point, getting scared... and then, the father doing what he usually does to reassure the boy that the situation is not as serious as it looks... the clown march... I felt tears roll down my cheeks. And then, i started sniffing... after a while, the sniffs turn into sobs, and ultimately, when his father is dead, and the boy sees the American tank coming towards him, the elation in his eyes, the jubilation at winning first prize... it turned the sobs into a full fledged howl. Thats when i got the message... That's when the maginitude of the sacrifice made by the father in an effort to protect his son hit me like a thunderbolt and hasn't left me since. Thats when you realize that life is all about loving, and protecting and cherishiong your loved ones. and despite all the troubles, the despair and the danger that one may face, Life is...

9.0,Shows a Lighter Edge To A Tragic Event In History,"I never thought the day would come when a movie centred during the Holocaust would be provided with humour. The Holocaust was anything but funny then and now as thousands of Europeans of Jewish faith were killed off mainly towards fear, paranoia, economical insecurity and just plain hatred. But once in a while towards sadness, we can open our hearts and try to survive the grimness with some humour to raise our spirit. And that is exactly what actor/director/writer Roberto Benigni succeeds in ""Life is Beautiful"". It's a refreshing break from the graphic and and disturbing images that has haunted the theatres past and present like Spielberg's ""Schildler's List"" or Polanski's ""The Pianist"" as we look to a more brighter side of the Holocaust mainly toward the humour of the leading protagonist, Guido Orefice (Benigni).When it first came out and it was listed as a comedy, I thought it was just too surreal to be true. I mean nothing funny ever happened in the Holocaust. And film adaptations have been quite demonstrative at that. In those troubled times, lives were lost, families were separated, people were cold, starving fear and doubt was on the minds of Europeans Jewish and non-Jewish. at the time. But Benigni showed his mastery in front and behind the camera that we can enjoy the goodness of life, even in times of uncertainty because we only live once and we must enjoy it while we can.Benigni was not the only person who made this film all the more worthwhile. Nicoletta Braschi turns in a wonderful performance as a Catholic girl who loves her husband regardless of what religion he practises. A grand portion of scenes demonstrates just how pointless racism is and the best example is set in the schoolroom scene.Concentration camps are one of the worst establishments anyone would ever dream of entering and yet in this movie we can enjoy a chuckle. In one scene, Guido persuades the soldiers as he defends his son as a ploy to prevent his son from further dire circumstances. While we laugh as he tries to weasel his way out from further punishment, we are still aware and concerned about the welfare of Guido and his young son and the dangers they are encountering.The fearful and depressing effects of the Holocaust is exhibited in brief moments of sad truths that weave into Guido's detailed fantasies. But you never see him fall victim to disparity. His wild imagination and his determination are the only weapons of protection he utilizes to keep his family and his son in tact. The remarkable story of love and tenderness is worthy enough for everyone to see. This movie should be cherished for a long time to come.",shows lighter edge tragic event history,i never thought day would come when movie centred during holocaust would be provided with humour holocaust was anything but funny then now as thousands europeans jewish faith were killed off mainly towards fear paranoia economical insecurity just plain hatred but once while towards sadness we can open our hearts try survive grimness with some humour raise our spirit that is exactly what actor director writer roberto benigni succeeds life is beautiful its refreshing break graphic disturbing images that has haunted theatres past present like spielbergs schildlers list or polanskis pianist as we look more brighter side holocaust mainly toward humour leading protagonist guido orefice benigni when it first came out it was listed as comedy i thought it was just too surreal be true i mean nothing funny ever happened holocaust film adaptations have been quite demonstrative at that those troubled times lives were lost families were separated people were cold starving fear doubt was minds europeans jewish non jewish at time but benigni showed his mastery front behind camera that we can enjoy goodness life even times uncertainty because we only live once we must enjoy it while we can benigni was not only person who made this film all more worthwhile nicoletta braschi turns wonderful performance as catholic girl who loves her husband regardless what religion he practises grand portion scenes demonstrates just how pointless racism is best example is set schoolroom scene concentration camps are one worst establishments anyone would ever dream entering yet this movie we can enjoy chuckle one scene guido persuades soldiers as he defends his son as ploy prevent his son further dire circumstances while we laugh as he tries weasel his way out further punishment we are still aware concerned about welfare guido his young son dangers they are encountering fearful depressing effects holocaust is exhibited brief moments sad truths that weave into guidos detailed fantasies but you never see him fall victim disparity his wild imagination his determination are only weapons protection he utilizes keep his family his son tact remarkable story love tenderness is worthy enough everyone see this movie should be cherished long time come,0.566852068696331,0.08444663260237029,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Roberto Benigni is a GENIUS,"""Life is Beautiful"" is more than a masterpiece. It is possibly THE most incredibly wonderful movie that exists. Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni) is a Jewish waiter in 1930s Italy. He has managed to hide his ethnic background, although he is fully aware of the anti-Semitism around him (one man has sons named Adolf and Benito). To counter Mussolini's nationalism, he goes to a school to ""prove"" that the Italians are a superior race: he shows off his bellybutton. After some flings with ""principesa"" Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), the two of them get married and have a son named Giosue (called Joshua in the subtitles).A few years later, the Nazis are rounding up all the Jews in town, including Guido and Giosue (Dora demands to be taken also). But Guido has the most imaginative plan: he tells Giosue that they are playing a game. In what may be the movie's most surprising scene, they enter a barracks where everyone is wearing those suits that we've seen in footage of concentration camps, and Guido ""translates"" for the Nazi guard: he announces how they are participating in this game to see who can get the most points, and you lose points for being a crybaby, asking to see your mommy, or asking for food. You are quite literally assuming that he can't pull it off, but he does masterfully.Throughout the whole movie, you keep expecting that he's eventually going to go over the edge, but he never does.

3.0,Have you all lost your bloody minds?!,"In the immortal - although very paraphrased - words of Lieutenant Dane: ""*Life* is *beautiful*? Well, kiss my crippled ass!""The first hour or so of this movie felt like being invited to a fancy dinner party in some beautiful restaurant in Toscana and having to spend the entire evening next to some socially challenged, annoying moron with delusions of charm and an inability to ever shut up. The second hour of the film is basically identical except now it's set in a concentration camp. So basically, the film is two hours of unfunny jokes with a Holocaust backdrop thrown in to make it critic-proof. How sad. Imagine a six-year old trapped in the body of a middle-aged Italian man on a steady diet of Red Bull and Ecstasy - that's how I'd describe Roberto Benigni's ""characterization"" of the film's star, Guido. He even has trouble stopping himself from laughing at his own wit at times (although referring to Benigni's humour as ""wit"" is like calling Xzibit an accomplished thespian. I'm not even sure it can be called ""humour"" - it's almost insulting to such masters of the genre as Adam Sandler or Owen Wilson). I guess this is how you win an Oscar these days. If you want to see a truly good performance from a comedian playing a foreigner, look no further than Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat"" which was released last year (I'm just telling you this in case you've been living under a rock for some time, or if you're from Ohio - in that case, I'm sorry). At least in that film, the main character was *supposed* to be mildly retarded, while in Benigni's movie the lead makes you unsure if you should laugh or cry as he hogs up precious screen time with his oh-so-hilarious antics. Sacha Baron Cohen was, by the way, almost completely ignored by the Academy. Go figure. The film's plot is about one man trying to make life less unbearable for a little doe-eyed kid throughout their stay in a concentration camp. They don't arrive at the concentration camp, however, before one excruciating hour of Benigni's constant mugging and a love story that rings so false it would make even Michael Bay retch. The second hour of the film is considerably less light-hearted than the first but just as boring, repetitive and unrealistic. In reality, a guy like Guido wouldn't have survived a week in a concentration camp. Chances are if the Nazis didn't kill him first, the other Jews would have, if only to shut him up for once. Just how the hell did Guido manage to keep Doe-Eyed Child Actor hidden from the Nazis for so long? The film can't possibly be supposed to be serious - it's too implausible - and it's not nearly funny enough to be a comedy. What a mess.The film only hints at the true horrors of the Holocaust and never really shocks or disturbs you. It doesn't say anything that we didn't already know about this tragedy and the unfunny jokes only make it more offensive. Ask yourself this: does Jim Carrey have anything to do in a film about the Holocaust? I thought not. Does a second-rate hack with only a shred of Carrey's comic talent but with the same urge to mug and overact have anything to do in a film about the Holocaust?? I think not!All this aside, the film is competently made in most other aspects, with some beautiful scenery and a not-too-awful score. Other than that this is an embarrassing and inexplicably acclaimed ego-trip. The only truly funny thing about this disaster is how everyone is calling it a masterpiece and actually believe that the Oscars were well deserved! Oh well, people loved ""Crash"", too (Paul Haggis' 'RACISM SUCKS' epic, not the one where James Spader has sex with a leg wound). Honestly, this film is so corny I'm surprised aliens didn't etch secret messages in it with their rayguns. How can you hand out a Best ""Foreign"" Picture Oscar to a flick that ends with a freeze frame of a mother hugging her child? Seriously, a FREEZE FRAME? Give me a break or some insulin because this is too much sugar for me. In conclusion, this film is manipulative, completely unrealistic, offensively stupid and features one of the least likely love stories ever. And it's unfunny. Dreadfully, hopelessly, comatose-ly unfunny. This coming from a person who could find something to laugh at in ""Scary Movie 2"". Trust me, I laugh very easily at various kinds of comedies, and ""Life is Beautiful"" is easily one of the worst movies ever to win an Oscar. And please don't call me insensitive, heartless, or soulless... I don't call you a tasteless, easily manipulated sheep, now do I?Finally, I'd just like to say that Benigni has one of the scariest smiles I've ever seen. Think Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise and Rip Torn combined times a hundred. Every time his mouth twisted into one of his well-practiced, sh!t-eating grins (and this happens almost every twenty seconds throughout the movie, so don't worry, you won't miss it) I had an overwhelming urge to run from the room screaming. Avoid this movie.",have you all lost your bloody minds,immortal although very paraphrased words lieutenant dane life is beautiful well kiss my crippled ass first hour or so this movie felt like being invited fancy dinner party some beautiful restaurant toscana having spend entire evening next some socially challenged annoying moron with delusions charm inability ever shut up second hour film is basically identical except now its set concentration camp so basically film is two hours unfunny jokes with holocaust backdrop thrown make it critic proof how sad imagine six year old trapped body middle aged italian man steady diet red bull ecstasy thats how id describe roberto benignis characterization films star guido he even has trouble stopping himself laughing at his own wit at times although referring benignis humour as wit is like calling xzibit accomplished thespian im not even sure it can be called humour its almost insulting such masters genre as adam sandler or owen wilson i guess this is how you win oscar these days if you want see truly good performance comedian playing foreigner look no further than sacha baron cohens borat which was released last year im just telling you this case youve been living under rock some time or if youre ohio that case im sorry at least that film main character was supposed be mildly retarded while benignis movie lead makes you unsure if you should laugh or cry as he hogs up precious screen time with his oh so hilarious antics sacha baron cohen was by way almost completely ignored by academy go figure films plot is about one man trying make life less unbearable little doe eyed kid throughout their stay concentration camp they dont arrive at concentration camp however before one excruciating hour benignis constant mugging love story that rings so false it would make even michael bay retch second hour film is considerably less light hearted than first but just as boring repetitive unrealistic reality guy like guido wouldnt have survived week concentration camp chances are if nazis didnt kill him first other jews would have if only shut him up once just how hell did guido manage keep doe eyed child actor hidden nazis so long film cant possibly be supposed be serious its too implausible its not nearly funny enough be comedy what mess film only hints at true horrors holocaust never really shocks or disturbs you it doesnt say anything that we didnt already know about this tragedy unfunny jokes only make it more offensive ask yourself this does jim carrey have anything do film about holocaust i thought not does second rate hack with only shred carreys comic talent but with same urge mug overact have anything do film about holocaust i think not all this aside film is competently made most other aspects with some beautiful scenery not too awful score other than that this is embarrassing inexplicably acclaimed ego trip only truly funny thing about this disaster is how everyone is calling it masterpiece actually believe that oscars were well deserved oh well people loved crash too paul haggis racism sucks epic not one where james spader has sex with leg wound honestly this film is so corny im surprised aliens didnt etch secret messages it with their rayguns how can you hand out best foreign picture oscar flick that ends with freeze frame mother hugging her child seriously freeze frame give me break or some insulin because this is too much sugar me conclusion this film is manipulative completely unrealistic offensively stupid features one least likely love stories ever its unfunny dreadfully hopelessly comatose ly unfunny this coming person who could find something laugh at scary movie 2 trust me i laugh very easily at various kinds comedies life is beautiful is easily one worst movies ever win oscar please dont call me insensitive heartless or soulless i dont call you tasteless easily manipulated sheep now do i finally id just like say that benigni has one scariest smiles ive ever seen think jack nicholson tom cruise rip torn combined times hundred every time his mouth twisted into one his well practiced sh t eating grins this happens almost every twenty seconds throughout movie so dont worry you wont miss it i had overwhelming urge run room screaming avoid this movie,0.5794132917964693,0.0026090342679127737,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Begnigni è Genio (Begnigni's a Genius),"On seeing this film, my first thought (after wiping the tears from my eyes) was ""My god, he pulled it off."" I can think of only one other director who's dealt with the Holocaust in a comedic film and done it with any depth, and his name was Chaplin -- and ""The Great Dictator"" was made before the horrors of the Final Solution were known to the world. Chaplin didn't have to deal with that baggage. Begnigni did, and did so brilliantly.The film begins as an earthy comedy as only the Italians can do and ends as a dark tragedy with a hopeful note -- and the transition from one to the other is seamless. In fact, the latter half of the film would not work without all the meticulous set-ups of the first half. That we get to meet Begnigni's character, see his world and hopes and dreams, makes it all only more poignant as they are threatened with destruction. On top of this, the first half of the film is reminiscent of ""Amaracord"" (one of my favorite films) in appearance -- possibly a result of it being set in the same period, possibly intentional. (Begnigni pulls off at least one homage to ""The Bicycle Thief,"" among other films, during the first act and a half.)Anyway... I really debated with myself before seeing the film, thinking, ""Hm. A comedy... about the Holocaust. Do I want to deal with that tonight?"" I went, I saw, and the film conquered me. Fellini made me suspect that the Italians might be film geniuses... ""La Vita è Bella"" made me realize they are film gods...See it.

4.0,The most overrated Film of all time!,"I will never understand why this film and the star (Roberto Benigni) were/are so highly praised. This film is mediocre and plain pathetic at what it tried to do. I felt that it was only highly praised because everyone was sooo in love with Benigni and his ridiculous antics! I will never understand how this won any Oscars, or what exactly made this a great film. Now some of my favorite films are those that deal with WWII (""Downfall"" for example) and the Holocaust. (""Schindlers List"" stomps on this.) I appreciate what was trying to be said about the inhumanity of the Holocaust, and the fathers love for his son in keeping the truth from him. I just felt that it was very repetitive and didn't say or do anything that hasn't been said or done before in film. It is still rated in the Top 100 a decade later so there is obviously those that think this is still an excellent film. I would hope that people would watch it again and see if they still feel that this is really one of the best films of all time. I just can't see how this is rated in the Top 250 when there are so many other better films that are just out of it. Doesn't it make you wonder why we have never heard of this film really since? For that matter have we even heard of Roberto Benigni since? I feel that so many of these ratings are because everyone likes HIM so well, and are therefore biased on their ratings.",most overrated film all time,i will never understand why this film star roberto benigni were are so highly praised this film is mediocre plain pathetic at what it tried do i felt that it was only highly praised because everyone was sooo love with benigni his ridiculous antics i will never understand how this won any oscars or what exactly made this great film now some my favorite films are those that deal with wwii downfall example holocaust schindlers list stomps this i appreciate what was trying be said about inhumanity holocaust fathers love his son keeping truth him i just felt that it was very repetitive didnt say or do anything that hasnt been said or done before film it is still rated top 100 decade later so there is obviously those that think this is still excellent film i would hope that people would watch it again see if they still feel that this is really one best films all time i just cant see how this is rated top 250 when there are so many other better films that are just out it doesnt it make you wonder why we have never heard this film really since that matter have we even heard roberto benigni since i feel that so many these ratings are because everyone likes him so well are therefore biased their ratings,0.559120879120879,0.22201465201465204,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.17}"
