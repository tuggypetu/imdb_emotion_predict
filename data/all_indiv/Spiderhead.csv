6.0,Gets the minimum out of the concept,"Your enjoyment levels of 'Spiderhead' are going to require some suspensions of disbelief. You're going to have to accept Chris Hemsworth as a scientist, you're going to have to accept Miles Teller as a prisoner and you're going to have to accept possibly the most unrealistic prison environment ever put to screen. If you can get past those things you should have a decent time.The premise was a bit of a let down for me. In theory there are some interesting concepts stemming from it that they could've explored, but they seemed intent on not straying too far. The script really does get the bare minimum out of the idea.Teller and Hemsworth are what keep this afloat. Even if their casting may seem a little silly, their charisma makes up for it. At least one of the them is on screen in every scene. I can see this film totally falling flat without their star-power in the lead roles.I didn't hate this film, I just wanted more. There was a point where I thought it was actually setting itself up nicely to have a dark and twisted turn. But it never came and what played out was pretty forgettable and uninspired. It's not a terrible watch but don't go in expecting anything game-changing. 6/10.",gets minimum out concept,your enjoyment levels spiderhead are going require some suspensions disbelief youre going have accept chris hemsworth as scientist youre going have accept miles teller as prisoner youre going have accept possibly most unrealistic prison environment ever put screen if you can get past those things you should have decent time premise was bit let down me theory there are some interesting concepts stemming it that they couldve explored but they seemed intent not straying too far script really does get bare minimum out idea teller hemsworth are what keep this afloat even if their casting may seem little silly their charisma makes up it at least one them is screen every scene i can see this film totally falling flat without their star power lead roles i didnt hate this film i just wanted more there was point where i thought it was actually setting itself up nicely have dark twisted turn but it never came what played out was pretty forgettable uninspired its not terrible watch but dont go expecting anything game changing 6 10,0.579059829059829,-0.05389957264957265,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"

5.0,Doesn't make the most of its riveting premise! [+52%],"Spiderhead banks heavily on its lead performers, and both Hemsworth and Teller deliver the goods when the plot struggles to. Very early on, you smell a lighter version of Ex-Machina (replace the robot with mind-control drugs), with several random tonal shifts. The writers (Rhett Rheese & Paul Wernick) are known for tickling the funny bone, but I think this film would have benefited from a more serious, psychological approach - which, credit where it's due - it did to some extent. The romantic subplot, while nice to see, ended up being exploited (such a clich√©) as expected. The conclusion isn't all that exciting, because by then, Spiderhead has fully embraced its weirdness and is unfortunately stuck between making viewers care and giving closure to the plot.",doesnt make most its riveting premise,spiderhead banks heavily its lead performers both hemsworth teller deliver goods when plot struggles very early you smell lighter version ex machina replace robot with mind control drugs with several random tonal shifts writers rhett rheese paul wernick are known tickling funny bone but i think this film would have benefited more serious psychological approach which credit where its due it did some extent romantic subplot while nice see ended up being exploited such clich as expected conclusion isnt all that exciting because by then spiderhead has fully embraced its weirdness is unfortunately stuck between making viewers care giving closure plot,0.5724509803921569,0.06009803921568628,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.42}"
5.0,at least the drug names are funny,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""We are changing the world!"" These days, those words tend to be more chilling than hopeful. More cautionary than exciting. Spoken a few times by scientist Steve Abnesti (Chris Hemsworth), those words have long ago lost the intended impact with his assistant Mark (Mark Paguio).Steve is the warden of a high-tech experimental prison where the convicts have agreed to participate in drug studies in exchange for a relaxed/comfortable environment and the hope of early release. In fact, these folks are guinea pigs for mind-altering drugs controlled through a surgically attached mechanism on their lower back. We recognize that Steve is smart because he wears wire-rimmed glasses, and we recognize his villainous intent because of his smarmy nature and impossible to trust false charm.Much of the focus here is on Jeff (the very talented Miles Teller) who is serving time due to his responsibility in a tragic car accident. Steve tests each of the drugs on Jeff, and each test requires Jeff to ""acknowledge"" his consent ... as if it's his choice to see what happens with the next round of mind-bending. The drugs have hilariously descriptive names: ""Verbaluce"" forces one to speak their mind, ""Phobica"" causes paranoia and fear, ""Laffodil"" generates uncontrollable laughter, and ""Luvactin"" ... well, you get the idea.Beyond the drugs, Jeff finds a soulmate in Lizzy (Jurnee Smollett) and ultimately, Steve pits the two against each other in order to elevate the drug testing and human behavior to extreme levels. The film carries a science fiction label, but mind-altering drugs are as much a part of the past and present as they are the future. Any promise shown in the early stages of the film have long evaporated by the insipid final act that pits Jeff and Lizzy against Steve and the other convicts.The basis for the film is a George Saunders short story originally published in The New Yorker entitled, ""Escape from Spiderhead"". It has been adapted for the screen by DEADPOOL and ZOMBIELAND co-writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Unfortunately, the wit and cleverness of those two films is never flashed here ... except for the use of Thomas Dolby's song, ""She Blinded Me with Science."" Other late 70's and 80's songs provide only cringing, as they weren't even that enjoyable at their peak. The director of this film, Joseph Kosinski, is riding high right now with his ""other"" film currently setting box office records. Perhaps you've heard of it: TOP GUN: MAVERICK. It's unusual for a director to have two films out simultaneously, but the pandemic has caused quite a few oddities. I will ""acknowledge"" that the execution of this story is quite disappointing.Releases globally on Netflix beginning June 17, 2022.",at least drug names are funny,greetings again darkness we are changing world these days those words tend be more chilling than hopeful more cautionary than exciting spoken few times by scientist steve abnesti chris hemsworth those words have long ago lost intended impact with his assistant mark mark paguio steve is warden high tech experimental prison where convicts have agreed participate drug studies exchange relaxed comfortable environment hope early release fact these folks are guinea pigs mind altering drugs controlled through surgically attached mechanism their lower back we recognize that steve is smart because he wears wire rimmed glasses we recognize his villainous intent because his smarmy nature impossible trust false charm much focus here is jeff very talented miles teller who is serving time due his responsibility tragic car accident steve tests each drugs jeff each test requires jeff acknowledge his consent as if its his choice see what happens with next round mind bending drugs have hilariously descriptive names verbaluce forces one speak their mind phobica causes paranoia fear laffodil generates uncontrollable laughter luvactin well you get idea beyond drugs jeff finds soulmate lizzy jurnee smollett ultimately steve pits two against each other order elevate drug testing human behavior extreme levels film carries science fiction label but mind altering drugs are as much part past present as they are future any promise shown early stages film have long evaporated by insipid final act that pits jeff lizzy against steve other convicts basis film is george saunders short story originally published new yorker entitled escape spiderhead it has been adapted screen by deadpool zombieland co writers rhett reese paul wernick unfortunately wit cleverness those two films is never flashed here except use thomas dolbys song she blinded me with science other late 70s 80s songs provide only cringing as they werent even that enjoyable at their peak director this film joseph kosinski is riding high right now with his other film currently setting box office records perhaps youve heard it top gun maverick its unusual director have two films out simultaneously but pandemic has caused quite few oddities i will acknowledge that execution this story is quite disappointing releases globally netflix beginning june 17 2022,0.5185214785214785,0.01682109557109557,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
4.0,Chris Hemsworth is miscast in Netflix's botched drugs experiment,"The result is a movie that is less thought-provoking and more aggressively lame.

9.0,Surprisingly meaningful and flowing!,"As someone who has a great interest in human emotions and sci-fi, I quite enjoyed this movie and did not understand how the time passed by when watching it. I assume the rating is only low due to not many people seeing the film yet, it deserves definitely a high score!First of all, the acting is done by highly skilled people and with these actors, it would be very challenging to bring out a movie that would not be enjoyable even if the script wasn't good. Chris Hemsworth plays the narcissistic, psychopathic guy in such a great way in this movie that proves he does not owe his reputation to his looks. Anyone that knows psychology would know that there are very subtle ways in how the real-world harming people pretend to be one of the good guys, how they mimic real human emotions when they do not actually feel empathy and so on like others and I'm impressed by how those were shown in this movie instead of the actor playing a shallow, fake villain character in most of those movies that get rated super high.This is a special movie that actually carries a very deep meaning for those that are able to understand it. It's written very cleverly to show the potential harm of the feelings of guilt and shame on people's own selves when we allow those feelings to grow and stay with us. It shows that people would only allow the narcissists, the psychopaths find and harm them if they feel guilty for long enough, if they abandon themselves and feel a lack of love in their lives. When the two characters accept each other for who they are and what mistakes they have done in their past, and still love each other, it helps them heal their feelings of guilt and shame and eventually leads to their freedom. This is what this movie is about.I, for one, get the deepened meaning of this script, this movie and thank everyone for their efforts.
