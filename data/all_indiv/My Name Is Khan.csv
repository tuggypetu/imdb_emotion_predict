9,Great,"My name is Khan tells story of Muslim people living in US before and after the 9/11 tragedy. Although the movie is bold and quite a breakthrough in Bollywood landscape, it still doesn't do justice and overall subjective. Sharukh Khan is a great actor, he played an autistic Muslim who travel the continent with one mission, to meet the president and to clarify (based on his wife request) that not all Muslims are terrorist, obviously not him nor his dead son, victim caused by the race riot. I liked him, he gave honest and thrilling acting - a solid reason just to see the movie. Kajol, the dark beauty is also good, I used to love her but she kinda over-reacted at some scene and leave me cringe on my seat. But the chemistry of this two lead is undeniable, dare I say it's more 'real' than any Hollywood romantic couple on screen. Like I mention earlier, My name is Khan is a breakthrough but at the end of the movie you get a mixed feeling, that is it's subjective and not satisfying enough. But, taking in hand a very sensitive matter I do appreciate the director, Karan Johar from his 'escape' of the comfort zone and direct a delicate project. 9/10.",great,my name is khan tells story muslim people living us before after 9 11 tragedy although movie is bold quite breakthrough bollywood landscape it still doesnt do justice overall subjective sharukh khan is great actor he played autistic muslim who travel continent with one mission meet president clarify based his wife request that not all muslims are terrorist obviously not him nor his dead son victim caused by race riot i liked him he gave honest thrilling acting solid reason just see movie kajol dark beauty is also good i used love her but she kinda over reacted at some scene leave me cringe my seat but chemistry this two lead is undeniable dare i say its more real than any hollywood romantic couple screen like i mention earlier my name is khan is breakthrough but at end movie you get mixed feeling that is its subjective not satisfying enough but taking hand very sensitive matter i do appreciate director karan johar his escape comfort zone direct delicate project 9 10,0.5217948717948718,0.16685897435897437,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10,A movie from the heart.,"I saw this with my family in a theatre. Superb film. Found the movie to b a bit drag at times. No overacting by Srk this time. I ain't no fan of Srk but in this movie he was decent. He got into the character this time. Kajol was good. The flood scenes were a bit cheesy n unnecessary. Nonetheless a decent watch. It deals with racism, loss, stigma about a particular community, communal hatred, hope, perseverance. If you want your life to be rocked go see it. A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don't be put off because it is an Indian film, this is much better than ""copycat BARFI"" and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed.",movie heart,i saw this with my family theatre superb film found movie b bit drag at times no overacting by srk this time i aint no fan srk but this movie he was decent he got into character this time kajol was good flood scenes were bit cheesy n unnecessary nonetheless decent watch it deals with racism loss stigma about particular community communal hatred hope perseverance if you want your life be rocked go see it really wonderful film which should not be missed dont be put off because it is indian film this is much better than copycat barfi much more worthy oscar nomination which it has missed,0.6864583333333334,0.29444444444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.22}"
7,Mr. and Mrs. Khan,"My Name Is Khan is without a doubt Karan Johar's most accomplished work to date - powerful, moving and involving. Johar, not a particularly good director, seems to have learnt a lot from the feedback he must have got for his previous films. At times it was difficult to believe it was actually directed by Johar and written by Shibani Bathija, who finally proves considerable talent as a writer. The film is thoroughly entertaining and the evident attention Johar paid to the smallest of details is commendable. The film does get sentimental at places, but it never goes over-the-top like Johar's other films and remains fairly restrained and completely authentic, which makes the emotional impact on the viewer much stronger.The film is traditionally a love story more than anything else, but the ever relevant message behind it is wonderfully conveyed through such terms as innocence and guilt, kindness and inhumanity, truth and untruth, justice and injustice, love and hate. All these contrasting terms intelligently swap places through the story of innocent civilians accused for no fault of their own post the 9/11 attacks. The result of this tragic incident made the lives of so many of them miserable. This part of the film is unpleasant viewing even though it is one-sided and not entirely credible.That's where our hero, Rizwan Khan, is thrown. He has Asperger's Syndrome, he's different, he's naive, he takes every word literally, but he is intelligent and talented, and his perception of life is as his beloved mother taught him: the world includes only two groups of people - good people who do good and bad people who do bad. This is so overly general yet so very true. The memory of his mother follows him always, and it's easy to see why. The portrayal of Rizwan's childhood is wonderful. His relationship with the love of his life, Mandira, a young and vibrant single mother who works as a hairdresser and who ultimately agrees to marry him, is totally charming.The narrative style is exemplary. The serious proceedings are flavoured with humour, romance and some wonderful songs. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy create another magical soundtrack and give life to the film with such tracks as ""Sajda"", ""Noor-E-Khuda"" and ""Tera Naina Re"". The fact that songs are playing only over montage sequences letting the actors no chance to lip-sync in a true Hindi film style, is appreciable but I, for one, at points really missed the glamorous and colourful numbers from mainstream films, the more so as it stars Shahrukh Khan and Kajol after so many years.The film clearly works better in the first half. It is much simpler, lighter and more enjoyable. The later half introduces the post-9/11 America with all of its disturbing images of discrimination, mindless attacks and murder. Johar's depiction of this phase is quite flawed though as a film it works. From one side we have Rizwan who goes to tell the world of his complete innocence and his not being a terrorist, and from the other we see his wife Mandira who seeks justice post a very tragic incident of which she blames Khan himself. Sadly most American characters are portrayed as stereotypes, especially the teenagers, although it's forgivable within the context of the film.Khan's journey in the US is enjoyable. It unfolds in several episodes, each one presenting the different people he meets on his way, all quite caricaturish: a motel owner named Jitesh, a lovely Muslim couple who offer him some food, a group of Islamists led by Faisal Rahman whom Khan reports to FBI in order to destroy their violent plans. The most memorable episode, however, is that of Mama Jenny and her son 'Funny Hair' Joel from the rural Wilhemina, Georgia, which is incredibly heart-touching despite being stereotypical to the core. The story of Mamma Jenny is moving, and Johar captures the spirit of the village and its people with skill. The gospel choir in the church singing ""We Shall Overcome"" is one of my favourite scenes in the film.Well, there comes the acting. Shahrukh Khan's appearance in this film in this kind of a role has been the subject of much attention, and rightfully so. This is clearly one of his most challenging roles. He is really good. It's amazing to see him transform from the biggest star in the world into a simple autistic man and play it with conviction. His mannerisms, body language, tone, dialogue delivery and his occasional breaks into timid and embarrassed laughs are all spot on and make his character extremely likable and endearing. This is not his best performance, but it's interesting and more than anything, he still manages to be a star, which is a good thing.As expected, he is totally matched if not surpassed by Kajol, whose charismatic nature, easy charm, evident experience and strong screen presence all rally here into one heartbreaking performance that is replete with authenticity, maturity and strength. As Mandira, she looks incredibly beautiful and is as natural, intense and compelling as ever, playing the part with passion and depth and infusing it with energy and warmth. In some moments she outdoes herself. No, I'm not only referring to her powerful breakdown scenes (which are great), but also the many scenes showing her interaction with Khan. Note for instance the one in which she promptly decides to accept his earnest proposal. It's one of their best moments together.Johar selected a great supporting cast. Every actor, no matter how lengthy his character is, performs well. Zarina Wahab is outstanding in a brief but memorable role as Rizwan's caring and loving mother. Jimmy Shergill is very effective as Rizwan's brother Zakeer, who has always felt deprived by his mother because of his brother's mental disorder. Sonya Jehan is superb as Zakeer's wife Haseena and acts with grace. So is Katie A. Keane who plays Mandira's friend, Sarah. Tanay Chheda is first-rate as the young Rizwan. Jennifer Echols is lovable as Mamma Jenny.To sum it up, My Name is Khan is a nice film and an altogether worthy effort even if not a particularly good film in and of itself. It is interesting for the most part, quite entertaining throughout, and it may definitely make some look at certain things differently. It is well performed and is beautifully shot. Kudos to all involved in the technical area. But above all, it works because of Mr. and Mrs. Khan, who steal the show and take over the film itself and the faulty script. Watch it for them, I recommend you to see their story.",mr mrs khan,my name is khan is without doubt karan johars most accomplished work date powerful moving involving johar not particularly good

9,How Foreigners See Us,"My Name Is Khan is yet another film that will put the Indian film industry on the map. And this is a new phenomenon that America will have to get used to, foreign film countries shooting in the USA and examining our society. For better or worse this is how we seem to many foreigners.Shakrukh Khan creates a character in Rizwan Khan that many Americans will recognize if they've seen Being There, Rainman, and Forrest Gump. Bits from all those films will be found in My Name Is Khan. Khan is a Moslem citizen of India who emigrates to the USA and finds love and happiness when he weds a mother with a son from a previous marriage the wife played by Kajol and the stepson by Yurgon Makaar. She's Hindu, but the different faiths don't seem to matter. Khan suffers from Asperger's syndrome and its challenge enough for him to make his way in the world without picking up on the subtle nuances of the differences of religions and why one group has to hate all the others.All this changes on September 11, 2001 when some fanatical Moslems hijack some airlines and change the course of history forever crashing them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and killing a lot of innocent people, including a few hundred Moslems by all counts of the victims. As in the past here and other places bad behavior by some inflicted a stigma on the group.Young Mr. Makaar is killed in a hate crime incident which changes Khan's relationship with his mother and Khan himself through a combination of circumstances gets on a terrorist watch list. Khan conceives a mission to tell the President of the United States be it George W. Bush or Barack Obama that he is not a terrorist. Both in my professional and family heritage I've got some history with these kind of events. In my former job with Crime Victims Board I had a claim involving a bias attack against a young Arab American boy the same age as Mr. Makaar. It was only when I questioned the young man and his parents I learned of the bias nature of the events. Together with the GLBT liaison with the Kings County District Attorney we went to the Bias Unit of the NYPD and got the case reclassified as a bias attack. Sad though that no one was ever arrested for the crime, but it wasn't for lack of trying here. This was during the years immediately following the first Iraqi War and there was an upswing of attacks on Moslem Americans then as well.After World War I, we had the Palmer Raids in which the Bill of Rights was torn up and under the Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer many suspected radicals of Jewish or Slavic origins were deported in wholesale lots. I had a grand uncle on my mother's side who had such radical politics and he missed being deported by a hair. This was after the Russian Revolution and a number of anarchist bombings including the Morgan Bank on Wall Street and a mail bomb sent to the Attorney General himself. Duly elected Socialist members of the New York State Legislature were expelled at this time. It was not a good era.In the tradition of Peter Sellers, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks, Shahrukh Khan might have an Oscar or nomination at least in his future. Two Magic Kingdom regulars from their teen shows have parts in this, Shane Harper of Good Luck Charlie plays one of the bashers and and Kenton Duty of Shake It Up playing the best friend who turns on Yurgon Makaar show far more acting chops in this than on the Disney Channel.There is no excuse or reason, no justification at all to make war on children. If you want to fight terrorists there's a war now in Afghanistan and probably future wars for the USA unless both we get it right and certain Moslems realize they are not taking the world over for Allah. Ditto the Christians who want to win the world for Jesus. We all have to live together and secular humanism may yet save us all.And this review is dedicated to the late Liz Garro of the Kings County District Attorney's office, the late John Lucyshyn my grand uncle who lived in the USA until his 90s, and to Ziad Abdel-Dayem of Brooklyn who last I heard is a married man. All three of you made the world a better place.",how foreigners see us,my name is khan is yet another film that will put indian film industry map this is new phenomenon that america will have get used foreign film countries shooting usa examining our society better or worse this is how we seem many foreigners shakrukh khan creates character rizwan khan that many americans will recognize if theyve seen being there rainman forrest gump bits all those films will be found my name is khan khan is moslem citizen india who emigrates usa finds love happiness when he weds mother with son previous marriage wife played by kajol stepson by yurgon makaar shes hindu but different faiths dont seem matter khan suffers aspergers syndrome its challenge enough him make his way world without picking up subtle nuances differences religions why one group has hate all others all this changes september 11 2001 when some fanatical moslems hijack some airlines change course history forever crashing them into twin towers world trade center pentagon killing lot innocent people including few hundred moslems by all counts victims as past here other places bad behavior by some inflicted stigma group young mr makaar is killed hate crime incident which changes khans relationship with his mother khan himself through combination circumstances gets terrorist watch list khan conceives mission tell president united states be it george w bush or barack obama that he is not terrorist both my professional family heritage ive got some history with these kind events my former job with crime victims board i had claim involving bias attack against young arab american boy same age as mr makaar it was only when i questioned young man his parents i learned bias nature events together with glbt liaison with kings county district attorney we went bias unit nypd got case reclassified as bias attack sad though that no one was ever arrested crime but it wasnt lack trying here this was during years immediately following first iraqi war there was upswing attacks moslem americans then as well after world war i we had palmer raids which bill rights was torn up under attorney general mitchell palmer many suspected radicals jewish or slavic origins were deported wholesale lots i had grand uncle my mothers side who had such radical politics he missed being deported by hair this was after russian revolution number anarchist bombings including morgan bank wall street mail bomb sent attorney general himself duly elected socialist members new york state legislature were expelled at this time it was not good era tradition peter sellers dustin hoffman tom hanks shahrukh khan might have oscar or nomination at least his future two magic kingdom regulars their teen shows have parts this shane harper good luck charlie plays one bashers kenton duty shake it up playing best friend who turns yurgon makaar show far more acting chops this than disney channel there is no excuse or reason no justification at all make war children if you want fight terrorists theres war now afghanistan probably future wars usa unless both we get it right certain moslems realize they are not taking world over allah ditto christians who want win world jesus we all have live together secular humanism may yet save us all this review is dedicated late liz garro kings county district attorneys office late john lucyshyn my grand uncle who lived usa until his 90s ziad abdel dayem brooklyn who last i heard is married man all three you made world better place,0.43554011093073597,0.07475142045454547,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,'There are two kinds of people: good and bad - and that is all the difference.',"MY NAME IS KHAN is a rather long journey of a film - almost as long the journey depicted in the movie. At three hours in length it may lose some viewers, but for those who stay until the end, the message is larger than life and very important. Especially now, as the world grapples with multiple wars based on differences of beliefs under the flag of 'religion'. As written by Shibani Bathija and Nirajan Iyengar this is a tale of growing to understand and embrace tolerance on many levels. The main character, Khan, in many ways represents Everyman - a human being, imperfect in the eyes of the world because he has Asperger's Syndrome, who discovers the meaning of love and the importance of tolerance so necessary if this world is to stay intact. We first meet Rizwan Khan, an outsider because of his variations from normal due to his Asperger's Syndrome, living with his Muslim mother Razia (Zarina Wahab) and younger brother Zakir: Zakir is gifted and at age 18 leaves Mumbai to move to San Francisco for a new beginning. When Razia dies she makes Khan promise her that he will make a good life - that there are no differences in people except good and bad. Khan (Shahrukh Khan) moves to San Francisco, coping with his disabilities as best he can, finds work with in a cosmetic firm selling lotions and potions for his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill). One of the reasons Khan is successful as a salesman is his utter honesty, and this trait finds an admirer in cosmetologist Mendira (Kajol) who eventually, through a courtship that is as special as any ever filmed, agrees to marry Khan. Zakir condemns the marriage (Mendira is Hindu, Khan Muslim) and will not accept the couple in his and his wife Hasina's (Sonya Jehan) home. Mendira has a young son from a former marriage and that son finds friendship that eventually betrays him: the world of the Bay Area is sick with the aftermath of 9/11 and all Muslims are suspect and disrespected. When Mendira's son is brutally beaten to death, the Hindu Mendira blames herself for marrying a Muslim Khan, and tells his to leave, that the only way she will ever see him again is after he has met with the President of the US to say 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.' Mendira stays in her home struggling with the fact that her son's murderers cannot be found. Khan sets out to travel across the country, attempting to meet the President and deliver his message so that Mendira will take him back. His journey is an examination of human kindness - he is supported by an African American Georgia family Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) when he helps her son, and in turn when a hurricane destroys Mama Jenny's home, Khan returns to help her rebuild, an act that is televised and encourages many Muslims (including Zakir and Hasina) to offer help in the catastrophe. There are many other sidebar stories that occur during Khan's mission to greet the President, each an example of how important communication and equality is life we are to dwell on one planet. Yes, the ending is somewhat saccharine, but the eyes won't likely remain dry as the credits roll. Sharukh Khan is extraordinary as Khan and the supporting cast is very strong, especially the beautiful and talented Kajol. Though there are flaws present, the overriding effect of the story diminishes them to the point of being inconsequential. This is a very beautiful film, one that do well being viewed by every one on the earth!

9,Bollywood's version of America Post 9/11,"As a middle school teacher, I think there aren't many better movies for showing how 9/11 effected our migrant community. The movie is a bit broad, and it is definitely not flag waving, but it tackles real issues, and is emotionally taxing. The lead actor is very, very popular in South Asia, Africa, and China. Many of my students whose parents are from other countries easily recognize the actor. My students are at a point where they are very concerned with others opinions, and are not sure of their place in the world. This film allows my students to empathize with other cultures. It makes my students whose parents are foreign feel less alone. If you are looking for a great American drama, this is not it.

9,Certainly NOT your typical Bollywood picture!,"""My Name is Khan"" is a film you simply must watch with a box of Kleenex nearby. You will shed quite a few tears and it's an emotional roller-coaster watching it. But, it is worth it.The film is about a man named Rizvan Khan, a Muslim Indian man who would be diagnosed has having an Autism Spectrum Disorder. While he's much more functional than many Autistic folks, saying he has Asperger's Syndrome isn't quite right either. Like someone with Asperger's, he is highly intelligent and very functional in many ways...but lacks the ability to understand social graces and nuances. But he also acts a bit odd...avoiding eye contact and behaving, in some ways, like someone classically Autistic. The fact is that there is no one way folks with the disorder act or think...and it is an excellent portrait due to good writing as well as acting by Shahrukh Khan.After Rizvan leaves India for America, the film focuses much on his life and love life...which is very sweet and much like a traditional Bollywood romance...though set in the States. But this is only the first portion. The final half is like a completely different film...a bit like ""Forest Gump"" in that Rizvan goes on a trek across America...meeting some amazing and famous folks along the way. Why does he go off on this journey? See the film.It's pretty obvious that this film was a personal project of love by Shahrukh Khan. He is a Muslim married to a Hindu..just like the characters in the film. And, like the characters in the film, there were a lot of haters who inexplicably attacked Khan for marrying 'an infidel'. This movie is a plea to everyone to stop this hate...and emphasizes the universal goodness (as well as wickedness). The film shows hate in India as well as America...as well as goodness. And, the film shows Muslims being oppressed...and behaving awfully...much like so many others in the film. All in all, it's a modern morality tale...one intended to both entertain and educate the audience.While I loved the film, as did my wife, it is not perfect. A few of the characters (particularly the wife in the story) are inconsistent and some of their actions are confusing and make little sense...and a few seem a bit like caricatures. But even then, there is so much compelling material and the overall story so good, I can easily overlook the flaws.",certainly not your typical bollywood picture,my name is khan is film you simply must watch with box kleenex nearby you will shed quite few tears its emotional roller coaster watching it but it is worth it film is about man named rizvan khan muslim indian man who would be diagnosed has having autism spectrum disorder while hes much more functional than many autistic folks saying he has aspergers syndrome isnt quite right either like someone with aspergers he is highly intelligent very functional many ways but lacks ability understand social graces nuances but he also acts bit odd avoiding eye contact behaving some ways like someone classically autistic fact is that there is no one way folks with disorder act or think it is excellent portrait due good writing as well as acting by shahrukh khan after rizvan leaves india america film focuses much his life love life which is very sweet much like traditional bollywood romance though set states but this is only first portion final half is like completely different film bit like forest gump that rizvan goes trek across america meeting some amazing famous folks along way why does he go off this journey see film its pretty obvious that this film was personal project love by shahrukh khan he is muslim married hindu just like characters film like characters film there were lot haters who inexplicably attacked khan marrying infidel this movie is plea everyone stop this hate emphasizes universal goodness as well as wickedness film shows hate india as well as america as well as goodness film shows muslims being oppressed behaving awfully much like so many others film all all its modern morality tale one intended both entertain educate audience while i loved film as did my wife it is not perfect few characters particularly wife story are inconsistent some their actions are confusing make little sense few seem bit like caricatures but even then there is so much compelling material overall story so good i can easily overlook flaws,0.4985021645021645,0.12371645021645025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.39}"

And who was the funeral for which the two boys, Samier and white boy. Did something happen to the other boys Father which triggered the conversation and unease between the two Mothers? Mystified why Shahrukh Khan, who was the main character of the movie, is not shown in the film credits by IMDb? others have made comment about this.A really wonderful film which should not be missed.

9,Karan Johar's return to directing is an absolute winner,"Ever since I saw Kuch Kuch hota hai in the cinema 12 years ago I have had a fondness for Karan Johar movies, I am also a huge huge of Shah Rukh Khan and therefore I have seen every Johar-Khan collaboration. Their last collaboration Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna left me slightly unsure about whether Johar had lost his touch(even though I didn't think it was as bad as people had told me). My Name is Khan has been all over the news in the past weeks over Shah Rukh's comments about his comments about the Indian cricket team and it incited riots. I won't pass comments about who's right and who's wrong but all I can say is I hope his comments don't make people wary of seeing it because it is a truly entertaining movie. see it with my mother and two sisters and was completely in awe of it till the very end. I had doubts about this movie because from the ads it felt like a movie about terrorism which has been covered many times in the past couple of years in Bollywood(New York,Kurbaan,Fanaa etc)but I was surprised at how different it was from other Bollywood terrorism movies. Instead of dealing with the lives of the terrorists it dealt with the impact terrorism has on the normal citizens. In my life I have only cried watching three movies and My Name is Khan is one of them. It is truly a heartwarming movie and has reestablished my faith in the goodness of strangers. In a way it didn't feel like a Karan Johar movie. It didn't have lavish sound and dance numbers for one. It didn't even have any special appearances by actors(Salman Khan in KKHH, Rani Mukherjee in Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham etc). Although Jimmy Shergill also starred in it but he had a rather lengthy role. In short My Name is Khan surpassed my huge expectations and is a wonderful treat for Bollywood fans.",karan johars return directing is absolute winner,ever since i saw kuch kuch hota hai cinema 12 years ago i have had fondness karan johar movies i am also huge huge shah rukh khan therefore i have seen every johar khan collaboration their last collaboration kabhi alvida na kehna left me slightly unsure about whether johar had lost his touch even though i didnt think it was as bad as people had told me my name is khan has been all over news past weeks over shah rukhs comments about his comments about indian cricket team it incited riots i wont pass comments about whos right whos wrong but all i can say is i hope his comments dont make people wary seeing it because it is truly entertaining movie see it with my mother two sisters was completely awe it till very end i had doubts about this movie because ads it felt like movie about terrorism which has been covered many times past couple years bollywood new york kurbaan fanaa etc but i was surprised at how different it was other bollywood terrorism movies instead dealing with lives terrorists it dealt with impact terrorism has normal citizens my life i have only cried watching three movies my name is khan is one them it is truly heartwarming movie has reestablished my faith goodness strangers way it didnt feel like karan johar movie it didnt have lavish sound dance numbers one it didnt even have any special appearances by actors salman khan kkhh rani mukherjee kabhi khushi kabhi gham etc although jimmy shergill also starred it but he had rather lengthy role short my name is khan surpassed my huge expectations is wonderful treat bollywood fans,0.5661736411736412,0.09768718935385605,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9,A Nutshell Review: My Name is Khan,"Early in the film the tone is set, where Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) is taught by his mom that there are only two groups of people in the world – those who do good and those who do bad. It may be an oversimplification, but if you think about it, that's is exactly what it boils down to, regardless of language, religion and the colour of one's skin.And it is this message that Rizwan, who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, brings along in his extraordinary journey in the United States, and to the people he meets along the way. Schooled by the love of his mother, Rizwan finds himself migrating to the USA thanks to his brother's early entry into the country, and Rizwan's job as a salesman brings him to the love of his life, Mandira (Kajol). In some ways the film provided a tinge of reminiscence to Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump, where a simple man with a disability and living on values of love that his mom had imparted, embarks on the journey called life, encountering love, helping people, and inspiring everyone to become a better person.Karran Johar wrote and produced Kurbaan last year, starring Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor in yet another film which touches on terrorism on US soil, and how intolerance and violence aren't proper solutions to air one's grievances. That film didn't do too well at the box office, probably because it's somewhat of an actioner and a love story rolled into one, and perhaps everyone got distracted by the real life couple in Khan and Kapoor starring opposite each other. In MNIK, Johar takes up directorial duties, and in a stroke of casting genius, put the evergreen SRK with Kajol, who together in their 5 films long before had resulted in nothing other than box office success. My bet is this will likely continue for MNIK.And bringing people by the masses to the cinemas would mean that it's ample opportunity to re-emphasize the strong message of peace, love and tolerance. Yes it has a strong religious flavour to it, especially when it goes on the quiet offensive to take back a religion of peace, and to straighten out the negative effect of misconceptions and prejudices no thanks to extremists hell bent on furthering their selfish gains. Rizwan may not have a quip like Gump's chocolates, but here he stresses from the onset, that his name is Khan, and he's not a terrorist, with childlike earnestness and honesty, in a film of almost an equal stature in its epicness.As with most Bollywood films told in two halves separated by an intermission, the first part comes off much stronger than the second, where we learn of Rizwan and his medical ordeal, where in India his mother struggles to bring up a child who's different. We learn more about Asperger's syndrome as the film wore on, and get enlightened on elements such as the hatred and fear of the colour yellow, an inability to lie and to tell it like it's like without sugar coating, a demeanour unable to express feelings easily, and in the mastery of a skill, in which case here it's being a technical expert. The romantic angle also gets drummed up as we see how Rizwan courts Mandira in his own way, with the narrative told in flashbacks (with nicely done transitions) as we move forward in time with Rizwan's quest to meet the President of the USA, which we will find out why.The later half focused very strongly in that quest, as we see how others touch and lend their support to Rizwan, as much as he reciprocates. Ample time also gets dedicated to the post- 9/11 America with its growing suspicions and mindless attacks on those on the wrong end of racial profiling. The story in this part goes two-pronged, with Rizwan's quest as well as Mandira's thirst for justice to be done. More time gets spent away from each other, and Rizwan's journey proved all the more interesting, with episodes such as that with Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) and Funny Hair Joel (Adrian Kali Turner) which will tug at your heartstrings, bringing back to mind that Bollywood hardly lets up on moments to turn on the melodrama if it can. Between the two halves, it's likely to feel that the initial half is the better of the two, though with minor plot loopholes aside, the second did suffer from a last minute gasp of a sub-plot involving religious radicals, but wrapped everything up rather nicely in a full circle fashion.SRK disappears into the role and becomes heart and soul of the film as Rizwan, no longer the mega-star boasting an awesome physique, but a simple man who lives life as best as he can given his condition, seeking to help others and to become that symbolic beacon of light against bigots. SRK gives a superbly sensitive performance and it's likely the unfortunate, uncontrollable antics of Rizwan would endear the character to you, eliciting support as you root for him to complete his mission despite the challenges laid out for him to overcome. In his last two major films, he had introduced the likes of rookies Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma to the world, but I guess one probably needs a seasoned veteran in Kajol to hold her own opposite the Khan when he delves into what could probably be his best role to date.And that character's name is Khan, and he is not a terrorist. High recommended!",nutshell review my name is khan,early film tone is set where rizwan khan shah rukh khan is taught by his mom that there are only two groups people world those who do good those who do bad it may be oversimplification but if you think about it thats is exactly what it boils down regardless language religion colour ones skin it is this message that rizwan who suffers aspergers syndrome brings along his extraordinary journey united states people he meets along way schooled by love his mother rizwan finds himself migrating usa thanks his brothers early entry into country rizwans job as salesman brings him love his life mandira kajol some ways film provided tinge reminiscence robert zemeckis forrest gump where simple man with disability living values love that his mom had imparted embarks journey called life encountering love helping people inspiring everyone become better person karran johar wrote produced kurbaan last year starring saif ali khan kareena kapoor yet another film which touches terrorism us soil how intolerance violence arent proper solutions air ones grievances that film didnt do too well at box office probably because its somewhat actioner love story rolled into one perhaps everyone got distracted by real life couple khan kapoor starring opposite each other mnik johar takes up directorial duties stroke casting genius put evergreen srk with kajol who together their 5 films long before had resulted nothing other than box office success my bet is this will likely continue mnik bringing people by masses cinemas would mean that its ample opportunity re emphasize strong message peace love tolerance yes it has strong religious flavour it especially when it goes quiet offensive take back religion peace straighten out negative effect misconceptions prejudices no thanks extremists hell bent furthering their selfish gains rizwan may not have quip like gumps chocolates but here he stresses onset that his name is khan hes not terrorist with childlike earnestness honesty film almost equal stature its epicness as with most bollywood films told two halves separated by intermission first part comes off much stronger than second where we learn rizwan his medical ordeal where india his mother struggles bring up child whos different we learn more about aspergers syndrome as film wore get enlightened elements such as hatred fear colour yellow inability lie tell it like its like without sugar coating demeanour unable express feelings easily mastery skill which case here its being technical expert romantic angle also gets drummed up as we see how rizwan courts mandira his own way with narrative told flashbacks with nicely done transitions as we move forward time with rizwans quest meet president usa which we will find out why later half focused very strongly that quest as we see how others touch lend their support rizwan as much as he reciprocates ample time also gets dedicated post 9 11 america with its growing suspicions mindless attacks those wrong end racial profiling story this part goes two pronged with rizwans quest as well as mandiras thirst justice be done more time gets spent away each other rizwans journey proved all more interesting with episodes such as that with mama jenny jennifer echols funny hair joel adrian kali turner which will tug at your heartstrings bringing back mind that bollywood hardly lets up moments turn melodrama if it can between two halves its likely feel that initial half is better two though with minor plot loopholes aside second did suffer last minute gasp sub plot involving religious radicals but wrapped everything up rather nicely full circle fashion srk disappears into role becomes heart soul film as rizwan no longer mega star boasting awesome physique but simple man who lives life as best as he can given his condition seeking help others become that symbolic beacon light against bigots srk gives superbly sensitive performance its likely unfortunate uncontrollable antics rizwan would endear character you eliciting support as you root him complete his mission despite challenges laid out him overcome his last two major films he had introduced likes rookies deepika padukone anushka sharma world but i guess one probably needs seasoned veteran kajol hold her own opposite khan when he delves into what could probably be his best role date that characters name is khan he is not terrorist high recommended,0.4622878028404343,0.12948538011695906,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10,His Name is Khan & he is a LEGEND !!!,"Rizwan Khan : I want to see the President of the United States Security Incharge : Why ? Is he a friend of yours ? Rizwan : No No. He is not a friend of mine. I have something to say to him.That is Karan Johar's My Name is Khan, his most flawless & perfect film till date. The MNIK trailer which released in the 2009 year end attracted the attention of most of the public as well as the critics. "" Oh ! Damn ! another film based on 9/11 tragedy after Kurbaan. "" was one such comment displaying negation about the film since Kurbaan starring Saif Ali Khan & Kareena Kapoor proved to be a box-office debacle. Although people mistook MNIK to be a film on terrorism judging from the famous one liner from the movie where Shah Rukh says "" My Name is Khan And I am Not a terrorist "", it wasn't one.It must have required a sheer amount of hard work & dedication. Bearing a strong resemblance to Russell Crowe's role as schizophrenic in Ron Howard's ' A Beautiful Mind ', Shah Rukh Khan managed to pull it off quite well & enacted the role of an Asperger's Syndrome victim with subtlety. Sources say that he used to live as the character of the film even at his own residence only to perfect himself more & more.As far as the sensitive & riveting storyline, outstanding direction & lead actor's extraordinary brilliance put into the film was concerned, the films had all its points up as the contender for a National Award. As far as the story of the film is taken into view, if you listen to it verbally it sounds too naive since story of an autistic who goes on a journey to win back his love sounds a little boring but a Karan Johar- SRK film can never be so underrated & simple. It has to be powerful & poignant.Overall, on the celluloid , the movie is a love story; a genre where Johar has expressed his mastery before in collaboration with Shah Rukh in films like Kuch Kuch Hota Hain, Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham & Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. However main focus of his previously directed ventures was on human relationships; may it be a father-son relationship or may it be showing an extra-martial affair .However, MNIK was bigger & dealt with some real-life issues, adding a religious flavor to it. The plot line is engaging as it progresses. Rizwan Khan suffering from Asperger's Syndrome stays with his mother & brother in Mumbai. "" There are only two types of people in this world. The good & the evil. There exists no other difference "" Zarina Wahab who plays Rizwan's ammi gives him the most important lesson of his life thus setting up the tone of the film. This message is the only platform where the whole movie stands firmly on as you see numerous occasions where Rizwan applies various other values, which his ammi has successfully inculcated in him.But soon after her death, Rizwan migrates to San Fransisco, USA to stay with his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill ). But soon a void is created in the relationship between the brothers as Rizwan decides to marry a Hindu girl, Mandira (Kajol). The film shows some of the really enchanting scenes as Rizwan desperately tries all possible ways to win the heart of his lady love & finally succeeding in his attempts. Gradually after few years of marriage, 9/11 tragedy creeps in & all thanks to the evil prejudices of the extremists, every Muslim in US gets frowned upon as a downright terrorist by the inhabitants and in such atmosphere even an autistic Muslim was not an exception.Further, Rizwan's step son & his only best friend Sameer gets beaten up by the college bullies & dies eventually due to internal bleeding. The cause of his intentional beating up was the fact that he was a son of a Muslim and this enrages Mandira who thinks it was her fault that she married a Muslim & out of fury, she tells Rizwan to leave the house who out of pain & agony, embarks upon a long journey to win back his love. His repeated failed attempts to tell the President of the United States that "" His name is Khan & he is not a terrorist "" showcases Khan's wish to broadcast it globally that even if he is a Muslim, it doesn't imply in any sense that he is a terror causing entity.MNIK is a story of this man's journey who inspires humanity in every way possible. A clear display of tolerance, perseverance, religion & the strong power of love is dis played in MNIK. It captivates you for the entire duration & keeps you totally mesmerized with some strong performances by the lead cast.The most emotional & lump-in-the-throat causing scene was the one where after being revived of the charges of being a terrorist, Rizwan goes to rescue one of the best acquaintances he had; Mama Jenny & her son Funny Hair Joel from floods in Wilhelmina, Georgia. The media covers the scenes of his rescue attempts & broadcasts it on TV claiming that very person who was suspected to be a terrorist is rescuing the flood- stricken victims in Georgia. Rizwan not only does good but also inspires it in every way possible.An artistic direction, excellent cinematography, an engaging & a new concept & award-winning performances by the lead pair itself make MNIK a worthy endeavor to bag the National Award for the best film.",his name is khan he is legend,rizwan khan i want see president united states security incharge why is he friend yours rizwan no no he is not friend mine i have something say him that is karan johars my name is khan his most flawless perfect film till date mnik trailer which released 2009 year end attracted attention most public as well as critics oh damn another film based 9 11 tragedy after kurbaan was one such comment displaying negation about film since kurbaan starring saif ali khan kareena kapoor proved be box office debacle although people mistook mnik be film terrorism judging famous one liner movie where shah rukh says my name is khan i am not terrorist it wasnt one it must have required sheer amount hard work dedication bearing strong resemblance russell crowes role as schizophrenic ron howards beautiful mind shah rukh khan managed pull it off quite well enacted role aspergers syndrome victim with subtlety sources say that he used live as character film even at his own residence only perfect himself more more as far as sensitive riveting storyline outstanding direction lead actors extraordinary brilliance put into film was concerned films had all its points up as contender national award as far as story film is taken into view if you listen it verbally it sounds too naive since story autistic who goes journey win back his love sounds little boring but karan johar srk film can never be so underrated simple it has be powerful poignant overall celluloid movie is love story genre where johar has expressed his mastery before collaboration with shah rukh films like kuch kuch hota hain kabhi khushi kabhi gham kabhi alvida na kehna however main focus his previously directed ventures was human relationships may it be father son relationship or may it be showing extra martial affair however mnik was bigger dealt with some real life issues adding religious flavor it plot line is engaging as it progresses rizwan khan suffering aspergers syndrome stays with his mother brother mumbai there are only two types people this world good evil there exists no other difference zarina wahab who plays rizwans ammi gives him most important lesson his life thus setting up tone film this message is only platform where whole movie stands firmly as you see numerous occasions where rizwan applies various other values which his ammi has successfully inculcated him but soon after her death rizwan migrates san fransisco usa stay with his brother zakir jimmy shergill but soon void is created relationship between brothers as rizwan decides marry hindu girl mandira kajol film shows some really enchanting scenes as rizwan desperately tries all possible ways win heart his lady love finally succeeding his attempts gradually after few years marriage 9 11 tragedy creeps all thanks evil prejudices extremists every muslim us gets frowned upon as downright terrorist by inhabitants such atmosphere even autistic muslim was not exception further rizwans step son his only best friend sameer gets beaten up by college bullies dies eventually due internal bleeding cause his intentional beating up was fact that he was son muslim this enrages mandira who thinks it was her fault that she married muslim out fury she tells rizwan leave house who out pain agony embarks upon long journey win back his love his repeated failed attempts tell president united states that his name is khan he is not terrorist showcases khans wish broadcast it globally that even if he is muslim it doesnt imply any sense that he is terror causing entity mnik is story this mans journey who inspires humanity every way possible clear display tolerance perseverance religion strong power love is dis played mnik it captivates you entire duration keeps you totally mesmerized with some strong performances by lead cast most emotional lump throat causing scene was one where after being revived charges being terrorist rizwan goes rescue one best acquaintances he had mama jenny her son funny hair joel floods wilhelmina georgia media covers scenes his rescue attempts broadcasts it tv claiming that very person who was suspected be terrorist is rescuing flood stricken victims georgia rizwan not only does good but also inspires it every way possible artistic direction excellent cinematography engaging new concept award winning performances by lead pair itself make mnik worthy endeavor bag national award best film,0.5847413104694658,0.20369961753456894,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10,"Powerful, Heartbreaking and Elevating....","I stepped into the theater to watch 'My name is Khan' 1 month after I had watched Avatar,so I was mentally prepared to be let down as the bar raised by AVATAR was sky high.Also I felt that this movie would be a typical KARAN JOHAR flick with love story intermingled between family ties,also in bollywood,most over-hyped movie really disappoint,but 15 minutes into the movie,I just got absorbed in it,such that the magic continued till the end.The movie is basically comprised of adventures and misadventures of an Autistic named Rizwan Khan but beware,it is not one of those movies which cash on the sympathy of suffering from a anomaly,it does have a hero who has a heart of gold,but the movie carries a marathon message,it raises questions,like WHY ARE MUSLIMS SUFFERING POST 9/11? ARE ALL MUSLIMS TERRORISTS? WHAT EXACTLY DOES Islam TEACH AND MEAN? Being a Muslim myself and having suffered same extra security checks at airports just because of my religion,I really got connected to the movie instantly,the realistic depiction of life after 9/11 is much more effective than KHUDA KE LIYE or NEW YORK..But its not a movie for Muslims only,it asks non-muslims to judge the person and not the religion.Something any other bollywood movie hasn't ever done.Now to the performances,MNIK was tailor made for Shahrukh Khan as Rizwan Khan and it demanded an equally towering performance.Shahrukh has always been criticized for similarity in his acting performances but this role is entirely different.To play an autistic and deliver is not easy,and Shahrukh does it so naturally and perfectly.You get in love with SK in the very first scene in airport,you cry with him,you laugh with him,you fall in love with him and as the movie ends,you feel good for him,its not an easy task at all to accomplish,this is Shahrukh's best performance to date and this really silents people who question his number one slot in bollywood.Kajol has always been a class to see and this time its the same with her.Being a mother of 2,she doesn't look aged at all,though this time Karan Johar doesn't give her much screen time as compared to previous movies,but still when she is on screen,you just feel so fresh.Her role as Mandira who falls in love and marries Rizwan is a delight especially her scenes as mother.SK-Kajol Chemistry has always been a blockbuster (BAAZIGAR,DILWALE DULHANIYA LE JAAEN GE,KARAN ARJUN,KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI,KABHI KHUSHI KABHI GHAM) this is now 6/6 for their roles together and what an achievement that is.The rest of cast does fine especially Navneet Nishan does make you smile whenever she is on screen.The music of the movie is according to the flavor of the movie,cute,melodious and unlike other bollywood movies,doesn't slow down the progression of the movie.Another plus of this movie is the script written perfectly by Shibani Bhatija.The teachings of Islam intercombined with Sk's character,love story,sub plots all blend well,not a single piece of dialogue is weak,not a single scene blunt,but perfectly executed.Since he rose to stardom as director of KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI,there is always a lot of expectation from Karan Johar which rises with each of his movies,this time he changes gear to pure DRAMA,the movie has a Hollywood look to it,the scenes captured are really pleasant,be it Washington DC or Georgia,as you travel with SK,the camera angles the sky views,the scene where SK takes Kajol to top of a hill,the roads of Sans Francisco,its all a journey from A to Z and Karan's direction makes it utterly enjoyable.Well done.A lot of people have complained about the sub plots in 2nd half in the movie but people,this movie is just not a love story,but about the problems of Muslims in USA and also about the life of RIZWAN KHAN,so sub plots were needed to carry the movie forward.Don't listen to people who are criticizing this master piece,its an Indian epic and a very very different movie.Go watch it,feel it,and come out realizing NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS.",powerful heartbreaking elevating,i stepped into theater watch my name is khan 1 month after i had watched avatar so i was mentally prepared be let down as bar raised by avatar was sky high also i felt that this movie would be typical karan johar flick with love story intermingled between family ties also bollywood most over hyped movie really disappoint but 15 minutes into movie i just got absorbed it such that magic continued till end movie is basically comprised adventures misadventures autistic named rizwan khan but beware it is not one those movies which cash sympathy suffering anomaly it does have hero who has heart gold but movie carries marathon message it raises questions like why are muslims suffering post 9 11 are all muslims terrorists what exactly does islam teach mean being muslim myself having suffered same extra security checks at airports just because my religion i really got connected movie instantly realistic depiction life after 9 11 is much more effective than khuda ke liye or new york but its not movie muslims only it asks non muslims judge person not religion something any other bollywood movie hasnt ever done now performances mnik was tailor made shahrukh khan as rizwan khan it demanded equally towering performance shahrukh has always been criticized similarity his acting performances but this role is entirely different play autistic deliver is not easy shahrukh does it so naturally perfectly you get love with sk very first scene airport you cry with him you laugh with him you fall love with him as movie ends you feel good him its not easy task at all accomplish this is shahrukhs best performance date this really silents people who question his number one slot bollywood kajol has always been class see this time its same with her being mother 2 she doesnt look aged at all though this time karan johar doesnt give her much screen time as compared previous movies but still when she is screen you just feel so fresh her role as mandira who falls love marries rizwan is delight especially her scenes as mother sk kajol chemistry has always been blockbuster baazigar dilwale dulhaniya le jaaen ge karan arjun kuch kuch hota hai kabhi khushi kabhi gham this is now 6 6 their roles together what achievement that is rest cast does fine especially navneet nishan does make you smile whenever she is screen music movie is according flavor movie cute melodious unlike other bollywood movies doesnt slow down progression movie another plus this movie is script written perfectly by shibani bhatija teachings islam intercombined with sks character love

10,"Rizwan Khan, the world's worst salesman","Mandira tells Rizwan she'll buy 6 hair products from him but he tells her he'll only sell her four because the remaining two will go to waste. He may be the world's worst salesman but he's the best human being. This is Rizwan, an innocent, clean hearted, simple guy who believes there are only two types of people in this world; those who are good and those who are bad. The reason for his innocence and candidness is due to the Asperger's Syndrome. You see he may be different but he definitely isn't stupid, in fact I believe we can all learn from him.The plot of this film is well known so I won't bore you with too much detail. This film is essentially a love story between Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan) and Mandira (Kajol). However due to the events of the time their relationship is destroyed and Rizwan innocently sets out on a journey to clear his name.When watching the film you'll see Karan has once again used flashbacks to portray his story but this is not your typical Karan Johar film. It is clearly more realistic than his previous films and I must say he has matured well.The first half is focused on the Rizwan-Mandira love story. And it is done in a style that only Karan could do. I am a big fan of his previous ""young"" love stories but he is even better in this mature, realistic portrayal of ""love at first sight"". He makes us feel what Rizwan feels through his direction.My only problems with this film are in the second half when it begins to get more dramatic. And SRK mentioned himself that he wished the film was handled in a different way. And I completely agree with him. Where the first half succeeded in being fluent and tightly knit, the second half begins to become more far-fetched and loose. And I blame this on Shibani Bhatija. In terms of cinematography, you've got to give it to Ravi K Chandran, the film was filmed beautifully. The locales were very pleasing to the eye, were not over-powering and used simply as a back-drop. Coming onto the extras, I think this is possibly the only Bollywood film that has managed to correctly use English speaking actors and not turn them into caricatures or use fake dubbing. And for once, these extras can actually act! They have been used brilliantly and are totally believable.The supporting cast is flawless, they are relatively unknown actors (apart from Jimmy Shergill) and this is effective in making the story believable. They give heart-felt performances that compliment the lead actors.Coming to the lead actors... Rizwan Khan is without a doubt my most favourite character from any film. His sincerity and innocence is heart wrenching and there is only one man who could have done justice to this role and that is Shah Rukh Khan.Is there any role this man cannot do? He's done it all and yet he can still leave us gob-smacked. While watching the film I was in awe. In the scenes where Rizwan is faced with some sort of confrontation or hard- ship, he goes back into his shell and finds comfort in his religion. SRK makes you feel Rizwan's loneliness and confusion of how the world can be the way it is. When Rizwan is happy, you feel happy; when he is sad, you feel sad; when he is hurt, you feel hurt; and when he is confused and lost, you feel like reaching out and protecting him. I could keep going on about Rizwan and SRK but I would not do them justice, you have to go see the film to realise what I mean.I'm so glad to see Kajol back and especially with SRK. Their chemistry in previous films has created history and they do it once again in MNIK. She compliments SRK so well because she is a great actress herself. Look out for the outburst at Rizwan that has been mentioned so many times and her breakdown just before that. THE greatest actress Bollywood has ever had, periodGo watch this film now and I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Shah Rukh Khan alone will make sure of that. I myself am going to go watch it a few more times and I can't wait!",rizwan khan worlds worst salesman,mandira tells rizwan shell buy 6 hair products him but he tells her hell only sell her four because remaining two will go waste he may be worlds worst salesman but hes best human being this is rizwan innocent clean hearted simple guy who believes there are only two types people this world those who are good those who are bad reason his innocence candidness is due aspergers syndrome you see he may be different but he definitely isnt stupid fact i believe we can all learn him plot this film is well known so i wont bore you with too much detail this film is essentially love story between rizwan khan shahrukh khan mandira kajol however due events time their relationship is destroyed rizwan innocently sets out journey clear his name when watching film youll see karan has once again used flashbacks portray his story but this is not your typical karan johar film it is clearly more realistic than his previous films i must say he has matured well first half is focused rizwan mandira love story it is done style that only karan could do i am big fan his previous young love stories but he is even better this mature realistic portrayal love at first sight he makes us feel what rizwan feels through his direction my only problems with this film are second half when it begins get more dramatic srk mentioned himself that he wished film was handled different way i completely agree with him where first half succeeded being fluent tightly knit second half begins become more far fetched loose i blame this shibani bhatija terms cinematography youve got give it ravi k chandran film was filmed beautifully locales were very pleasing eye were not over powering used simply as back drop coming onto extras i think this is possibly only bollywood film that has managed correctly use english speaking actors not turn them into caricatures or use fake dubbing once these extras can actually act they have been used brilliantly are totally believable supporting cast is flawless they are relatively unknown actors apart jimmy shergill this is effective making story believable they give heart felt performances that compliment lead actors coming lead actors rizwan khan is without doubt my most favourite character any film his sincerity innocence is heart wrenching there is only one man who could have done justice this role that is shah rukh khan is there any role this man cannot do hes done it all yet he can still leave us gob smacked while watching film i was awe scenes where rizwan is faced with some sort confrontation or hard ship he goes back into his shell finds comfort his religion srk makes you feel rizwans loneliness confusion how world can be way it is when rizwan is happy you feel happy when he is sad you feel sad when he is hurt you feel hurt when he is confused lost you feel like reaching out protecting him i could keep going about rizwan srk but i would not do them justice you have go see film realise what i mean im so glad see kajol back especially with srk their chemistry previous films has created history they do it once again mnik she compliments srk so well because she is great actress herself look out outburst at rizwan that has been mentioned so many times her breakdown just before that greatest actress bollywood has ever had periodgo watch this film now i promise you you will not be disappointed shah rukh khan alone will make sure that i myself am going go watch it few more times i cant wait,0.5342440545565545,0.11390536546786549,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.3}"

6,"Appreciable effort to bring a change in the society but would find it hard to convince the people who are well familiar with the works of Dustin Hoffman, Sean Penn & Tom Hanks","After watching this prestigious project of King Khan, the most interesting revelation to make is, that in MNIK the two close friends of Khan, Kajol & Karan have scored well ahead of Shahrukh in all respects. In other words, the movie and its emotional experience entirely belongs to Kajol, for her outstanding performance and Karan, for his unexpectedly hard hitting & thoughtful direction.It right away starts off with the already famous scene of Shahrukh's interrogation at the airport and then keeps on moving into a series of flashbacks. The first half has a slow pace and is more or less predictable. Still, the subtle scenes between Shahrukh & Kajol are nicely written and finely executed. However the scene where Shahrukh shows Kajol, the city from a hill top is quite similar to the one in ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"". Besides this, the childhood sequences of Khan's life, lack the required depth and could have been much better.The real action starts post intermission, which also leads to major glitches in the screenplay. The sequences where Shahrukh is travelling through various places, meeting variety of people is a bit lengthy also highly inspired from Tom Hank's ""Forrest Gump"". Actually as the main emphasis shifts onto the theme of meeting the President, the film takes an unexpected turn and goes over the top to some extent. The un-necessary focus on media coverage and political references takes away the emotional essence of the story, making the viewer a little uninterested.To be precise there are three strong merits in MNIK.1. One is the amazingly natural and highly expressive performance by Kajol. In fact I would like to rate Kajol's emotional scene with her son, as one of best ever tragedy scenes in Hindi Films till date. The sequence reminded me of an equally great hospital scene of ""Sharaabi"".2. Second is the director Karan Johar, who surprisingly returns with a more realistic, dark and controversial subject, completely in contrast with all of his previous projects.3. Third and the most important merit of the movie is its solid and hard-hitting message to the world that ""Everyone in a particular religion or community cannot and should not be punished for the inhuman crimes committed by a few people of the same origin."" Coming back to Shahrukh Khan, the hard work is clearly visible and the effort is quite admirable. Shahrukh no doubt comes up with a noticeable performance as The Khan. But truly speaking, there are undeniable glimpses of Dustin Hoffman & Sean Penn, clearly visible in his autistic act. Khan's performance will surely impress millions of his Bollywood fans who love watching only Hindi Films. But for the movie buffs who are well familiar with Dustin Hoffman in ""Rainman"", Sean Penn in ""I am Sam"" and Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump""., Shahrukh has simply done a good job. He visibly tries hard to move away from all the above references and does come up with a fine performance. But the impact of all the above three names in their respective roles is so huge that it unintentionally leads you to a comparison.In addition to this, the writing also shows some major faults in the screenplay. For instance, I am still not able to figure out that which Hindu-Muslim Riots happened in 1983 in Mumbai. Secondly, in the few initial scenes, it's shown that Shahrukh has a serious problem with Yellow color. Yet in the second half he is shown holding a yellow cardboard in his hand.Lastly in the final hour, everything just goes on happening so easily, which completely contradicts the realistic feel of the movie and lessens its final impact on the viewer. The movies also raises a question that why Karan approved of making ""Kurbaan"" on a similar subject of 9/11 impact on Muslims in America, when he was himself making MNIK on the same subject? Apart from the impressive Kajol act, Jimmy Shergil excels in his few scenes and so does Sonya Jehan who plays Jimmy's wife. Parveen Dabbas shines as a Sikh who opts for cutting his hair after 9/11 in order to survive the hate attacks. Both Vinay Pathak and Zareena Wahab make their presence felt in their small roles.Cinematography is great with some new unexplored locations looking fresh on screen. But I found Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music lacking the melody part once again. However, Karan very intelligently, uses only few full length songs in the movie and rest of them are just there as a part of the background music.Summing up, ""MNIK"" is surely one of those few good movies which are capable of raising a question and starting a debate. Many of the viewers might miss the regular glossy & romantic feature of a Shahrukh-Karan film. But MNIK is a clear indication of changing times in Bollywood and should be taken in good spirits.It's not a perfect piece of art but a laudable effort indeed from Dharma Productions.",appreciable effort bring change society but would find it hard convince people who are well familiar with works dustin hoffman sean penn tom hanks,after watching this prestigious project king khan most interesting revelation make is that mnik two close friends khan kajol karan have scored well ahead shahrukh all respects other words movie its emotional experience entirely belongs kajol her outstanding performance karan his unexpectedly hard hitting thoughtful direction it right away starts off with already famous scene shahrukhs interrogation at airport then keeps moving into series flashbacks first half has slow pace is more or less predictable still subtle scenes between shahrukh kajol are nicely written finely executed however scene where shahrukh shows kajol city hill top is quite similar one rab ne bana di jodi besides this childhood sequences khans life lack required depth could have been much better real action starts post intermission which also leads major glitches screenplay sequences where shahrukh is travelling through various places meeting variety people is bit lengthy also highly inspired tom hanks forrest gump actually as main emphasis shifts onto theme meeting president film takes unexpected turn goes over top some extent un necessary focus media coverage political references takes away emotional essence story making viewer little uninterested be precise there are three strong merits mnik 1 one is amazingly natural highly expressive performance by kajol fact i would like rate kajols emotional scene with her son as one best ever tragedy scenes hindi films till date sequence reminded me equally great hospital scene sharaabi 2 second is director karan johar who surprisingly returns with more realistic dark controversial subject completely contrast with all his previous projects 3 third most important merit movie is its solid hard hitting message world that everyone particular religion or community cannot should not be punished inhuman crimes committed by few people same origin coming back shahrukh khan hard work is clearly visible effort is quite admirable shahrukh no doubt comes up with noticeable performance as khan but truly speaking there are undeniable glimpses dustin hoffman sean penn clearly visible his autistic act khans performance will surely impress millions his bollywood fans who love watching only hindi films but movie buffs who are well familiar with dustin hoffman rainman sean penn i am sam tom hanks forrest gump shahrukh has simply done good job he visibly tries hard move away all above references does come up with fine performance but impact all above three names their respective roles is so huge that it unintentionally leads you comparison addition this writing also shows some major faults screenplay instance i am still not able figure out that which hindu muslim riots happened 1983 mumbai secondly few initial scenes its shown that shahrukh has serious problem with yellow color yet second half he is shown holding yellow cardboard his hand lastly final hour everything just goes happening so easily which completely contradicts realistic feel movie lessens its final impact viewer movies also raises question that why karan approved making kurbaan similar subject 9 11 impact muslims america when he was himself making mnik same subject apart impressive kajol act jimmy shergil excels his few scenes so does sonya jehan who plays jimmys wife parveen dabbas shines as sikh who opts cutting his hair after 9 11 order survive hate attacks both vinay pathak zareena wahab make their presence felt their small roles cinematography is great with some new unexplored locations looking fresh screen but i found shankar ehsaan loys music lacking melody part once again however karan very intelligently uses only few full length songs movie rest them are just there as part background music summing up mnik is surely one those few good movies which are capable raising question starting debate many viewers might miss regular glossy romantic feature shahrukh karan film but mnik is clear indication changing times bollywood should be taken good spirits its not perfect piece art but laudable effort indeed dharma productions,0.48234833433985974,0.13364049086506716,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8,a personal view,"The story of Rizvan Khan a Muslim man with Asperger's syndrome who in fact one of the most beautiful human beings I could think of real or fictitious, perfect by design and world view nothing else. His story is one of simple understanding, love and devotion. I believe that the first scene in which we meet Khan, first searching the presidents travel itinerary and then packing his belongings for this unknown trip. There is no indication at first about his disability, then in line to board the flight he is detained for two reasons, one he is acting oddly and speaking in a foreign tongue and because he is also very strikingly in resemblance to a middle eastern Muslim, which he is. This scene is set up by daunting music suggesting something malicious might be about to happen. Once he is detained you are able to see the process in which he is searched, they only find the things he needs for his journey, identification of him as a special needs individual and his itinerary of the presidents travels. Khan is interrogated briefly by men who are obviously making a joke at his expense and they despite their racism are inclined to let him go because they understand his threat is very little as they can witness. I believe this is a demonstration of them being law abiding despite their racism is a foreshadowing to the tone of the movie. Showing Khan as a main character through his interrogation and examination but also telling about his and his special needs but also speaking to his, although limited in some sense, understanding of the world through which he builds his life and pursues his goals. I believe the setting is very important from an area of conflict where Khan learned about good and bad people in the midst of Hindu/Muslim riots in which he learned the basis through which he would judge all people for the rest of his life, with very good examples of what is and what is not. After his move to San Francisco he receives his American education and is also exposed to modern psychology through his sister in-law who finds his diagnosis. This is important because San Francisco which is the place where many criminals were sent historically but also where there was a large rate of acceptance of people who were discriminated against such as gays and many other racial groups who historically and still seek residence there where they might be accepted. I have noticed that a song or sound that has been implemented in the movie to indicate something is called Tere Naina, this song is played all through the process in which Khan and Mandira are getting to know each other through his sales of his brothers product and then after when they become friends and start to see each other outside of the salon where Mandira works. This song is supposed to be indicative of the love which is developed and shared between them throughout the movie. This relationship being an exact illustration of Khan's character, beauty and love no matter which differences are fabricated for them by the world they see nothing that should hold them back from their blossoming romance and relationship. There are several grouping themes in this movie; the most important one is identified in the beginning of the movie is when his mother tells him there is only good and bad, no Hindu and Muslim, no white and colored. There are obvious examples of good Muslim through Khan versus the bad extremists, good white family versus the bad white people who don't understand or support him trying to share in the memorial ceremony as a Muslim. There is also his brother who believes Hindus are a threat to Muslim way of life but he tells his brother there is no good Muslim, bad Hindu only good person and bad person. There is also good and bad FBI representatives good is the minority woman who gives his psych evaluation and bad is the man who tortures and interrogates him. Good women and bad women, good men and bad men. The one thing I did notice is that the majority of the people who help him are minorities or happen to be educated about his condition, such as the women from the center who did his diagnosis in the autism center, the wife of his brother who teaches at a college, the FBI psychiatrist. I believe that there is an overarching idea of American ignorance throughout the movie. This ignorance causes more suffering than the actual attacks on the world trade center not only for the people who are suffering because of direct loss but those who are involved in hate crimes such as the ones perpetrated on Sameer Khan, first when his locker is stuffed with photos of Osama Bin Ladin and then again when he is killed because he is beat to death. There are many other minorities which there are hate crimes filmed from the shop owner to the motel owner to the wife of his brother. All of which are assaulted by people who are scared and hurting and all the while there is propaganda giving false ideas about the Muslim faith from public schools to the news and other public news media sources.

2,Much ado about absolutely nothing,"Rizvan Khan (SRK with a serious hangover of Hoffman from 'Rainman' but with neither the legendary touch nor the convincing seriousness) is a man suffering from Asperger's Syndrome. He has a clearly secular mother (Wahab in a decent role) who has taught him that there are just either good or bad people in the world. Something, as we all know, just isn't true but then considering the already complicated personality of Rizvan, Mr. Johar decides to dumb it down to 'his level'. Tragic.He then arrives in You-Yes-Yeah following his bizarrely irreverent brother (Jimmy Shergill in a role that never quite manages to find ground) to sell cosmetics for his company. So far, interestingly, things chug along evenly. Steady storyboard and all that. Bam! Mandira enters (Kajol in her usual indulgent self as evidenced in her groupie's directorial flicks) and things start getting 'Bollywood-ized'. The cliché rain begins. Rizvan almost instantly breaks into 'Tere Naina Tere Naina' and a few frames later asks her to marry him. She, a divorcée with apparently a seriously troubled past, gives him a mundane task (watch the film for this one) so that she may 'consider' marrying a guy she recently met. Even if I looked past the cinematic liberties here, the fact that she actually agrees to marry him raises serious questions about her character's conviction. A single mother who is just moving to a new place in a country like United States might, umm well, think twice before remarrying and that too with, ahem, a person with a clear form of autism. But not Mandira – no no – she is all for it in a blink. Heck, it is even hinted that they have sex on their first night thanks to 'Intercourse for dummies'. Made me think a lot of Indian men probably need that book too.Now to the nucleus of this tale – 9/11 and its affects on innocent Muslims in the US. Whats that you say? That was almost a decade ago and people might find this theme a tad overused now? Well not according to Mr.J's yarn since we have random rednecks flipping off shopkeepers just because they wear a white cap, we have unnamed yanks smashing windows of desi motel owners and heck, we even have kids at school smashing that 'Paki' kid since his skin is brown. Yaaawn. How many movies have already dealt with this over the last decade? I lose count now.And so Mr. Khan embarks on this supposedly iconic journey (much like the 'run' Hanks did in Gump which brought the entire nation to him. Remember that?) to meet the Prez and tell him – 'Mr. President. My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist.' And for what? Just because the love of his life – Mandira – told him to. I wonder what he would have done had she told him to go say 'Stop it man! You are making us all look bad!' to Osama bin Laden?And so during this journey, Khan meets an array of people who apparently don't really have a problem that he is a Muslim. The best part of the movie in terms of ridiculousness is when Khan finds himself in a church with a dozen African Americans and tells them ( (in Hindi of course, since it is the second language in all American schools and so everyone there knows it!) that Mandira's son was his 'best friend'. Not one scene existed when the kid seemed remotely interested in what was going on in either his mother's life or with stammering Khan who randomly gifts him shoes for no reason. This is where I lost all possible interest in the rest of it considering the climax became so obvious.My instincts about this movie being a giant load of cheesy performances and over the top 'Umreeki' reactions were bang on. Not only do we have an American cast just waiting to be salvaged from their racial ignorance by an autistic Indian Muslim, but he is also shown as some sort of messiah who becomes an inspiration for other Americans to help their own kind. Any ounce of credibility this story might have managed, gets vaporized at this spot when a crowd lead by his brother and sister-in- law leads a handful of Americans to aid in rescue efforts of a disaster area. The rest of the story is seriously predictable from this point on so I will let you waste your hard earned doe in experiencing this 'magic'.What aches me most about a movie like MNIK is that Johar decides to voice each and every thought Rizvan gets in his head. This, because he once again assumes his audience are so dumb, that they cant even digest this high school essay of a story. So while we have to put up with SRK's never ending, almost annoying, portrayal of a man with a serious disorder, we also have to contend with Kajol's wide eyed histrionics that oscillate from meaninglessly irrational to just plain absurd. I look around me and find leading websites announcing this as SRK's finest till date and it hurts me. How can they possibly call this a performance that overtakes 'Swades' or 'Chak De'? Is it because this is the first movie where he plays an 'unconventional' hero with a medical condition? Puhleez. Anyone who cites this as the reason isn't qualified to be a reviewer.If the audience who watches this so called 'movie about peace in Islam' that only highlights racial stereotypes calls it a successful attempt then surely it is a sad day in Indian cinema. I would prefer the movie 'Aamir' ten times more just because it was honest in its statements instead of choosing to design its script based on newspaper articles from a decade ago.",much ado about

10,KHANtastic movie !!,"This is one of the best Bollywood movie I've seen so far. MNIK is awesome. Its a must watch for every human being. Its a movie for humanity. The way Shahrukh Khan has projected himself as an autistic patient is just awesome. Kudos to him. This is by far his best acting. After this movie, he has proved why he is called The King of Bollywood. He is in a league of his own. No one is even close to him. I have loved the movie. You will not be able to take away your eyes for a single minute in this 160mins movie. This is just fabulous. Kajol as Mandira was awesome too. She had played an excellent character and supported SRK very well. Their chemistry is to die for. Few moments in the movie will make you cry. The way he goes to an only Christian event and donates the money and says ""Take this money for the Africans who are not Christians, darling"" is awesome. This movie will be an all-time blockbuster. Go and Watch this movie !!",khantastic movie,this is one best bollywood movie ive seen so far mnik is awesome its must watch every human being its movie humanity way shahrukh khan has projected himself as autistic patient is just awesome kudos him this is by far his best acting after this movie he has proved why he is called king bollywood he is league his own no one is even close him i have loved movie you will not be able take away your eyes single minute this 160mins movie this is just fabulous kajol as mandira was awesome too she had played excellent character supported srk very well their chemistry is die few moments movie will make you cry way he goes only christian event donates money says take this money africans who are not christians darling is awesome this movie will be all time blockbuster go watch this movie,0.6161564625850341,0.43469387755102046,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.35}"
