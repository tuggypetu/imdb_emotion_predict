10.0,A perfect example of gripping storytelling and impeccable characterisation,"Just returned from the theatres, now that I am home I feel genuinely very happy that Guru Kanth Desai is still going strong. I am also completely confident he will make Shakthi Corporation the biggest company in the world...by now you must be wondering what I am talking about, this is how many viewers would feel after coming out of watching Maniratnam's Guru.First of all let me start by mentioning Abhishek Bachan's role, as this is the role that Guru is built upon. If there ever was a movie where one actor dominated so completely I would only compare Kamal Hassan in Nayakudu/Nayakan. Abhishek should be very proud of what he has accomplished in Guru, it is something that some actors haven't or will not achieve in a life time. He is impeccable for the hardest of critic to comment. His histrionics are brilliant and the way he lost and gained weight during different parts of the movie demonstrate how serious Maniratnam and Abhishek were in making this movie. Keep the awards ready please...Abhishek Bachan has his name stamped on them.The story is quite simple; it is the narration and the characterisation that makes this movie so unique and interesting. it's about a common mans journey to build India's largest company with the help of its share holders by whatever means possible. In Guru, Guru Kanth Desai is not portrayed as an invincible man rather he is played as a very good business man who can talk and do right things at the right time. The narration of the story is so tight you never flinch. (This applies only to serious movie watchers, not the ones who cannot do without masala and comedy in a film) Maniratnam is one the best story tellers in our country if not the best, and he does that perfectly again. This will rate as one of the best works of Maniratnam; I would take the liberty of putting this Under Nayakudu/Nayakan which rates first on my list of Maniratnam movies.The music is by A R Rahman, we all know what happens when Maniratnam and A R Rahman team up. Pure magic is created. More than the songs of Guru, the background score impressed me. It is the music in every important scene that brings the scene to life. Rahman is amazing and like Rang De Basanti the songs just blend into the movie. Not to mention Mayya Mayya and Barso re Megha in the first 20 minutes of the movie brighten up the whole theatre.A word of mention...Aishwarya Rai has a very strong role in Guru; strong roles are very scarce in Bollywood these days...especially for female artists. Aishwarya stays with Guru throughout the movie and stays on the top of Bollywood by doing that brilliantly.Mithun & Madhavan are the adamant characters that fight for the right, when I say adamant they really are in the movie and you feel their willingness to stay on the right side of things all through the movie. All the other supporting roles including Vidhya Balan are brilliantly enacted. There is no character that was underplayed or wasn't justified.Where does this leave us...? Maniratnam has made a wonderful movie full of strong characters, great screen play, brilliant music and marvellous photography by Rajiv Menon. He needs to be commended for this effort. It is no wonder he takes two years to make out one movie, Guru was worth waiting for...so here I am already waiting for his next",perfect example gripping storytelling impeccable characterisation,just returned theatres now that i am home i feel genuinely very happy that guru kanth desai is still going strong i am also completely confident he will make shakthi corporation biggest company world by now you must be wondering what i am talking about this is how many viewers would feel after coming out watching maniratnams guru first all let me start by mentioning abhishek bachans role as this is role that guru is built upon if there ever was movie where one actor dominated so completely i would only compare kamal hassan nayakudu nayakan abhishek should be very proud what he has accomplished guru it is something that some actors havent or will not achieve life time he is impeccable hardest critic comment his histrionics are brilliant way he lost gained weight during different parts movie demonstrate how serious maniratnam abhishek were making this movie keep awards ready please abhishek bachan has his name stamped them story is quite simple it is narration characterisation that makes this movie so unique interesting its about common mans journey build indias largest company with help its share holders by whatever means possible guru guru kanth desai is not portrayed as invincible man rather he is played as very good business man who can talk do right things at right time narration story is so tight you never flinch this applies only serious movie watchers not ones who cannot do without masala comedy film maniratnam is one best story tellers our country if not best he does that perfectly again this will rate as one best works maniratnam i would take liberty putting this under nayakudu nayakan which rates first my list maniratnam movies music is by r rahman we all know what happens when maniratnam r rahman team up pure magic is created more than songs guru background score impressed me it is music every important scene that brings scene life rahman is amazing like rang de basanti songs just blend into movie not mention mayya mayya barso re megha first 20 minutes movie brighten up whole theatre word mention aishwarya rai has very strong role guru strong roles are very scarce bollywood these days especially female artists aishwarya stays with guru throughout movie stays top bollywood by doing that brilliantly mithun madhavan are adamant characters that fight right when i say adamant they really are movie you feel their willingness stay right side things all through movie all other supporting roles including vidhya balan are brilliantly enacted there is no character that was underplayed or wasnt justified where does this leave us maniratnam has made wonderful movie full strong characters great screen play brilliant music marvellous photography by rajiv menon he needs be commended this effort it is no wonder he takes two years make out one movie guru was worth waiting so here i am already waiting his next,0.6467309145880574,0.38865457294028716,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Want inspiration...watch Guru....it is overwhelmingly energetic!!!!!,"We went to watch the late night show of Guru on Sunday evening and I must admit, in recent times, it was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life. There was not one moment which i regretted while watching this wonderful movie with the best in all departments. Full marks to Mani Ratnam and the whole cast. It is difficult to come out of a movie happy, yet charmed and to feel so proud of astute vision (also,to be an Indian if you are overseas!) Before I start raving about Abhishek and Aishwarya..have a couple of important things to do. Even the smallest roles (Abhishek's father, his mother,Aishwarya's father, her mother,the committee head and so many others) were done sincerely by actors who are very good at what they do but are unsung heroes in Indian Cinema..I mean i do see them in good, intense roles but because there is no glamor attached, I cannot recall their names. A friend of mine suggested that I should give a balanced review by adding some bads of the movie too....huh!!was initially tough for me, since I was so overwhelmed;On serious thoughts, I thought let me do the worst job and then start the raves and praises!!!!!but come to think of it....here are some of my objections....there were too many songs;initially back-to-back (with my husband groaning..""oh no, not another song!!!!"");I kept asking what happened to Jhignis (Aishwarya's brother) because he just disappeared;when Aishwarya and Abhishek broke up, the scene shook me, but I did not understand why it broke into my most favourite song...""Aye Hairathe""!!!; And last but not the least, Mithun da deserved more screen time, given his powerful performance!!Nonetheless, this media called cinema has matchless power to shape and influence minds. The analogy drawn with Dhirubhai Ambani was just too good! I mean I know about his milestone work in industry, trade and commerce, but never would have wanted to read a biography on him. Now I am really curious and am inclined to dig the net.Let me clarify, not to come out and mock on how he made it big by breaking/making/kicking/obeying rules. But to know more about VISIONARY and ENTREPRENEURIAL thinking!! One of the most touching statements to prove this point were made by Abhishek Bachan (Gurubhai)when he justified his stand. He said to the tune of ""I saluted when asked to salute;I kicked when asked to kick, now why ask why did you kick so much and salute so much??"") reflected how bureaucracy, heavy entry barriers and closed doors policy in India stiffled business growth in that era. A typical 'rags to riches' story (I am stealing my husband's expression:D) but done so well with 'into the character' acting by everybody. How Abhishek managed to get all the Gujju expression (just part of his character) to portray his larger than life vision in life speaks volumes about his homework for this film. Being born and brought up in that region myself(Western India), I am totally familiar with local talk-walk!! He looked so ordinary, yet he did such extra-ordinary things!! In fact, in this context, the actor-character line looked so bleak. I did not know whom to reckon with more, with Abhishek for being Abhishek Bachan the son of Amitabh Bachan or with the so obvious Dhirubhai reference!! Aiswarya Rai was so down-to-earth, identifiable in this movie. I really liked her work and also appreciated how she chose to dance a little awkwardly in 'Barso Re Megha Megha' (despite the fact that she is a perfect dancer) just to portray that rusty, village belly gal!! I love to listen and listen to some of the songs, especially 'Aye Hairathe' which is so soulful, so meaningful, so heart rending!! Mithun Chakravarty played Nanaji so effortlessly; Have to agree that everybody was so right in their own shoes in this movie whether it was to promote the virtue of honesty, simplicity, clear vision or simple regard and respect for spouses, elders etc; that it was difficult to point out who was right and who was wrong. Mithun did not come out as a villain neither did Madhavan. Even I knew that Guru had paved his path with dirt smeared here and there, he did not seem to wrong at all. It was a true work which is really inspiring and totally keeps you thinking!! Wonder if Abhishek Bachan will get the National Award of not....hope he does...:) From my side, everybody on the crew deserves one!!",want inspiration watch guru it is overwhelmingly energetic,we went watch late night show guru sunday evening i must admit recent times it was one most wonderful experiences my life there was not one moment which i regretted while watching this wonderful movie with best all departments full marks mani ratnam whole cast it is difficult come out movie happy yet charmed feel so proud astute vision also be indian if you are overseas before i start raving about abhishek aishwarya have couple important things do even smallest roles abhisheks father his mother aishwaryas father her mother committee head so many others were done sincerely by actors who are very good at what they do but are unsung heroes indian cinema i mean i do see them good intense roles but because there is no glamor attached i cannot recall their names friend mine suggested that i should give balanced review by adding some bads movie too huh was initially tough me since i was so overwhelmed serious thoughts i thought let me do worst job then start raves praises but come think it here are some my objections there were too many songs initially back back with my husband groaning oh no not another song i kept asking what happened jhignis aishwaryas brother because he just disappeared when aishwarya abhishek broke up scene shook me but i did not understand why it broke into my most favourite song aye hairathe last but not least mithun da deserved more screen time given his powerful performance nonetheless this media called cinema has matchless power shape influence minds analogy drawn with dhirubhai ambani was just too good i mean i know about his milestone work industry trade commerce but never would have wanted read biography him now i am really curious am inclined dig net let me clarify not come out mock how he made it big by breaking making kicking obeying rules but know more about visionary entrepreneurial thinking one most touching statements prove this point were made by abhishek bachan gurubhai when he justified his stand he said tune i saluted when asked salute i kicked when asked kick now why ask why did you kick so much salute so much reflected how bureaucracy heavy entry barriers closed doors policy india stiffled business growth that era typical rags riches story i am stealing my husbands expression d but done so well with into character acting by everybody how abhishek managed get all gujju expression just part his character portray his larger than life vision life speaks volumes about his homework this film being born brought up that region myself western india i am totally familiar with local talk walk he looked so ordinary yet he did such extra ordinary things fact this context actor character line looked so bleak i did not know whom reckon with more with abhishek being abhishek bachan son amitabh bachan or with so obvious dhirubhai reference aiswarya rai was so down earth identifiable this movie i really liked her work also appreciated how she chose dance little awkwardly barso re megha megha despite fact that she is perfect dancer just portray that rusty village belly gal i love listen listen some songs especially aye hairathe which is so soulful so meaningful so heart rending mithun chakravarty played nanaji so effortlessly have agree that everybody was so right their own shoes this movie whether it was promote virtue honesty simplicity clear vision or simple regard respect spouses elders etc that it was difficult point out who was right who was wrong mithun did not come out as villain neither did madhavan even i knew that guru had paved his path with dirt smeared here there he did not seem wrong at all it was true work which is really inspiring totally keeps you thinking wonder if abhishek bachan will get national award not hope he does my side everybody crew deserves one,0.5733648758648757,0.16794210419210417,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,"The story of anomalies in the pre-liberalization Indian business situation.... through the story of Guru Kant Desai, an ordinary entrepreneur.","Mani Ratnam does it again ... outstanding!! With his vivid dramatization of the Indian business situation of the 1950s-1980s (pre-liberalization period), through the story of an ordinary entrepreneur, he surely aims at igniting the educated Indian minds towards entrepreneurship. Yes! The movie is not for everyone, but a focused audience !! The movie is not one of the eye-candy commercial movies .... but a typical Mani Ratnam product.But, more than anyone else, the one who turns the heat on is.... Abhishek Bachchan. ""Role-of-a-lifetime"", as they call it, could not have been better portrayed. And Abhishek Bachchan fits the role, body and soul. The conviction is evident in his dialog delivery at each and every stage of the story.Aishwarya Rai plays the role of the strong wife who would stand with her husband in all times. This is one of the times when she has proved more than her body. A strong role played with equal strength.The movie compactly binds the story of a successful entrepreneur and his simple love life. The soul of the movie lies in the final minutes, in a court hearing scene ... the 4 min 30 sec speech by Guru (Abhishek Bachchan). In his speech, Guru summarizes the anomalies of the pre-liberalization Indian business situation...how ""Licence Raj"", Market Imperfections, Corruption, Excise duties, Import-Export regulations troubled the businessmen and hindered the growth of the economy and nation as a whole.A feast for Indian intellectuals !!!

8.0,"Failed by family, system - how do you fight?","The beautiful photography of India, superb acting, and realistically told modern historical story make Guru a good choice as an eye-opener for someone who doesn't know Bollywood so well. And though the music is extraordinary, there is also somewhat less of it than sometimes.Guru is the story of the rise of a man from a village to become the owner of maybe the most successful business in India (a textiles manufacturer), which also benefited its mass of middle-class shareholders in an unprecedented way. It spans 30 years. The film is said to be based closely on the story of a real person. It seems intended to inspire Indians to overcome the obstacles presented by corrupt practices, and it raises the question as to what is the appropriate response to a closed and corrupt system that forecloses legitimate opportunity.It is a joy to find oneself in the hands of a master like Mani Ratnam.  I'd wondered if I'd find this movie at all dull or slow: I did not.  It moves along - there's a lot of plot going on all the time.  I would guess that we get from Guru's village origins to his years working in Turkey to his arrival in Bombay as an adult ready to go into business in less than 20 minutes. Abhishek Bachchan gave a lovely performance as the son of a village schoolteacher who isn't much of a student, to his father's dismay. He declares his intention to have his own business, and disregards his harsh father's negative predictions about his prospects.  The character, Gurukant Desai, has a wonderful spirit - doesn't take no for an answer, also can laugh off irritants and obstacles, and the laugh is charming, at once boyish and manly.  He's ""big"" as a personality, and Abhishek is emotionally and physically up to it - you feel his great reserves of self-regard in the various ways he meets opposition, whether from family or business-world characters.One of my primary responses to seeing the film today was gratitude to be able to see it on a big screen.  The movie occurs in city and countryside, the 50s through the 80s. Every visual image, and the whole field of the movie - scenes, sets, costumes, ambiance, acting style, music - worked together to tell an appealing story with a strong appreciation for India, as well as a potential inspiration and warning.  I think a good test of a bio-pic, or pseudo-bio-pic, is whether or not somebody who doesn't know much of anything about the putative subject, which is me (in this case, the reference subject is a super-businessman named Ambani), experiences the story as having integrity, and for me this entirely passes that test. And it's nice to see a Hindi movie in which parental disapproval is met with a ""cut your losses"" response rather than the sometimes maudlin kind of pining or carrying on about an ""incomplete"" life we often run into.  Moreover, this dynamic is not at all irrelevant to other levels of meaning in a story about a man in India who take on large defeatist cultural expectations to achieve success.  How should we respond to Father or principles or rules that are truly not serving our interests? It is also not irrelevant to how he plays his hand in relation to the corruption and cronyism he meets when he goes to Bombay to make his way.Aishwarya is fine in a wife-from-the-village role who is a partner all the way, and I love her dancing. She also shows a definitely womanly aspect as the movie goes on. I am glad to see her in a role that does not confine her to the vulnerable-verging-on-breakable girl she is sometimes stuck in.Mithun Chakravorty (of Disco Dancer fame) was  nothing but perfect as a newspaper owner who was a father figure to Gurukant and also significantly opposed some of his decisions.  The presentation of that complex relationship is a giant strength of the movie.  I don't recall running into this before, a scenario where an older generation figure is out to bring down a ""son"" and the love between them is dramatized as going on nonetheless.  I found it emotionally powerful, and insofar as there is a background allegory about India, excellent, about opposing and maintaining ties.In a subplot that I couldn't find the rationale for, Vidya Balan as a lame girl and Madhavan as a journalist with high ideals and non-idealistic practices were appealing and romantic.",failed by family system how do you fight,beautiful photography india superb acting realistically told modern historical story make guru good choice as eye opener someone who doesnt know bollywood so well though music is extraordinary there is also somewhat less it than sometimes guru is story rise man village become owner maybe most successful business india textiles manufacturer which also benefited its mass middle class shareholders unprecedented way it spans 30 years film is said be based closely story real person it seems intended inspire indians overcome obstacles presented by corrupt practices it raises question as what is appropriate response closed corrupt system that forecloses legitimate opportunity it is joy find oneself hands master like mani ratnam id wondered if id find this movie at all dull or slow i did not it moves along theres lot plot going all time i would guess that we get gurus village origins his years working turkey his arrival bombay as adult ready go into business less than 20 minutes abhishek bachchan gave lovely performance as son village schoolteacher who isnt much student his fathers dismay he declares his intention have his own business disregards his harsh fathers negative predictions about his prospects character gurukant desai has wonderful spirit doesnt take no answer also can laugh off irritants obstacles laugh is charming at once boyish manly hes big as personality abhishek is emotionally physically up it you feel his great reserves self regard various ways he meets opposition whether family or business world characters one my primary responses seeing film today was gratitude be able see it big screen movie occurs city countryside 50s through 80s every visual image whole field movie scenes sets costumes ambiance acting style music worked together tell appealing story with strong appreciation india as well as potential inspiration warning i think good test bio pic or pseudo bio pic is whether or not somebody who doesnt know much anything about putative subject which is me this case reference subject is super businessman named ambani experiences story as having integrity me this entirely passes that test its nice see hindi movie which parental disapproval is met with cut your losses response rather than sometimes maudlin kind pining or carrying about incomplete life we often run into moreover this dynamic is not at all irrelevant other levels meaning story about man india who take large defeatist cultural expectations achieve success how should we respond father or principles or rules that are truly not serving our interests it is also not irrelevant how he plays his hand relation corruption cronyism he meets when he goes bombay make his way aishwarya is fine wife village role who is partner all way i love her dancing she also shows definitely womanly aspect as movie goes i am glad see her role that does not confine her vulnerable verging breakable girl she is sometimes stuck mithun chakravorty disco dancer fame was nothing but perfect as newspaper owner who was father figure gurukant also significantly opposed some his decisions presentation that complex relationship is giant strength movie i dont recall running into this before scenario where older generation figure is out bring down son love between them is dramatized as going nonetheless i found it emotionally powerful insofar as there is background allegory about india excellent about opposing maintaining ties subplot that i couldnt find rationale vidya balan as lame girl madhavan as journalist with high ideals non idealistic practices were appealing romantic,0.5146380178087495,0.1985007742934572,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,doesn't meet expectations but it's an okay one-time watch,"Ever since Mani Ratnam's 'Yuva', I've lost my positive expectations for his films. My feelings were similar for 'Guru' but people kept mentioning what a masterpiece it was. So I decided to give it a chance. Sadly, the movie is miles away from being a masterpiece. I am not saying that it is bad. For me it is just a one time watch. The movie drags on mostly with its tiringly sluggish pace. At parts it is very boring. Mani Ratnam's direction is OK. It just simply does not compare to his earlier works like 'Roja', 'Bumbai' and 'Dil se'. Another point where these three films succeeded and where 'Guru' fails is the performances from the protagonists. Abhishek certainly has tried to give his best for Guru but that just is not good enough. He is okay in a few scenes, he hams a lot at most parts and he is wooden at the rest. Also someone should tell Abhishek that to play a more mature character, only makeup is not enough. However, it is highly likely that he will win best actor for this movie. In my opinion, he is a complete miscast. To date I would say his best performance (and only decent performance) is in 'Phir Milenge'. Aishwarya gets no scope. She is cast as a typical heroine (in a male biopic) and lacks the ability to make something extraordinary out of something ordinary. There is a lack of chemistry between the lovers.In contrast, Vidya Balan's character is totally insignificant to the main plot but she shines above all and more than makes her presence felt by delivering an excellent performance. Mithun is outstanding and Madhavan is brilliant. A.R. Rahman's score is good. However, this is far from his best work. The Maiya Maiya item number was completely irrelevant. What was Mallika Sherawat doing there playing a Turkish girl who's singing in Arabic? Background score was overused and at times ruins the moments of the scenes. The movie is very predictable. In my opinion, this is already one of the most overrated movies of the year.",doesnt meet expectations but its okay one time watch,ever since mani ratnams yuva ive lost my positive expectations his films my feelings were similar guru but people kept mentioning what masterpiece it was so i decided give it chance sadly movie is miles away being masterpiece i am not saying that it is bad me it is just one time watch movie drags mostly with its tiringly sluggish pace at parts it is very boring mani ratnams direction is ok it just simply does not compare his earlier works like roja bumbai dil se another point where these three films succeeded where guru fails is performances protagonists abhishek certainly has tried give his best guru but that just is not good enough he is okay few scenes he hams lot at most parts he is wooden at rest also someone should tell abhishek that play more mature character only makeup is not enough however it is highly likely that he will win best actor this movie my opinion he is complete miscast date i would say his best performance only decent performance is phir milenge aishwarya gets no scope she is cast as typical heroine male biopic lacks ability make something extraordinary out something ordinary there is lack chemistry between lovers contrast vidya balans character is totally insignificant main plot but she shines above all more than makes her presence felt by delivering excellent performance mithun is outstanding madhavan is brilliant r rahmans score is good however this is far his best work maiya maiya item number was completely irrelevant what was mallika sherawat doing there playing turkish girl whos singing arabic background score was overused at times ruins moments scenes movie is very predictable my opinion this is already one most overrated movies year,0.5503269300144301,0.18190746753246753,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8.0,A perfect wedding gift,"Mani Ratnam's Guru holds forte for the whole movie period and lets it off at the end. The enthralling story of the rags to riches is a true tribute to Dhirubhai and his business acumen. It is also a peek into the way business is and should be run in present times. The shackles of the licence raj and how the protagonist Gurukant Desai breaks them is beautifully depicted. The fearless Guru makeshis way wherever he goes. It also shows that in today's business education or the lack of it is no deterrent. Dhirubhai and Bill Gates are examples of this . Gurukant enacted by Abhishek lives up to the character. The smiling face, the twinkle in the eye shows that he is confident of himself. The interactions are also at extremes, with the snobbish he is rude but with the friends and relatives he is subdues. A heady mixture of earthy charm and brilliance is what Abhishek shows in a neatly drawn character of Guru. Ash as his wife who has lost in love and marries Guru out of no choice is also restrained and supports Guru not getting awed by the brilliance of the character and showing the strength that was trademark of Dhirubhai's wife Kokilaben. Mithun Chakravarty shows flashes of his Mrigayaa brilliance in the character of the media baron and how his love turns into hate and how he goes on to be the ruthless media baron after he knows that Guru has used his media is a fine effort by a veteran actor. Vidya Balan acts well but her life and death are not well integrated into the story and bear no relevance to Guru and his life. Madhavan too as the journalist in the cameo acts well. The story of a rural boy who goes to Istanbul to trade and comes back to India to set up his own business, marries for the sake of dowry to set up his business, finds his way through the market, sets up his textile plants , takes care of his shareholders , gets into trouble with the Government in his fast rise , is paralyzed, fights back and comes out a winner. Guru is ruthless and shows no emotion for what is right or wrong . This is shown by his marrying Ash for the need of 25000 rupees as seed capital. He again uses the newspaper of his Nanaji to get the membership. He bribes officials and ministers to get clearances. This shows that all is fair in war and business. The only weak point in the movie is that after building up the second half with misery for Guru, the jury makes up its mind to punish Guru. Only one lecture of Guru makes the learned men overturn their decision . The lecture is not logical. Its emotional. Here also Guru is more interested in the public trial and makes the most of it. But the sequence in which he equates himself with Gandhiji does not bear semblance to Dhirubhai and brings the movie to an abrupt end as if a racing car comes to a screeching halt.

8.0,"Great movie by Mani Ratnam; but, Abhsihek steals the show","This movie is all about the vision of a person  Gurukanth Desai (Abhishek Bachchan) & his efforts to realize the dream, fighting against all odds. Some people say it is based on the life of Dhirubhai Ambani. I can see why they say so. But, this is actually a movie about a simple guy trying to make it big in this world. It can easily relate to just about any successful entrepreneur who has been able to achieve his vision.This movie follows Guru's journey, starting from his teenage days; his first work in the petrol industry in Turkey. As he matures in age as well as in riches, he decides to start working for himself & begins his ""bijjness""- His foundation stone & his first business takeover being his marriage with Sujatha (Aishwarya Rai). He steps into Bombay and bids to cut out his own route in textile trading, through the weed-infested fields of the trading unions. His entry into trading, is greatly influenced by the works of a news editor with great principles, Manikdas Gupta (Mithun Chakraborthy). The relationship between these two, then, goes on to progress to a father-son standard. Flanked by his innovative ideas & his sole will of realizing his dreams, he dares to foray into other areas, manufacturing polyester, producing chemicals etc.But, as we near intermission, an important incident occurs, which makes Mithunda to take notice of the ways & means of Guru's success. To investigate Guru's work, he appoints a young reporter, Shyam Saxena (R Madhavan). This is where the story really starts developing its many twists & turns; involving many intricate plots bearing great emotion, building up wonderfully to a Grand Finale worth the huge expectations from this film.Mani Ratnam as the Director does a commendable job of realizing his screenplay dreams. His attention to detail in every aspect of the movie is commendable, be it the evolution in the type of clothing which the characters wear or the concept of using different shades of colors for different decades in the movie, there is typical Mani Ratnam uniqueness written all over it. High points in the movie are the sequences between Mithunda & Guru, the simple chemistry between Aishwarya & Abhishek & of course, the Finale. The cinematography by Rajiv Menon is very nice, capturing the essence of the India of the bygone days. The editing though good for the most parts, was a little too flashy for my liking towards the end.The music by AR Rahman is another huge point going in favor of the movie. The soulful song & tune of ""Jaage Hain"" & the ravishing song ""Tera Bina"" are pieces of musical brilliance. ""Barso Re"" is a melodious number, shot very beautifully with nice choreography. ARR plays his charm though his innovative & fresh music.Coming to the performances, the beauty queen  Aishwarya Rai has given a wonderful performance, suiting her strong character in the movie. This is one of the few occasions, where her acting has done the talking & not only the looks. Madhavan does justice to the role of the sincere journalist. Vidya Balan runs her charm in the brief, but, important role she plays; portraying her unrelenting love for her quarreling caretakers. Mithun Chakraborthy's comeback role is the best that I've seen coming from this Disco dancer of yesteryears. He is involved in a few quite memorable scenes in the movie, adding his charm. Mallika Sherawath fans would be disappointed to find out that she doesn't have any role in the movie at all, except for a song.But, this movie belongs to Abhishek Bachchan & none other. This is the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play such an important role & he has grabbed it with both hands. This is not a typical hero's role, which he portrays. There is the interesting addition of grayish shades to his character. His choice of role means that he probably wont have too many of his female fans swooning over him during the movie; but, it is his acting which steals the show here. He graces almost every frame with his presence. His dialogue delivery is immaculate, his energy & confidence in the movie is truly breathtaking, towering over all the other good performances in the movie.",great movie by mani ratnam but abhsihek steals show,this movie is all about vision person gurukanth desai abhishek bachchan his efforts realize dream fighting against all odds some people say it is based life dhirubhai ambani i can see why they say so but this is actually movie about simple guy trying make it big this world it can easily relate just about any successful entrepreneur who has been able achieve his vision this movie follows gurus journey starting his teenage days his first work petrol industry turkey as he matures age as well as riches he decides start working himself begins his bijjness his foundation stone his first business takeover being his marriage with sujatha aishwarya rai he steps into bombay bids cut out his own route textile trading through weed infested fields trading unions his entry into trading is greatly influenced by works news editor with great principles manikdas gupta mithun chakraborthy relationship between these two then goes progress father son standard flanked by his innovative ideas his sole will realizing his dreams he dares foray into other areas manufacturing polyester producing chemicals etc but as we near intermission important incident occurs which makes mithunda take notice ways means gurus success investigate gurus work he appoints young reporter shyam saxena r madhavan this is where story really starts developing its many twists turns involving many intricate plots bearing great emotion building up wonderfully grand finale worth huge expectations this film mani ratnam as director does commendable job realizing his screenplay dreams his attention detail every aspect movie is commendable be it evolution type clothing which characters wear or concept using different shades colors different decades movie there is typical mani ratnam uniqueness written all over it high points movie are sequences between mithunda guru simple chemistry between aishwarya abhishek course finale cinematography by rajiv menon is very nice capturing essence india bygone days editing though good most parts was little too flashy my liking towards end music by ar rahman is another huge point going favor movie soulful song tune jaage hain ravishing song tera bina are pieces musical brilliance barso re is melodious number shot very beautifully with nice choreography arr plays his charm though his innovative fresh music coming performances beauty queen aishwarya rai has given wonderful performance suiting her strong character movie this is one few occasions where her acting has done talking not only looks madhavan does justice role sincere journalist vidya balan runs her charm brief but important role she plays portraying her unrelenting love her quarreling caretakers mithun chakraborthys comeback role is best that ive seen coming this disco dancer yesteryears he is involved few quite memorable scenes movie adding his charm mallika sherawath fans would be disappointed find out that she doesnt have any role movie at all except song but this movie belongs abhishek bachchan none other this is once lifetime opportunity play such important role he has grabbed it with both hands this is not typical heros role which he portrays there is interesting addition grayish shades his character his choice role means that he probably wont have too many his female fans swooning over him during movie but it is his acting which steals show here he graces almost every frame with his presence his dialogue delivery is immaculate his energy confidence movie is truly breathtaking towering over all other good performances movie,0.5418495514147689,0.2878381642512078,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Even Dhirubhai couldn't have written a better autobiography,"Well, Maniratnam has proved his worth as a director. To be able to make a hero out of somebody like Dhirubhai requires great skills. Not to mention that he made an excellent movie even with Ms Rai in it. (why did he cast her in that movie - did he lose a bet or was that a contractual thing for casting Mr. Bachan? Or was Tabu unavailable?) At the end of the movie the audience are most likely to come to the following conclusions: 1. Guru is a courageous, in-your-face, kind of entrepreneurial genius. 2. People such as Guru are the key to the success of our country and to the elimination of poverty 3. Guru is a hero of the poor people fighting for them against the club going, golf playing, influenced by the west, rich clique who prevented others from coming into their group with the help of the license raj, 4. People who stand up against corruption are honest, good people but really who are we kidding, do we really need these jokers? and 5. a small side issue is that the role of good women is at the side of their genius husbands even when they are treated as start-up capital. However, these are my questions: 1. If the poor are poor is it really because they are either lazy, or scared, or simply idiots. I wonder what would Mohd. Yunus of Grameen Bank have to say about this? 2. According to the movie people like Guru benefited 30 million people. In a country of 1 billion is 30million that much? It is just 0.3%. Not to mention these ""poor people"" had to be people who were at least of middle class status and living in cities. 3. Yes, it is true that the license raj did fetter the rise of dynamic capitalists - but will somebody ever talk about those toiling masses of this country who work until death to make this country run and people like Guru trilionaires? 4. And will someone ever say anything against making heroes of not only persons who are geniuses at exploiting others but also those who take dowry? what happened to all that social conscience of ours? It makes me very sad when talented film makers such as Maniratnam make such movies. Miracles can happen and may be Maniratnam will find his conscience....someday....",even dhirubhai couldnt have written better autobiography,well maniratnam has proved his worth as director be able make hero out somebody like dhirubhai requires great skills not mention that he made excellent movie even with ms rai it why did he cast her that movie did he lose bet or was that contractual thing casting mr bachan or was tabu unavailable at end movie audience are most likely come following conclusions 1 guru is courageous your face kind entrepreneurial genius 2 people such as guru are key success our country elimination poverty 3 guru is hero poor people fighting them against club going golf playing influenced by west rich clique who prevented others coming into their group with help license raj 4 people who stand up against corruption are honest good people but really who are we kidding do we really need these jokers 5 small side issue is that role good women is at side their genius husbands even when they are treated as start up capital however these are my questions 1 if poor are poor is it really because they are either lazy or scared or simply idiots i wonder what would mohd yunus grameen bank have say about this 2 according movie people like guru benefited 30 million people country 1 billion is 30million that much it is just 0 3 not mention these poor people had be people who were at least middle class status living cities 3 yes it is true that license raj did fetter rise dynamic capitalists but will somebody ever talk about those toiling masses this country who work until death make this country run people like guru trilionaires 4 will someone ever say anything against making heroes not only persons who are geniuses at exploiting others but also those who take dowry what happened all that social conscience ours it makes me very sad when talented film makers such as maniratnam make such movies miracles can happen may be maniratnam will find his conscience someday,0.5515765765765764,0.13265765765765763,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,Great Attempt but only good execution....,"Let me be frank I had no intention of watching this movie, the only reason I watched this movie was because my family dragged me to it. I am very apprehensive about watching dramas and ever since Mani Ratnam denied that this movie is based on Dhirubhai Ambani and named the character Guru I was sure I wasn't going to watch this film.The movie starts out OK enough, 15 mins into the movie you that Mani was lying and this movie is in fact completely based on Dhirubhai's life.The movie shows early signs of trying to be a formula flick though, WTF is an item-number doing in this film. Nevermind that, to add to itwe have the signature Mani Ratnam entry for the heroine with the song and dance (think Roja) and that to within 5-10 mins of the item-number what the hell.Still the first half entertains certain parts of his life have been whitewashed and modified to avoid lawsuits. For example Dhirubhai by his own admission made his fortune in Aden, Yemen not in the spice market but by smuggling Yemeni coins that contained silver at that time, he claims he made lakhs but came back to India with only 15,000 (did he use that money to bribe or blew it up god knows).Anyway the movie moves at a fast pace and even though you know the eventual outcome you want Guru to succeed and thats the biggest victory for the movie in the first half.You are willing to forget the songs,and the whitewashed storyline (maybe he did it because there was probably no way he could have used Dhiru's real name and shown anything but Superman, hence the change of minor details).You give him the benefit of the doubt and instead go with the flow of the movie, wishing from your heart that Guru wins.But the second half is a different ballgame. You are suddenly distracted by a Love Story involving the side characters (as if the extra-sweet and obviously fictitious scenes between Abhishek and Ash weren't enough).So here we have a man struggling with morality, on war with his godfather and in the middle of it we have two minor characters kissing in the rain . And how is this scene important to the movie?? To add to that you have couple of more songs, by the end of it, the supposedly most stirring scene of the movie,towards the end, ends up nothing more than a damp squib.You can literally feel the pulse of the audience dip after every song in the second half(which are far from good anyway what happened Mr. Rahman). A lot of the good done in the first half is washed away by the end of the movie.The acting of the movie is great throughout.Abhishek Bachan as expected steals the show and this is completely his movie and probably the first time he has carried an entire movie on his shoulders, hats of to him.On the other hand Ash did an ordinary job somehow she is not able to strike a chord with the audience,maybe be the fantastic acting all around her had something to do with it.Mithun was also brilliant giving a stellar performance as the powerful,idealistic yet humble publisher. Its great that he has decided to return to A-list films, we need other great actors of yesteryear's to come forward do roles that suit their age.Technically the film was nothing special(wasn't required anyway) yet the direction, cinematography etc met the standards of an A-list film.Another glaring flaw of the movie was that even though we spent 3 hours with the character we were still shown only a whitewashed uni-dimensional character, the fact that Guru was ruthless and corrupt and often put portrayed that he was doing things for the public good but instead did it mainly for his own (anyone who's owned a reliance will know what I'm talking about he-he).His corrupt practices we mentioned but in a passing manner inter-spread with the hyper-annoying love story. I mean we love the guy and we're not going to stop loving him just because you show us his other side, no ones perfect, it didn't make sense to only mention his malpractices and then not show us that element of his character.However the most enduring fact about the movie is that At least ITS FULLY ORIGINAL, no rehash of dozen English and Hindi movies here. Indian Cinema is at a loss for ideas and any movie with this amount of originality gets great bonus points for attempt I may not appreciate biopics in general but I really appreciated the originality.In all a good ORIGINAL movie that looses out in the second half but is worth watching if your looking for some family entertainment. Not the kind of movie you want to see with your friends (if you don't like such movies/Hindi movies etc allow yourself to be forced for this one, use the credit to get yourself out of watching movies like Ankahee).-s uni-dimensional portrayal, boring second half, distracting and ordinary songs (at best), unnecessary side love story (atleast no songs).+/-s Ash (i feel shes better of getting married and claiming she left on top),Abisheks good but round the clock publicity and announcement of marriage etc I've already overdosed.MOVIE Doesn't TAKE A STAND.+s super acting all around, Abhishek B, FINALLY AN ORIGINAL FILM, meets industry standards (techinically), many moments mainly in the first half that connect you to the movie.total 7+1/10 (the one is for the original attempt in absolute terms this movie is more of seven, this movie will be better remembered for the marriage announcement and the fact that Abhishek proved his mettle, than for the movie itself).",great attempt but only good execution,let me be frank i had no intention watching this movie only reason i watched this movie was because my family dragged me it i am very apprehensive about watching dramas ever since mani

,***** (5 out of 5 starts) GURU is a MUST-SEE,"***** (5/5 Stars) I'm going to have to disagree with the poster above -- ""Guru"" is one of the finest Indian/Bollywood films I've seen in a long time. I think identifying with ""Guru"" is easy to do from the start of the movie. What we have is a young person who wants to ""explore"" beyond his village and become great one day. The movie is about him trying to accomplish his dream of becoming great; this is surely a story that almost anyone can relate to. Abhishek's performance was absolutely marvelous, without spoiling anything, when you walk out the theater you will have actually felt moved by the last few scenes. No Indian film has managed to move me to tears -- this one did. My eyes got watery watching this character fight through all the struggles that come his way. The music was fantastic and really makes you ""think."" Indian movies have become clichéd with the 'love-sing-dance' style that has permeated to many movies. Also what you have is Indians copying too much of the American style films. What ""Guru"" is is a movie that takes pride in being Indian; it is an original story that more Bollywood movies should try to be. Be warned though: it is not a movie that is your typical ""razzle-dazzle"" entertain -- its a movie that makes you think, that has drama, and has strong acting, and that has a great plot. I loved Guru from the start to the finish; it wasn't a second too long or short. As an American-born with Indian roots, ""Guru"" fuses the best of both Indian and American cinema to produce a masterpiece. I hope you all enjoy it, Guru is a must-see.",5 out 5 starts guru is must see,5 5 stars im going have disagree with poster above guru is one finest indian bollywood films ive seen long time i think identifying with guru is easy do start movie what we have is young person who wants explore beyond his village become great one day movie is about him trying accomplish his dream becoming great this is surely story that almost anyone can relate abhisheks performance was absolutely marvelous without spoiling anything when you walk out theater you will have actually felt moved by last few scenes no indian film has managed move me tears this one did my eyes got watery watching this character fight through all struggles that come his way music was fantastic really makes you think indian movies have become clich d with love sing dance style that has permeated many movies also what you have is indians copying too much american style films what guru is is movie that takes pride being indian it is original story that more bollywood movies should try be be warned though it is not movie that is your typical razzle dazzle entertain its movie that makes you think that has drama has strong acting that has great plot i loved guru start finish it wasnt second too long or short as american born with indian roots guru fuses best both indian american cinema produce masterpiece i hope you all enjoy it guru is must see,0.4397569444444445,0.30078125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"
5.0,Inspiring movie with some flawed messages,"Rag-to-riches is not a phenomenon exclusive to America. Guru is a testimony to the fact that ambition, determination and perseverance can be a winning potion for any aspiring person, irrespective of nationality. The movie charts the life of Gurukanth Desai, the disowned son of a school headmaster, and his rise to the helm of the Indian business world from frugal and humble beginnings. Abhishek, Mithun and Vidya Balan offer excellent screen performances. Vidya Balan is by far the best. Her acting is surprisingly natural and original, unlike many of the well-known Bollywood names. As for Aishwarya, although she portrays the role of Guru's wife well, I believe that her acting is greatly over-hyped by the media and her accompanying stardom.I won't discuss the movie plot in detail as that has been repeated several times in different tones throughout the forum. Many viewers have related the movie to the life of Ambani, and although, there is a clear correlation between some of the movie ingredients (opening a business with an investment of fifteen thousand rupees, polyester factory, etc), some facts such as Guru's trip to Turkey are not entirely factual of Ambani's career. Overall, the movie has very powerful and inspiring messages for the ambitious. The character played by Guru portrays the image of a gung-ho, determined, resolute individual unwilling to bend under the inequalities of a society driven by greed. He epitomizes a timeless message of where there's a will there's a way.The reason why I give this movie 5 stars is that, while the first half of the movie is very involved and 'inspiring', in the second half Guru deviates from this image of a righteous role model, into a wealthy businessman symbolizing all the wrongs of the society.************** POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE ************** As Guru ascends into the echelon society, he inherits societal trends associated with greed and corruption. Mani Ratnam argues through his character that such vices are essential in order to succeed in business, but I cannot agree that it is alright to 'misrepresent the equity value of a firm', 'state fictional statements about foreign investments', etc all in the name of raising market capitalization, thereby increasing stock prices. I'm accustomed to these practices in the business world, and, as such, there are times when one needs to bend rules in order to succeed in an imperfect world. However, the abrupt, unwanted deviation from an ascetic do-good Guru to a capitalist commoner is disappointing. I'm afraid, Ratnam's message and argument that wrongdoings are acceptable as long as it benefits the public in light of a corporate world already wrought in umpteen scandals sends a very confusing message for the young. At that rate, Ken Lay would be still at the helm of Enron, and Arthur Anderson would still remain a distinguished firm. **************************************************Overall a fine movie, but you must watch it with a discerning and critical eye.",inspiring movie with some flawed messages,rag riches is not phenomenon exclusive america guru is testimony fact that ambition determination perseverance can be winning potion any aspiring person irrespective nationality movie charts life gurukanth desai disowned son school headmaster his rise helm indian business world frugal humble beginnings abhishek mithun vidya balan offer excellent screen performances vidya balan is by far best her acting is surprisingly natural original unlike many well known bollywood names as aishwarya although she portrays role gurus wife well i believe that her acting is greatly over hyped by media her accompanying stardom i wont discuss movie plot detail as that has been repeated several times different tones throughout forum many viewers have related movie life ambani although there is clear correlation between some movie ingredients opening business with investment fifteen thousand rupees polyester factory etc some facts such as gurus trip turkey are not entirely factual ambanis career overall movie has very powerful inspiring messages ambitious character played by guru portrays image gung ho determined resolute individual unwilling bend under inequalities society driven by greed he epitomizes timeless message where theres will theres way reason why i give this movie 5 stars is that while first half movie is very involved inspiring second half guru deviates this image righteous role model into wealthy businessman symbolizing all wrongs society possible spoiler here as guru ascends into echelon society he inherits societal trends associated with greed corruption mani ratnam argues through his character that such vices are essential order succeed business but i cannot agree that it is alright misrepresent equity value firm state fictional statements about foreign investments etc all name raising market capitalization thereby increasing stock prices im accustomed these practices business world as such there are times when one needs bend rules order succeed imperfect world however abrupt unwanted deviation ascetic do good guru capitalist commoner is disappointing im afraid ratnams message argument that wrongdoings are acceptable as long as it benefits public light corporate world already wrought umpteen scandals sends very confusing message young at that rate ken lay would be still at helm enron arthur anderson would still remain distinguished firm overall fine movie but you must watch it with discerning critical eye,0.5080864197530863,0.10848765432098767,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.6}"

The director ventures into a plot that is seldom touched in India: The plight of Indian Businessmen, the prejudice that the general public has towards them, the disgust with which they are seen.

The director covers a lot of ground in 2.30 hrs and nowhere it feels that the story is getting ahead of itself.

6.0,Is Guru good or Bad,"This is the question I left the theatre with. In many ways it applies to both the movie and its protagonist, Guru Himself.Guru is being raved about by the public at large but he is not without his flaws. That's the case with the movie as well. If I could forget the name of the director and the other movies he made in the past, Guru would have been a good, maybe even a very good movie. But sadly, being a great fan of Mani's other movies especially the likes of Kannathil Muthamittal (which many found dramatic, unrealistic and others even boring!), I could not expect anything less from Mani, could I? And that was the problem I had with Guru.I think (and it's my personal opinion), that Mani got a bit carried away and much like Gurukant Desai, was looking more for commercial Success! I don't mean to say that is wrong or maybe even true. But after watching all the publicity that Mani has been doing himself for the movie (which I haven't seen him do much in the past), apart from the media and public hysteria, Ash- Abhi engagement et al., the movie comes as a bit of disappointment to me.If direction only means getting the best performances from the cast, then Mani is spot on! I mean, how many directors can make ASH act?? The answer is none, other than Mani. Of course, other actors have done a great job as well, but that does not surprise me. Its Ash that came as a big surprise and I can truly say this is the first time I can associate the word pleasant surprise. (Well, I can't tell you how disgusted I was with her in Dhoom 2).But then, that's not the only thing I expect from Mani. I have always revelled at Mani's forte  his characterization. And that was the biggest let down for me in GURU. While he did justice to Gurukant Desai and Sujatha's character, he sadly lacked his original Midas touch. I have always believed that Mani could bring out the nuances of a character, major or minor is a scene or two. But in Guru, I thought he miserably failed to do so! Madhavan, Vidya Balan, Mithun and all the rest of the cast, seem to be floating in and out of the frame in a way very uncharacteristic of Mani! I can't help but wonder why Mani did that. I can still remember the scenes of his earlier movies, Nayagan and Bombay (well, guru is part the former and part the latter in many senses!) vividly, though I was very young when I saw former and fairly young during the latter. Yet, a single scene in those movies brought out every character beautifully. In guru, even after 4 or 5 scenes of Vidya Balan, Madhavan and you are left wondering about their presence. And that is something you just can't digest, only because it is a Mani's movie. These things wouldn't matter if some XYZ director had done the movie! The other biggest let down in the movie was the picturization of the songs. As beautiful and melodious the songs were, it is a big shock that, Mani with Menon failed to capitalize on them. Again probably because of the high standards the duo have set for themselves, it is difficult for me to expect something like this. Sadly, even 'Tere Bina' failed to have the effect that 'Snegidhane' had (on me!).May be it is not right to compare, maybe I am over critical and getting carried away. But then the fault for that as well lies with Mani. It is he, who after all set such high standards that I expect out of him.It would be unfair to take away the credit from the movie, especially to Abhishek who has evidently put in a lot of effort, to Aishwarya for finally acting in a movie and others (read Madhavan) who have agreed to do such half baked roles only for Mani! Well, then what I am saying, is the movie good or bad? Like you guys care! It is worth a watch, though, I'd say (especially if you don't have your expectations set as high as I had)!",is guru good or bad,this is question i left theatre with many ways it applies both movie its protagonist guru himself guru is being raved about by public at large but he is not without his flaws thats case with movie as well if i could forget name director other movies he made past guru would have been good maybe even very good movie but sadly being great fan manis other movies especially likes kannathil muthamittal which many found dramatic unrealistic others even boring i could not expect anything less mani could i that was problem i had with guru i think its my personal opinion that mani got bit carried away much like gurukant desai was looking more commercial success i dont mean say that is wrong or maybe even true but after watching all publicity that mani has been doing himself movie which i havent seen him do much past apart media public hysteria ash abhi engagement et al movie comes as bit disappointment me if direction only means getting best performances cast then mani is spot i mean how many directors can make ash act answer is none other than mani course other actors have done great job as well but that does not surprise me its ash that came as big surprise i can truly say this is first time i can associate word pleasant surprise well i cant tell you how disgusted i was with her dhoom 2 but then thats not only thing i expect mani i have always revelled at manis forte his characterization that was biggest let down me guru while he did justice gurukant desai sujathas character he sadly lacked his original midas touch i have always believed that mani could bring out nuances character major or minor is scene or two but guru i thought he miserably failed do so madhavan vidya balan mithun all rest cast seem be floating out frame way very uncharacteristic mani i cant help but wonder why mani did that i can still remember scenes his earlier movies nayagan bombay well guru is part former part latter many senses vividly though i was very young when i saw former fairly young during latter yet single scene those movies brought out every character beautifully guru even after 4 or 5 scenes vidya balan madhavan you are left wondering about their presence that is something you just cant digest only because it is manis movie these things wouldnt matter if some xyz director had done movie other biggest let down movie was picturization songs as beautiful melodious songs were it is big shock that mani with menon failed capitalize them again probably because high standards duo have set themselves it is difficult me expect something like this sadly even tere bina failed have effect that snegidhane had me may be it is not right compare maybe i am over critical getting carried away but then fault that as well lies with mani it is he who after all set such high standards that i expect out him it would be unfair take away credit movie especially abhishek who has evidently put lot effort aishwarya finally acting movie others read madhavan who have agreed do such half baked roles only mani well then what i am saying is movie good or bad like you guys care it is worth watch though id say especially if you dont have your expectations set as high as i had,0.5083488414522895,0.020552362707535132,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.26}"

6.0,a mixed bag,"Despite its exotic setting and occasionally flashy technique, ""Guru"" is really just the oldie about the rube from the provinces who ventures to the Big Bad City in search of fame and fortune, only to fall under the spell of greed and corruption in his ruthless climb to the top. The twist here, though, is that the film is also a nationalistic David-and-Goliath tale of a man from the lower classes who takes on the entrenched corporate interests who use their collective power to keep men like him from sharing in the wealth. This leads to the rather bizarre, ethically dubious contention that it's okay to engage in corruption just as long as the people you are ripping off are demonstrably more corrupt than you are.Ambitious in theme and epic in scope, the story spans a thirty year period, beginning in 1951 when Gurubhai Desai (Abhishek Bachchan) leaves his village to make a success of himself in the outside world, and ending in 1980 when he and his company are facing prosecution for fraud, tax evasion and a whole host of other unscrupulous business practices that are threatening to bring Desai's corporate empire crashing down around him.Despite their undeniable virtues in other areas, Indian films are not generally noted for either their brevity or their emotional subtlety - and ""Guru"" is no exception in this regard. It suffers from an exhausting 155-minute running time as well as from a tendency to overstate its major plot and character points ad absurdum. When the people in the film are happy, they must be shown to be deliriously happy, dancing in the streets and throwing each other into the air to demonstrate their joy; when they are sad, angry, conniving or morally righteous, they behave in similarly emphatic and underlined ways, with A.R. Rahman's pumped-up, ear-pounding musical score wringing every remaining drop of subtlety and restraint out of the picture.Still, I suppose this is all part of the Bollywood appeal, and there are certainly some notable virtues that make the film worth recommending. First of all, the film is visually stunning, with one beautifully framed image after another unfolding in multi-colored, kaleidoscopic splendor before us. Second, there is a certain old-fashioned freshness to the utterly unabashed and shameless way in which the movie traffics in purple prose melodrama, wearing its emotions so transparently on its sleeves that it purges the story of all possible archness or coyness. (Think of it as a Douglas Sirk production with saris). Finally, as with virtually all commercial Indian films, ""Guru"" is decked out with a generous helping of lively, though admittedly quite corny, song-and-dance numbers that wind up ""stopping the show"" in both the best and worst senses of that phrase. For fun as these musical sequences are to watch, they do lead one to wonder if all the money that Indian producers so generously lavish on choreographers might not, in fact, be more wisely spent on a few judicious editors instead.",mixed bag,despite its exotic setting occasionally flashy technique guru is really just oldie about rube provinces who ventures big bad city search fame fortune only fall under spell greed corruption his ruthless climb top twist here though is that film is also nationalistic david goliath tale man lower classes who takes entrenched corporate interests who use their collective power keep men like him sharing wealth this leads rather bizarre ethically dubious contention that its okay engage corruption just as long as people you are ripping off are demonstrably more corrupt than you are ambitious theme epic scope story spans thirty year period beginning 1951 when gurubhai desai abhishek bachchan leaves his village make success himself outside world ending 1980 when he his company are facing prosecution fraud tax evasion whole host other unscrupulous business practices that are threatening bring desais corporate empire crashing down around him despite their undeniable virtues other areas indian films are not generally noted either their brevity or their emotional subtlety guru is no exception this regard it suffers exhausting 155 minute running time as well as tendency overstate its major plot character points ad absurdum when people film are happy they must be shown be deliriously happy dancing streets throwing each other into air demonstrate their joy when they are sad angry conniving or morally righteous they behave similarly emphatic underlined ways with r rahmans pumped up ear pounding musical score wringing every remaining drop subtlety restraint out picture still i suppose this is all part bollywood appeal there are certainly some notable virtues that make film worth recommending first all film is visually stunning with one beautifully framed image after another unfolding multi colored kaleidoscopic splendor before us second there is certain old fashioned freshness utterly unabashed shameless way which movie traffics purple prose melodrama wearing its emotions so transparently its sleeves that it purges story all possible archness or coyness think it as douglas sirk production with saris finally as with virtually all commercial indian films guru is decked out with generous helping lively though admittedly quite corny song dance numbers that wind up stopping show both best worst senses that phrase fun as these musical sequences are watch they do lead one wonder if all money that indian producers so generously lavish choreographers might not fact be more wisely spent few judicious editors instead,0.4869958365860006,0.06675212310458213,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"

7.0,When son becomes the father......,"This movie celebrates Abhishek Bachachan, his father's son. When you are the son of one of the best actors of the world of all times, you have the pressure to step into the shoes of your father. It doesn't happen often that a son matches up to his father in stature.In this film Abhishek Bahcachan does just that. He gives a performance his old man would've been proud of. Abhishek proves his pedigree. This is a difficult role. Not only because he has to portray a wide range in his character but also because his character has some of the cheesiest lines. But he makes you forget that the lines are out of place here and there. He goes flat out on this one, and gives a performance which is probably the best of this year. Probably matching up to Amitabh's in Black.About the film. Its a Mani Ratnam film, which raises the expectations immensely and nearly lives up to it. Its a well written story and direction is up to the mark. There is a slight problem with screenplay and the songs and dance sequences break the flow of story telling. A good film nonetheless and a great viewing.Though Abhishek steals the show; other actors are pretty good too. Mithun proves again why he is 2 times National Award winner. He is a legendary actor who has been wasting his time and talent in crappy movies for a long time now. Hope he would get better roles after this. Ash is good in the second half but her choreography is not up to the mark and she looks bland and unsophisticated while dancing. Vidya Balan is wasted and R Madhvan is good in a small role.A word about cinematography is necessary.

7.0,Context overwhelms Content,"Guru starts by dazzling with its starcast, its brilliant director-music director combo and amazing cinematography not necessarily in that order. But retrospect doesn't treat the movie that kindly. Personally,the high point of the movie was Menon's handling of the camera. Every frame of the movie is desktop-wallpaper friendly. And though that might not be good for every kind of movie, Guru with its semi-period film setting and scope of locations deserved Menon's touch.Maniratnam as usual handles his subject and his actors with consummate ease though the pace of scenes where he builds his characters too fast or truncated. A.R. Rahman is brilliant by the non-intrusiveness of his music. The Guru chant that follows Gurukant Desai around might be very Bollywoodish but hey! this IS Bollywood. Abhishek and Mithun Chakraborty deliver the best performances in the movie. If Mithun had been given any more screen space than he was, he could've easily overshadowed Abhishek. Manikdas Gupta has... well...more character than Gurukant Desai. Aishwarya as usual is a huge letdown and a liability throughout the movie but her saving grace is her reasonable performance during the Trial scene. She manages to put herself in the center of every frame and refuses to look old at 50. When will she realise that acting doesn't mean that every frame needs to look like an Aishwarya Poster or desktop wallpaper? Madhavan and Balan are obviously wasted as characters with Madhavan delivering a sterling performance but summarily dismissed during the movie. As for the message, the less said the better. There are a few jarring moments when Maniratnam goes over the top trying to project Guru who is obviously a marketplace villain as a person who deserves what he wants. Whoever from India will believe that a Taxi-Driver is so knowledgeable about personal finance that he invests enough to marry off three daughters with ""Shakti"" shares? Indians who invest in shares (especially during the time the trial is set in) can hardly be the ""Aam Aadmi"" that Guru claims to love and serve. And on the contrary, IAS/IPS officers who Guru accuses as the self-serving elite are usually the ones who're from middle-class ""Aam Aadmi"" families. On the whole an enjoyable movie especially the spine-tingling scenes where Guru triumphs. The movie is all the more enjoyable if you're familiar with the real life story( Irrespective of his claims Guru is definitely based on the tycoon).

9.0,Terrific Film from the Master himself !!,"Well, as soon as Manirathnam started to shoot for Guru, various theories started to flow among movie goers (like, it's the Ambani story kinda stuff).. And some controversies as well (like the Ambanis staking their claim to see it first)... So, this flick has aroused a lot of public interest even many months ago and with this as a background, it's been released.Before starting my comments on the movie, lemme say something. . I've seen a lotta movies in English, Tamil, Hindi etc.. Out of all those movies, there are some directors who can handle their movies with such ease that the film stands as a visual treat, not only to the eyes but for the mind also. Now, Manirathnam is the emperor of such directors, in India, according to me. I'd put both my hands up in the air and shout aloud that he's one of the greatest directors ever to have walked our country. His movies stand as the perfect examples of how well a film can be taken, in their respective subjects. He presents his movies visually, so that one can take in the scenes in to his mind, rather than to be guided by mere dialogues.Here, he combines hands with his team again (Rajiv Menon, Rahman, Gulzar, Sreekar Prasad to name a few good men...). The end result, a fantabulous experience named 'Guru'!! If I say this is the role of a life time for Abhishek, it's an understatement. He has presented such a subtle and quality acting that as soon as he gets introduced as the young Gurukant Desai, slowly he disappears and it's GuruBhai who steals the show!! Such a great acting this is and he excellently personifies the character of Guru in a terrific sense!! The way innocent Guru slowly rises in life and his gradual majestic magnanimity has been portrayed by Abhishek in a mind blasting manner.Aishwarya too has given a decent performance throughout. She supports her husband and provides him with the encouragement he needs. Mithunda has given an excellent piece of acting (the way 'excellent' has been used many more 'excellent's to follow) . Madhavan and Vidya Balan complete the wonderful acting circle of Guru.Cinematography is great, to say the least. People who know Rajiv Menon will agree wholeheartedly that this is one of his wonderful works. He shares that chemistry with Manirathnam which boosts the film up, from other normal movies. The Music!! It's done by one of the most talented geniuses, Rahman!! When he combines hands with Manirathnam, we get to hear (and see, as well) some fantastic songs and background scores, and here too it holds. I personally liked very much 'Ey Hairathen' and the way it's been filmed. The other songs also are great! It's an unmistakable truth that in Manirathnam films, he portrays romance in such a way that it stays in our heart, long after the movie's gone. In Guru also, the romantic scenes have been excellently (there goes... another excellent!!) made.As a whole, this is definitely a must watch for all and especially for Manirathnam fans, it's again a treat which has to be gobbled up again and again!!
