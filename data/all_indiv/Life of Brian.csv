10.0,One of the most intelligent comedies ever made,"Personally, I believe this to be one of the most intelligent comedies ever made. It might not appear that way at first because the film does have its share of simple slapstick and ""naughty"" moments, but generally, the topics the Pythons tackle here are very serious - albeit dealt with in a way that makes this a true contender for the funniest film of all time. A firework of hilarious sketches, timeless quotes and clever comments on the human condition, this film was deemed too dangerous for the masses and therefore, until recently, banned in several countries (normally, this only used to happen to the so called ""Video Nasties"").This film never once makes fun of Jesus (Christ) - but it DOES take the mickey out of blind, fanatic followers of any political movement or religion.An outstanding achievement and endlessly re-watchable.

10.0,Ave Monty Python!,"This is, in my opinion, the best religious movie ever made. Monty Python's Flying Circus knows how to do everything hilariously. Focusing on Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman), who gets mistaken for the messiah in Judea in 33 AD, the movie pokes fun at everything: Romans, Jews, imperialism, even extraterrestrials. With sardonic lines almost every minute, they play religious fundamentalism for what it is: silly. I don't even know which scene was my favorite; every part was so funny. You'll never forget the song at the end. This is comedy in its greatest form, and it makes sense that it would come from the guys who brought us the ""parrot sketch"".

10.0,Still one of the funniest films of all time.,"It's impossible for me to be objective about this film. I know every scene and line by heart. Not because I'm one of those ghastly Python nerds, whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did, and actually misses the joke, which is on them; they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon. No. I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often, it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity, which, as in so much Python did, is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of (i.e. surprise).Also, nostalgia value. MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes, before I even reached double figures. I gobbled up every programme, film and record in a space of a couple of short years, so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful, so I go all misty-eyed when I see it. Bizarrely, we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher, who felt it was very insightful about Roman society.But no-one watches PYTHON anymore, except that dorkish clique. My brother, only a couple of years my junior, is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then. But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself, accessible to anyone who found the very male, elitist, academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating?How can I implore you to watch this? It's got a straight narrative, with some of the greatest set-pieces and dialogue of any film ever. It's not a great FILM comedy - Terry Jones is no Gilliam - but the style suits the humour perfectly, allowing it to breathe, and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot, such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus' sermon, and squabbling about petty things like big noses, and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland, with a massive Roman statue being wheeled, and a set of crucifixes being planted: a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history.This is the film's true triumph - it's a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion. By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man, Python reclaim history from symbol and myth. It brings the body back into history. Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak, ironic conclusion (listen to 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' carefully, and in context: it's NOT comforting) - the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly.The intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing - the film is a learned commentary on power, totalitarianism, repression, language, gender, the writing of history, the politics of subversion, the complicity of the repressed. Myth is thrown to the wind - the film succeeds where Reg and his revolutionaries fail, by revealing a whole series of repressive apparatum (sic?). No-one is spared - the film is unashamedly destructive, but the film's satire is not arid or narrow; there are many rich parallels with our own time, as the extraordinary reaction from the religious on the film's release showed.But BRIAN is not just an attack on religion, but on all who would seek to write selective histories for their own interests, suppressing others' voices. The silliest jokes are also the most profound - in one scene, the kidnappers enter Pilate's palace through a tiled floor. They emerge through a modesty-concealing leaf painted on this floor. This is snickering schoolboy humour, and very very funny, but is also a comment on the phallocentricity of imperialism. Jokes like these are why BRIAN will always remain vital - it turns you into a ludicrous, ill-informed amateur historian.The acting is an astonishing feat of multiple performances, but Graham Chapman, always my favorite Python, holds the chaos together, ironically as the Kafkaesque hero who races towards the abyss, an anti-Jesus to love and identify with. If I've made the film sound like hard work, than I'm an idiot. The seriousness is only there if you want it. Like Alice in Wonderland, or Buster Keaton, PYTHON seem to be full of metaphors that encapsulate the pains of life, but are also damnably entertaining. It's strange that men as supposedly 'surreal' and 'out there' as the Pythons should speak such good sense. Only BRINGING UP BABY, THE PALM BEACH STORY, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, are funnier than this.

10.0,Utterly hilarious from start to finish!,"Life of Brian may have caused controversy on release, but this has always been my personal favourite of the Monty Python movies. Why? Because it is hilarious! True, the story isn't the best component of the film, but everything else works wonders. It is essentially an irreverent and inspired send up of religious epics, and is helped brilliantly by gags and a script that is so joyfully juvenile, if extremely rude, and quotable. Quotes such as ""He's not the Messiah. He is a very naughty boy"" and ""Welease Wodewick"" had me literally peeing my pants. The sets are realistic and all of the Pythons who here take several pot shots at their favourite targets, especially Terry Jones, Graham Chapman and Michael Palin are on top form.

10.0,A Comment on Our Gullibility,"This is such a fine movie. It involves a guy who was born just down the street in Bethlehem. The Magi go to him first and then realize they are confused and leave. He tries to lead a normal life, but word gets out that he is the Messiah. He does everything he can to get this off his back, but a group of followers begin interpreting his words as great wisdom and godliness. It gets so bad that when they are sent to check out ""the other Guy"" they ultimately find his pronouncement (actually non-pronouncements) to be much more impressive. There is a hilarious scene where he tries to make a statement about the Romans, but his Latin is so bad he is force to write it over and over on the walls, like an American schoolboy. The final scene is incredible. If you've never heard the song or seen the images, check it out. I would imaging there are some people who find this movie blasphemous. I consider it one of the greatest parodies ever produced.",comment our gullibility,this is such fine movie it involves guy who was born just down street bethlehem magi go him first then realize they are confused leave he tries lead normal life but word gets out that he is messiah he does everything he can get this off his back but group followers begin interpreting his words as great wisdom godliness it gets so bad that when they are sent check out other guy they ultimately find his pronouncement actually non pronouncements be much more impressive there is hilarious scene where he tries make statement about romans but his latin is so bad he is force write it over over walls like american schoolboy final scene is incredible if youve never heard song or seen images check it out i would imaging there are some people who find this movie blasphemous i consider it one greatest parodies ever produced,0.5786616161616162,0.14709595959595959,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,"Still funny, after 25 years","When a film is still funny 25 years after it's made, and doesn't feel particularly aged, even a quarter of a century later, then you know that you've struck gold. The famous Monty Python crew once again take a well-known subject and make a lot of fun of it. This time, the subject is religion, or, more specifically, Christianity. Everyone who knows at least a little about Christianity, which is pretty much anyone from the western world, will probably be able to laugh at something in this movie. Unless, of course, you are very Christian yourself, in that case you will probably feel that the film is blasphemous(I don't personally think so, since it makes fun of the followers and the general stupidity of people and organizations back in 30-something A.D., rather than Jesus and his teachings). The plot is about as incoherent as the usual Monty Python team film, though it should be noted that, like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it is an actual film, and not a series of sketches, like, for example, the Meaning of Life. It's about as paced as they usually are, most of the scenes contain a lot of jokes, and then they move on to the next scene, after about five minutes of jokes and sight gags. This is, unfortunately, the problem with their films; if you don't like the jokes, the film might seem extremely slow to you; of course, one could argue that Monty Python mainly make movies for the jokes sake, but they could do better on the pacing, for the sake of viewers who don't like all those repeated jokes. That's not to say that I don't like them, I laugh at them most of the time, heck, I laughed so hard that I almost got stomach ache from it at one particular instant. But, I guess that a lot of people won't like them for this way of making movies. Oh well. You can't please everyone. The humor is great, it's standard Python wacky, crazy humor, so every Python fan should enjoy it. People who don't like Monty Python should give this a chance too, if they have at least a little humor, and they aren't Christian extremists. Christian ""believers"" can probably laugh at it too, like I said, it's not the religion itself, it's more the brainwashed followers that the film makes fun of. All in all, a great film for fans of the Python crew, and people who have a sense of humor about religion(a dark sense of humor, that is). I recommend it to fans of Monty Python, people who enjoy dark humor and people who can laugh a little at the less intelligent parts of Christianity. I fall into all three categories, and I loved it. 8/10",still funny after 25 years,when film is still funny 25 years after its made doesnt feel particularly aged even quarter century later then you know that youve struck gold famous monty python crew once again take well known subject make lot fun it this time subject is religion or more specifically christianity everyone who knows at least little about christianity which is pretty much anyone western world will probably be able laugh at something this movie unless course you are very christian yourself that case you will probably feel that film is blasphemous i dont personally think so since it makes fun followers general stupidity people organizations back 30 something d rather than jesus his teachings plot is about as incoherent as usual monty python team film though it should be noted that like monty python holy grail it is actual film not series sketches like example meaning life its about as paced as they usually are most scenes contain lot jokes then they move next scene after about five minutes jokes sight gags this is unfortunately problem with their films if you dont like jokes film might seem extremely slow you course one could argue that monty python mainly make movies jokes sake but they could do better pacing sake viewers who dont like all those repeated jokes thats not say that i dont like them i laugh at them most time heck i laughed so hard that i almost got stomach ache it at one particular instant but i guess that lot people wont like them this way making movies oh well you cant please everyone humor is great its standard python wacky crazy humor so every python fan should enjoy it people who dont like monty python should give this chance too if they have at least little humor they arent christian extremists christian believers can probably laugh at it too like i said its not religion itself its more brainwashed followers that film makes fun all all great film fans python crew people who have sense humor about religion dark sense humor that is i recommend it fans monty python people who enjoy dark humor people who can laugh little at less intelligent parts christianity i fall into all three categories i loved it 8 10,0.41864406779661006,0.11829096045197736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.18}"
9.0,A Masterwork of British Comedy,"In Life of Brian, Python created what John Cleese called simply ""our masterpiece"". As a piece of writing, it is the most impressive of the three feature length Python movies. The scenes remain episodic, but there is a much more coherent narrative than in the earlier Holy Grail  I loved HG too, but for different reasons. The characters (well about one or two of the characters) have acquired some subtle shading, which is rare in comedy and, alas, rare in British comedy in particular. The plight of Chapman's Brian is one that I really cared about (although his death is also extremely funny, upbeat and one of the truly iconic moments in British cinema).The story must be fairly well known. Brian is born at the same time as Jesus with whom he leads a kind of parallel life, thus allowing the team to lampoon and satirise everything from religious zealotry and mob hysteria to 1950s biblical/sword & sandals epic cinema. It does this by marrying historic situations with more modern attitudes; thus we have revolutionary Stan who wants to be Loretta and have the right to have babies, the old man who can't understand why he's being stoned for saying simply ""that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah!"" the gruff centurion correcting Brian's Latin grammar while he's trying to daub anti-Roman slogans on a wall and the gentle centurion asking each of a line of the condemned ""crucifixion? Good"" while ticking them off on his clipboard. Interspersed with this is slapstick, pantomime women (I'm not sure there are any real women in Python, which is probably its greatest failing) and a small amount of the trademark Python surrealism (the spaceship, the ""prophet"" talking about the sons misplacing the things owned by their fathers who had placed them down only just a moment ago etc). In short, something for everyone  except, perhaps, committed Christians.A lot of attention has been paid to whether LoB is blasphemous. The Pythons claim not and I'm not sufficiently religious to care very much. On the surface, I disagree. There are also occasional sideswipes at ancient Jewish custom  although, to be fair, only stoning which, if you'll pardon the pun, might be considered a fair target. Jesus is not criticised, but the film's central message seems to be; be in the right place at the right time and even a man called Brian can become God. Almost the last line is from Eric Idle saying; ""you come from nothing and go back to nothing"" which doesn't suggest that the man on the mount at the beginning is a divinity, no matter whether he's talking sense or not.Most importantly though, LoB is refreshingly satirical. There always was an element of this in Python (mediaeval Christian philosophy lampooned in the Holy Grail for example ""this new learning amazes me Sir Bedevere, explain again how sheeps' bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes so, if she weighs the same as a duck, she must be made of wood, and therefore - a witch"". I guess LoB attracted attention because the satire had never been so bold or obvious before. This is also what makes LoB such an incredibly funny film to watch; but put it this way  despite what Rowan Atkinson may have once said  I'd be very surprised if the Python's weren't expecting the Spanish Inquisition.That shouldn't put you off, though. Unless your faith is too weak to survive Python's gentle humanism, watch this movie  you'll probably love it.",masterwork british comedy,life brian python created what john cleese called simply our masterpiece as piece writing it is most impressive three feature length python movies scenes remain episodic but there is much more coherent narrative than earlier holy grail i loved hg too but different reasons characters well about one or two characters have acquired some subtle shading which is rare comedy alas rare british comedy particular plight chapmans brian is one that i really cared about although his death is also extremely funny upbeat one truly iconic moments british cinema story must be fairly well known brian is born at same time as jesus with whom he leads kind parallel life thus allowing team lampoon satirise everything religious zealotry mob hysteria 1950s biblical sword sandals epic cinema it does this by marrying historic situations with more modern attitudes thus we have revolutionary stan who wants be loretta have right have babies old man who cant understand why hes being stoned saying simply that piece halibut was good enough jehovah gruff centurion correcting brians latin grammar while hes trying daub anti roman slogans wall gentle centurion asking each line condemned crucifixion good while ticking them off his clipboard interspersed with this is slapstick pantomime women im not sure there are any real women python which is probably its greatest failing small amount trademark python surrealism spaceship prophet talking about sons misplacing things owned by their fathers who had placed them down only just moment ago etc short something everyone except perhaps committed christians lot attention has been paid whether lob is blasphemous pythons claim not im not sufficiently religious care very much surface i disagree there are also occasional sideswipes at ancient jewish custom although be fair only stoning which if youll pardon pun might be considered fair target jesus is not criticised but films central message seems be be right place at right time even man called brian can become god almost last line is eric idle saying you come nothing go back nothing which doesnt suggest that man mount at beginning is divinity no matter whether hes talking sense or not most importantly though lob is refreshingly satirical there always was element this python mediaeval christian philosophy lampooned holy grail example this new learning amazes me sir bedevere explain again how sheeps bladders may be employed prevent earthquakes so if she weighs same as duck she must be made wood therefore witch i guess lob attracted attention because satire had never been so bold or obvious before this is also what makes lob such incredibly funny film watch but put it this way despite what rowan atkinson may have once said id be very surprised if pythons werent expecting spanish inquisition that shouldnt put you off though unless your faith is too weak survive pythons gentle humanism watch this movie youll probably love it,0.5018631210059782,0.18670882292310864,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,"Not necessarily laugh-out-loud every minute, but it's satirical edge and wit is as clever as the technical side of the film","Monty Python's follow-up to their cult smash Holy Grail was Life of Brian, a film that takes on (if not always with the utmost seriousness, then usually with a mix of silliness and slight intellectualism) the believers in religions, the zealous nature that belief brings out in people. I first saw the film in the theater upon its re-release last month, and I found it very funny, though not with the kind of belly laughs that I had on my first reaction to Holy Grail. It's not without it's scenes that stick out as some of Python's finest (the Stoning, Pilate's scenes, the Spaceship sequence), even as sometimes it goes a little too broad for comfort (part of the colisseum).Yet, the great strengths that lie in Life of Brian are that 1) the writers and performers (Chapman, Cleese, Gilliam, Jones, Idle, Palin) bring their irreverent strengths to a fine point with the script and multiple roles. Even when a scene doesn't get the laughs it could've or should've, it turns out to be a scene brimming with a cleverness that could only exist in the ""Python-esque"" universe. 2) the director (Jones) and designer/animator (Gilliam) lay the groundwork for this realistic atmosphere of 33 A.D. and bring out what is the best in the acting, Pythons or otherwise (famous British comedian Spike Milligan has a role of note). Held over from the sets of Franco Zeferelli's Christ film, the Pythons use all these locations and settings and little details to spring out their wild, brilliant gags. The look of the film enriches the comedic elements, and the result is (arguably, of course) the troupe's best film. Not for all tastes by the way (Monty Python in general for me took some while to warm up to, but paid off once it worked).

8.0,"I Think God Has A Sense Of Humor, Don't You?","And in the 1979th year of Our Lord, God took in a screening of Monty Python's ""Life Of Brian,"" and thought it was funny. He did NOT think the film was blasphemous or offensive in any way. Yea, God did admire it's incredibly clever pokes at religion and at religious fanatics, for God Himself knew the virtue of being able to laugh at one's self. He also knew before He even walked into the theater that the title character, Brian, was NOT Jesus Christ, but merely a man who was born at the same time as Christ---right next door, in fact---and became mistaken for a messiah. God settled into His seat, with popcorn in one hand and diet soda in another, and had a rollicking good time.He recommended ""Life Of Brian"" to His Son, Jesus, who went to see it the following week. He, too, thought it was a hilarious film, and immediately sang the praises of the Monty Python troupe---John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam & Michael Palin---for creating such a wonderful spoof. And He recommended the film to His friends. Have an open mind, He told them, and have fun. But God and His Son were quite puzzled why so many people in the Bible Belt community were so upset by ""Life Of Brian""---especially the ones who hadn't even bothered to SEE the frigging film for fear of being damned for all time. And They both shook their heads in dismay. It's only a movie, They thought, and a very funny, harmless one at that.

9.0,Brian the mistaken Messiah,"Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman) was born next to baby Jesus being mistaken for the Messiah by the three wise men. He has a loud Jewish mother (Terry Jones). He spends his life around the biblical events eventually joining a Jewish resistance group. On the run from the Romans, he is mistaken for the Messiah by a crowd leading to his crucification.There are three things I love about this movie. The first is the hilarious Jewish mother by Terry Jones. Every time he says something, I have to laugh. The first half of the movie is a bit hit and miss. There are some really funny skits. Around midway, Brian is mistaken for the Messiah and I think this is where the best comedy is. It's a light hearted skewering of church doctrine. They are literally killing it with kindness as the fanatical followers declare everything divine. Of course, I love the finale song.

8.0,He's not the Messiah; he's a very naughty boy!,"Brian is an ordinary Judean who just happened to be born at the same time as Christ (leading to some confusion among the wise men). He grows up with a dislike of the Roman occupiers and falls in with a terrorist group known as the Judean People's Front. It isn't long before this gets him into trouble with the Romans and they plan to crucify him. He manages to escape, with the help of a passing spaceship, but soon has other problems. After posing as a street side preacher he picks up a group of followers who believe that he is the Messiah!These days it is hard to see why this film was considered controversial; it is clear from the opening scene that Brian is not Jesus under another name. It is however very funny; a series of hilarious and eminently quotable scenes that combine to make a great film. The Monty Python team are on top form, each of them playing a number of roles. Graham Chapman stands out as he plays the eponymous Brian; an ordinary man caught up in extraordinary events. The jokes are all pretty funny but if one doesn't particularly amuse you another will be along shortly. The film feels fresh and relevant today; in fact some of the satire could have easily have been written in the present day as we see rebel groups who hate each other more than their official enemy and people are executed for supposed blasphemy where the accusers won't repeat what was allegedly said as they would be considered blasphemous too.

Personally, it's somewhat difficult for em to come up with which of their films is the finest and funniest-but I think it just might be ""Life of Brian"".While the group has always had a satirical edge, ""Life of Brian"" is easily their most satirical work, as it mocks countless things in an extremely creative and entertaining fashion.

,A classic comedy that is rightly held up as the best of the Python films,"Born in a stable, the infant Brian is mistaken for someone else until the wise men twig that they are in the wrong stable. Brian's life continues to be unremarkable until he is about 30 when he gets mixed up with the People's Front of Judea in their fight against the Romans (although he is only there to try and get in Judith). Unsurprisingly the actions of the PFJ don't exactly particularly succeed and Brian finds himself on the run from the Romans as a result. However while hiding out in speakers' corner he is first taken for a wise teacher but then for some sort of messiah  a mistaken identity that escalates out of control very quickly.Watching the film now it is not really worth discussing whether this is mocking Jesus or not because the accepted wisdom is now that it is not an attack on Jesus but rather a lampoon on religion itself (although their original idea was to make ""Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory""). However if it doesn't seem so controversial nowadays just imagine an Islamic remake and how that would be received. Anyway back to the film in hand rather than the reaction of people who have not seen it complaining about their perception of it. At its heart this is a Monty Python film and the sense of humour is very British and very much them. I say this rather obvious statement because despite the fuss the most memorable thing about the film is how funny it is. It will always be remembered for the controversy but when you watch it it is basically a collection of sketches and comedy characters rolling one after the other with many of them well-known and full of memorable and funny dialogue.That it isn't just a collection of sketches held together (like some of their other films) is down to how good the story is. Of course they did have a bit of help with this in regards material to adapt but still it does feel much more satisfying to have this solid narrative underneath all the madness. Over time some people have come to seen this film as an entire attack on religion but it isn't because the laughs were the focus. However scattered across the whole film are scenes that do effectively lampoon the concept of religious beliefs and religious establishments. Most of these are very clever and, in particular, one scene sums up the history of religious splits and factions (the shoe and the gourd) and is impressive in its superficial simplicity.It goes without saying that the cast are all on fine form. Although he wanted to play Brian, Cleese is much, much more effective in the many small roles he has and is best when he has petty authority figures to deliver. Of course similar things could said of all of the cast as Idle, Jones, Palin and Gilliam are all very good in their characters and are mostly all playing to their strengths. In the ""title"" role Chapman actually has the least rewarding role as he has to play it (comparatively) straight in order to keep the narrative together. He does it very well but the rest of the Pythons are much better simply because they have sketches to delivery rather than a narrative to drive.Overall then this is a classic comedy that is rightly held up as the best of the Python films. Scene by scene it is a great collection of absurd sketches but the narrative is pretty much strong enough to prevent it just being this. Although the laughs are the all, the film has plenty of clever lampoons on the development of religions and religious organisations. It is a shame that it is so well known for the controversy because this has so much more that makes it memorable.",classic comedy that is rightly held up as best python films,born stable infant brian is mistaken someone else until wise men twig that they are wrong stable brians life continues be unremarkable until he is about 30 when he gets mixed up with peoples front judea their fight against romans although he is only there try get judith unsurprisingly actions pfj dont exactly particularly succeed brian finds himself run romans as result however while hiding out speakers corner he is first taken wise teacher but then some sort messiah mistaken identity that escalates out control very quickly watching film now it is not really worth discussing whether this is mocking jesus or not because accepted wisdom is now that it is not attack jesus but rather lampoon religion itself although their original idea was make jesus christ lust glory however if it doesnt seem so controversial nowadays just imagine islamic remake how that would be received anyway back film hand rather than reaction people who have not seen it complaining about their perception it at its heart this is monty python film sense humour is very british very much them i say this rather obvious statement because despite fuss most memorable thing about film is how funny it is it will always be remembered controversy but when you watch it it is basically collection sketches comedy characters rolling one after other with many them well known full memorable funny dialogue that it isnt just collection sketches held together like some their other films is down how good story is course they did have bit help with this regards material adapt but still it does feel much more satisfying have this solid narrative underneath all madness over time some people have come seen this film as entire attack religion but it isnt because laughs were focus however scattered across whole film are scenes that do effectively lampoon concept religious beliefs religious establishments most these are very clever particular one scene sums up history religious splits factions shoe gourd is impressive its superficial simplicity it goes without saying that cast are all fine form although he wanted play brian cleese is much much more effective many small roles he has is best when he has petty authority figures deliver course similar things could said all cast as idle jones palin gilliam are all very good their characters are mostly all playing their strengths title role chapman actually has least rewarding role as he has play it comparatively straight order keep narrative together he does it very well but rest pythons are much better simply because they have sketches delivery rather than narrative drive overall then this is classic comedy that is rightly held up as best python films scene by scene it is great collection absurd sketches but narrative is pretty much strong enough prevent it just being this although laughs are all film has plenty clever lampoons development religions religious organisations it is shame that it is so well known controversy because this has so much more that makes it memorable,0.5398938072881736,0.2809043147775542,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,I'm A Christian And This Is My Favorite Comedy Of All Time.,"Monty Python's The Life of Brian is notorious for offending many Christians- especially at the time of it's release 43 years ago- despite many of these protesters being non-viewers. However, I'm a Christian and this is my favorite comedy movie. (Admittedly, my love for Bible-themed movies plays a factor in that.)The plot follows Brian, a man who was born next to Jesus on the same night. As Brian gets older, HE is mistaken for The Messiah, which results in unwanted followers and accidental crucifixion.While the film is clearly a satire on the Christian faith, and religion in general, there is actually less to be offended by then one might think. For one thing, this movie is not necessarily an attack on Jesus or His message. In fact, this movie is not really about Christ Himself.He only appears twice in the film, once at the Nativity (the wisemen mistake Brian for Jesus and almost give him their gifts), and later in The Sermon on the Mount, where people far from Him mishear what He is teaching:""Blessed are the cheesemakers? What's so special about the cheesemakers?""""Well, obviously it's not meant to be taken literally, it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.""The movie's intention is not necessarily to attack faith or make religious people change their mind, the message is to avoid BLIND faith. This is shown in a couple of well done scenes.First, there is a scene where Brian, at his house, tells his followers that they are individuals. The crowd ironically agrees and says: ""Yes, we are all individuals!"" ""You have to think for yourselves!"" ""Yes, we have to think for ourselves!""In another scene, Brian can't convince his followers that he isn't The Messiah, so he gives up and says that he is, to which they all excitedly bow to him. Brian then shouts: ""Now, F off!"" to which one person replies: ""How should we F off, oh lord?""These scenes, while silly, do a great job of showing the movie's aforementioned message. While the Python crew are atheists, they don't seem to be making a movie saying: ""Be an atheist, religion is blind."" It's really saying: ""Don't just believe because the crowd does."" If you think through your faith and still believe, that's great, but make sure your personal faith truly is your own.Apart from the message, the movie is of course very funny, and has many moments that have me laughing quite loud. Some jokes are quite offensive, but work within the context.For example, early in the movie, Brian badmouths a Roman, and his mother sets him aside and admits that he is half-Roman. ""Do you mean you were raped?"" He asks, shocked. His mother then responds: ""Well, at first yes.""It's the most messed up joke I've ever heard in a movie, but The Python crew manages to make it work within it's context- though of course no movie would have that kind of humor now.The movie's opening credits also have a song that parodies the opening of a James Bond film, singing about how Brian grew up into a man. This includes this hilarious line:""And his voice dropped down low, and things started to grow, on young Brian and show, he was certainly no...no girl named Brian! Not a girl named Brian!""Speaking of songs, the movie concludes with perhaps the most famous song in Monty Python, Always Look On The Bright Side of Life. I just watched the movie for the 3rd time, and I played that song twice- it's that catchy. And it makes for one of the best endings in cinema history.It's really hard to discuss why Life of Brian is such a great movie without getting into these spoilers. There are many funny and thought-provoking moments- this review barely scratches the surface. Hopefully, however, I have exemplified why this is the best comedy movie I have ever seen. It's one of the silliest yet provocative movies ever produced.While some may find this film offensive (though this movie is targeting you if that's the case), Life of Brian makes for a great comedy with great laughs, a great story, and an interesting message on top of that. And that's more than enough to call this the best comedy movie I have ever seen.",im christian this is my favorite comedy all time,monty pythons life brian is notorious offending many christians especially at time its release 43 years ago despite many these protesters being non viewers however im christian this is my favorite comedy movie admittedly my love bible themed movies plays factor that plot follows brian man who was born next jesus same night as brian gets older he is mistaken messiah which results unwanted followers accidental crucifixion while film is clearly satire christian faith religion general there is actually less be offended by then one might think one thing this movie is not necessarily attack jesus or his message fact this movie is not really about christ himself he only appears twice film once at nativity wisemen mistake brian jesus almost give him their gifts later sermon mount where people far him mishear what he is teaching blessed are cheesemakers whats so special about cheesemakers well obviously its not meant be taken literally it refers any manufacturers dairy products movies intention is not necessarily attack faith or make religious people change their mind message is avoid blind faith this is shown couple well done scenes first there is scene where brian at his house tells his followers that they are individuals crowd ironically agrees says yes we are all individuals you have think yourselves yes we have think ourselves another scene brian cant convince his followers that he isnt messiah so he gives up says that he is which they all excitedly bow him brian then shouts now f off which one person replies how should we f off oh lord these scenes while silly do great job showing movies aforementioned message while python crew are atheists they dont seem be making movie saying be atheist religion is blind its really saying dont just believe because crowd does if you think through your faith still believe thats great but make sure your personal faith truly is your own apart message movie is course very funny has many moments that have me laughing quite loud some jokes are quite offensive but work within context example early movie brian badmouths roman his mother sets him aside admits that he is half roman do you mean you were raped he asks shocked his mother then responds well at first yes its most messed up joke ive ever heard movie but python crew manages make it work within its context though course no movie would have that kind humor now movies opening credits also have song that parodies opening james bond film singing about how brian grew up into man this includes this hilarious line his voice dropped down low things started grow young brian show he was certainly no no girl named brian not girl named brian speaking songs movie concludes with perhaps most famous song monty python always look bright side life i just watched movie 3rd time i played that song twice its that catchy it makes one best endings cinema history its really hard discuss why life brian is such great movie without getting into these spoilers there are many funny thought provoking moments this review barely scratches surface hopefully however i have exemplified why this is best comedy movie i have ever seen its one silliest yet provocative movies ever produced while some may find this film offensive though this movie is targeting you if thats case life brian makes great comedy with great laughs great story interesting message top that thats more than enough call this best comedy movie i have ever seen,0.533330577601411,0.2256751543209877,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,A Massive Achievement in Satire,"Because it so loudly cuts against the trappings of today's ""cancel culture,"" 1979's ""Monty Python's Life of Brian"" arguably now stands as the comedy troupe's most distinguished masterpiece. Filmed in Tunisia while repurposing sets from ""Jesus of Nazareth (1977),"" this film is perched among the top branches of our very greatest satires. There's no doubt its brilliant fingerprints are all over more modern day parodies and spoofs, from the culturally eviscerating ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999),"" to fellow religious farce ""Sausage Party (2016),"" to recent and raunch-heavy music industry satire ""Stadium Anthems (2018).""And the film almost didn't happen. Beatle George Harrison had to dole out millions to save it after the studio pulled out over fears of backlash. Good on ya, George, because what resulted is nothing short of a landmark achievement in comedy. While ""Life of Brian"" has all the elite DNA of typical Python, it elevates beyond its siblings with an ending for the ages, as the crucifixion itself is repurposed as musical comedy of gleefully poor taste. A choir of convicts nailed into wooden slabs breaks out in song with ""Always Look On The Bright Side of Life,"" cementing the scene as a culturally understood reference point throughout Britain, and in much the same way that ""this goes to eleven"" from ""This Is Spinal Tap (1984)"" is established nomenclature in the States.Sadly, this movie couldn't be made today, as the use of superficially insensitive comedic material to lambaste ignorance has somehow become verboten. What a shame, that. Fortunately, ""Monty Python's Life of Brian"" wasn't a stage production, and instead remains immortalized on film for the weathering of all shifts in the cultural winds. - (Was this review of use to you?

9.0,One of the most wickedly funny moves ever made.,"It's been called blasphemous, a travesty, an attack on Jesus Christ and one of the funniest movies ever made. When nobody else wanted to touch it, George Harrison of the Beatles agreed to finance it simply because after reading the script he wanted to see the movie. What we got was a parody of sorts of a man, born about the same time as Jesus Christ, who also amasses a following and winds up crucified at the end. The difference is of course nobody remembers Brian of Nazareth but now his story can be told.The movie is full of hilarious characters, misunderstood comments and the very surreal and zany humor that the Pythons were known for. I will say that this isn't a movie for everybody. I know of several deeply religious people who get offended by this movie and that's their opinion. But if that isn't you and Monty Python is your kind of thing then you really ought to see this. There's really no reason to miss it.",one most wickedly funny moves ever made,its been called blasphemous travesty attack jesus christ one funniest movies ever made when nobody else wanted touch it george harrison beatles agreed finance it simply because after reading script he wanted see movie what we got was parody sorts man born about same time as jesus christ who also amasses following winds up crucified at end difference is course nobody remembers brian nazareth but now his story can be told movie is full hilarious characters misunderstood comments very surreal zany humor that pythons were known i will say that this isnt movie everybody i know several deeply religious people who get offended by this movie thats their opinion but if that isnt you monty python is your kind thing then you really ought see this theres really no reason miss it,0.4755494505494506,0.20192307692307693,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.42, 'Fear': 0.05}"
7.0,Cheerful Nihilism.,"There's a scene in this send up of Biblical movies and stories that always gets a chuckle out of me. At the end, there are a dozen or so men strung up there and left to die on crosses. Brian, the protagonist, is one of them. He's done nothing to deserve it. His friends and rescuers have failed him. But his crucified neighbor sums up the most apt attitude by cheerfully advising Brian not to be so glum about it all. He begins to sing and whistle a song, ""Always Look On The Bright Side of Life,"" that contains incongruous lyrics that are too vulgar to reproduce here. Not only, ""Always look on the bright side of Death/ Just before you draw your terminal breath,"" but ""Life's a piece of s***/ When you look at it...."" Monty Python seem to me to have been entirely serious, amid the gaggle of gags, in skewering all of our intense dispositions to follow one or another social or religious movement. As far as I know they were only explicit about it in the penultimate scene of ""The Meaning of Life,"" which wound up with an actor in drag advising us to try to be nice to one another. I think it was meant seriously.But then there is often a momentous covert message behind some of the jokes. I'll give one example.Brian, having been mistaken for a prophet in the Holy Land, runs down the streets followed by a gang of ardent worshippers and he accidentally loses his shoe and leaves it behind rather than be caught. The followers stop and gape at the shoe. One holds the shoe in the air and cries that Brian wants all of us to wear only one shoe. Another argues that it's not the shoe that's the sign, it's Brian's gourd that he left behind. An dispute ensues over whether it should be the shoe or the gourd. A joke, because the conflict lacks instrumental meaning -- except when you think of Sunni vs. Shi'ite in the Middle East, or Catholic vs. Protestant in Northern Ireland.Some of the jokes are sillier than others, recalling Mel Brooks. Pilate has speech defect. His ""r"" comes out as ""w"", and the crowd keeps tricking him into calling out names with lots of ""r""s in them, which convulses them with laughter. ""Woger the Wobber!"" he cries, and the crowd hoots and doubles over. His friend, Biggus Dickus, speaks with a lisp and is drawn into lengthy pronouncements containing ""s"". Well, I DID mention Mel Brooks.It helps, though, if you're in the right mood for this nihilistic nonsense. Anything can happen. Anything goes. A man may jump from a tower and land in a space ship that happens to be speeding by. When the Roman guards find a rebel painting ""Romans Go Home"" (in Latin) on a wall, they don't arrest him. They correct his grammar and make him copy it one hundred times on the wall. (The Centurion, John Cleese, had attended prep school and Cambridge and had taught Latin.) I don't know how well that will go over with kids who never heard of using correct grammar, let alone in Latin, a notoriously synthetic language in which each word contains many morphemes. I swear there must be an agglutinative language somewhere in which you can say something like, ""I'd rather watch television tonight than hang out at the Sonicburger"" -- and it all comes out as one word.Anyway, if you're in a mood to have your head taken and shaken back and forth a little, ""The Life of Brian"" might get the job done.",cheerful nihilism,theres scene this send up biblical movies stories that always gets chuckle out me at end there are dozen or so men strung up there left die crosses brian protagonist is one them hes done nothing deserve it his friends rescuers have failed him but his crucified neighbor sums up most apt attitude by cheerfully advising brian not be so glum about it all he begins sing whistle song always look bright side life that contains incongruous lyrics that are too vulgar reproduce here not only always look bright side death just before you draw your terminal breath but lifes piece s when you look at it monty python seem me have been entirely serious amid gaggle gags skewering all our intense dispositions follow one or another social or religious movement as far as i know they were only explicit about it penultimate scene meaning life which wound up with actor drag advising us try be nice one another i think it was meant seriously but then there is often momentous covert message behind some jokes ill give one example brian having been mistaken prophet holy land runs down streets followed by gang ardent worshippers he accidentally loses his shoe leaves it behind rather than be caught followers stop gape at shoe one holds shoe air cries that brian wants all us wear only one shoe another argues that its not shoe thats sign its brians gourd that he left behind dispute ensues over whether it should be shoe or gourd joke because conflict lacks instrumental meaning except when you think sunni vs shiite middle east or catholic vs protestant northern ireland some jokes are sillier than others recalling mel brooks pilate has speech defect his r comes out as w crowd keeps tricking him into calling out names with lots r s them which convulses them with laughter woger wobber he cries crowd hoots doubles over his friend biggus dickus speaks with lisp is drawn into lengthy pronouncements containing s well i did mention mel brooks it helps though if youre right mood this nihilistic nonsense anything can happen anything goes man may jump tower land space ship that happens be speeding by when roman guards find rebel painting romans go home latin wall they dont arrest him they correct his grammar make him copy it one hundred times wall centurion john cleese had attended prep school cambridge had taught latin i dont know how well that will go over with kids who never heard using correct grammar let alone latin notoriously synthetic language which each word contains many morphemes i swear there must be agglutinative language somewhere which you can say something like id rather watch television tonight than hang out at sonicburger it all comes out as one word anyway if youre mood have your head taken shaken back forth little life brian might get job done,0.5470124716553287,0.024552154195011333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.39}"
