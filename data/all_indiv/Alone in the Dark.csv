2.0,Well . . . it's not predictable,"I usually start by relaying the premise of the film, but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review, let me preface it by saying that I'm someone who likes most films (just check my other reviews). Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll, whose film right before this one was House of the Dead (2003). Like Alone in the Dark, it was also a film adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated it. Well, I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10! My point in stating this (which will surely turn some readers off immediately) is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark, there must be something wrong with it.The Premise: Who am I kidding? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States' budget, but here it goes anyway. Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the ""second world"", which was evil in nature. The bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. Later, some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal, and specifically this tribe, decided to experiment on some kids, to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. (Believe it or not--everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film--it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us). Then, there was something about the kids being in an orphanage, but the government takes them back out, and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics, and there are super humans roaming around, and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.In fact, the exposition never really stops. It's like a neverending backstory from hell. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25. But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans, we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf, worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens, tunneling worms underground, zombies, Starship Trooper-like wars, evil scientists, underground lairs, gold mines, spooky warehouses, impalements, big mostly unused museums, government conspiracies, golden trunks pulled out of the sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing plots, a very ambiguous romance, car chases, home invasions, kitchen sinks . . . wait, I can't remember if that last one was in the film. Even more amazingly (amusingly?), in Fangoria #240, producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying, ""We're spending much more time on story, being very meticulous about that"". Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark ""a smarter film"".Let me not mislead anyone. A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film, but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else. I usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting, why we were there, or what anyone was doing (at least when each scene began). It's just a random mishmash of settings and clichés, as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers. Then when he was done, he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice, then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching. Sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel (which is a combination of short, varied, unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work), but perhaps that's being too generous. I'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel. Just as I tend to at least like most films, I tend to like most actors and most performances. It's very rare that I say that a performance was bad. Well, Tara Reid was bad here--and I'm someone who usually likes Reid. I don't know what happened. For a large percentage of the film, they just move her around the set like a prop. They might as well have just bought a blow-up doll. That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws.And speaking of that dialogue, a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla. By that, I mean that it's a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook. At least in Godzilla films, there's a campiness to it, because they know how ridiculous it is, and there's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here, besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents, is difficult to say. I can't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance, although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar. I think that's unprecedented for me.Still, I didn't give this film a 1. There was some competent cinematography, even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it, and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good. Heck, even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad. I actually thought the film had promise at that point. But this may just be the worst film I've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more.",well its not predictable,i usually start by relaying premise film but before anyone makes any hasty judgments

2.0,shockingly bad,"I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking ""Where is this happening? What's going on?"" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though.",shockingly bad,i was honestly surprised by alone dark it was so bad i could hardly believe what i was seeing there are no characters just few stereotypes wandering around getting killed extent character development was giving each character name occupation thats about it there was no real plot none characters seemed have any motivation fact many action scenes just began their own coming nowhere with pounding techno track while i was watching this movie i kept asking where is this happening whats going acting was high school drama quality with stiff wooden delivery as though actors were reading cue cards without comprehending their lines their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design adr sounded like it was recorded open room actors were constantly taking obvious care hit their marks looking almost robotic their movements so these listless automatons are whisked through series implausible confusing scenarios often without even benefit transition scenes they were here now theyre there this was happening now thats happening random scenes with little rhyme or reason i had lot fun watching it definitely not worth nine bucks though,0.4154597701149425,-0.0804638752052545,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.47}"
2.0,Oddly prophetic for Reid's career,"This film looks and feels like Sharknado. The effects are poor, some of the line readings are unintentionally funny, and the action sequences are cut to pieces to hide the frequent switching of actor and stunt double. In some ways it's a shame that this wasn't made by The Asylum. There was a golden opportunity to make a series of increasingly stupid films based off of rip-off xenomorphs climbing out of the shadow realm! Still, if they had done this we probably wouldn't have Stranger Things, and Reid got to take part in the Sharknado series eight years later anyway, so maybe it's for the best this never went any further!",oddly prophetic reids career,this film looks feels like sharknado effects are poor some line readings are unintentionally funny action sequences are cut pieces hide frequent switching actor stunt double some ways its shame that this wasnt made by asylum there was golden opportunity make series increasingly stupid films based off rip off xenomorphs climbing out shadow realm still if they had done this we probably wouldnt have stranger things reid got take part sharknado series eight years later anyway so maybe its best this never went any further,0.41363636363636364,0.03484848484848486,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,"A better title would have been, ""Alone int the Theatre""","Obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you'll only hold it against them. Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones. The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store. If there's any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you.",better title would have been alone int theatre,obviously lot talented behind scenes crew members worked this movie so dont even look at credits at end youll only hold it against them nobody seemed interested seeing this movie only 3 were theater two passed out after 10 minutes they were lucky ones monsters were unemployed worm star trek 2 wrath khan rejected designs space creatures alien creators movie obviously didnt want overshadow third rate movie monsters so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didnt get memorize their lines or some cases learn pronounce words before filming began some scenes are incredibly inept conveying just what is supposed be happening if anything is if you are unfortunate enough be theater where this movie is showing you dont pass out youll laugh at what are supposed be frightening or suspenseful moments film implausibility several scenes will just stun you stephen dorffs regular spewing queen mary curse words conveys feeling anyone who pays see this if you must see this movie do yourself favor wait until its bargain bin at video store if theres any justice film industry one main actors will be there rent it you,0.5925518925518924,0.0738095238095238,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.5}"
1.0,Spectacular Crap-fest,"I don't know where to begin. Tara Reid needs to be stopped before she's put in another movie. Stephen Dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from Val Kilmer in ""Top Gun"". Slater sleepwalks through this dreck. The direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy-metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on them), and hey, there's no discernible plot either.

1.0,"I went on a quest for the worst movie ever made that had a high budget, and It has been discovered.","True, there are many movies much worse then this movie. This movie was no Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I have seen them both.. twice) but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (Yes, even that movie surpassed this). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad. Razzie awards lookout, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark. I'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.Acting- I'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film (next to the ending credits, which played 'Wish I had An Angel', the acting. Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze. Though all his awful dialog he had to speak, it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway. Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well (somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it). Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these. That is not to say the acting was perfect though, it was average, not good, and perhaps the only thing in the film not good.The Soundtrack- Except for 'Wish I had An Angel', the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears, perhaps to disguise the awful story (something I will get to soon). A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.The Directing- Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us ""Yes, movies can get this utterly bad and that's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies"". At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall. On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action, the camera stops for some reason.The Producing- Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I pity the fool... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.The Writing / Storyboard- Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted (this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud). Then it fast-forwards many years later where he's a paranoia detective. He get's attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death, kills it and moves on with life. Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.Yeah, the plot is bad, really really bad. The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes, which felt like 100, of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani. The film goes not to have one twist after another, more then the audience can handle, more then the audience wants to handle, more then the audience could ever care about. This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.Overall, miss out on this movie.

1.0,An Abomination,"The definition of an abomination as defined by Webster's Dictioary is ""a cause of abhorrence or disgust."" If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark, please let me know because this is the best I can come up with. However, I do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is.I went to see this film with two of my roommates. One has very similar tastes to me, the other is an action/adventure flick guru. This latter guy usually doesn't care about the size of the plot holes, as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied.That being said we entered the theater for the Friday viewing of Alone in the Dark. Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater. When it started I knew why immediately.It begins with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately I have to admit it only gets worse from there. The opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated. Yet, I understand why it was narrated. The director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of PAYING to see this movie. Yet, not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense. It seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies. One is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal, the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans. If you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone.Then the awful storyline, acting, effects, and camera work begin. Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress. She does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator. Slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reid.The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man. The entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like: What is this? And what is going on? Other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by Slater himself. Are they good? NO. Do they explain anything? NO. Do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens? Once again, NO.Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another. But then BAM...sex scene. Once again I don't know.A good, oh i don't know, 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things. This is set to a heavy-metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible.And if that wasn't enough...There exists no main villain. There is the scientist and there are the ""alien"" things. At one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again I have no idea.The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did the alien things break through? Did the military tell them? Who knows...and by this point who cares? I didn't and you won't.But to top it off, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight.

2.0,"Remember, Uwe, I enjoyed Rampage","I'm in no hurry to get in the boxing ring with director Uwe Boll, a man who has been known to use his pugilistic skills to silence his less favourable critics, but I have got to say that this horror/action film (apparently based on an Atari video game) is utterly diabolical—far worse than I ever expected (my opinion of Boll had been reasonably high after seeing Rampage, which was surprisingly effective).The long-winded opening narration is the first clue that this is going to stink: ancient civilisations, evil creatures from another world, a secret organisation devoted to investigation of the paranormal, and a mad scientist experimenting on orphaned children are clumsily thrown together in an attempt to establish the background to the film, but they only succeed in confusing the viewer before things have even begun. Matters are made even more incomprehensible with a prologue that occurs '22 years ago' but which segues into the present day and proceeds to introduce even more mind-bogglingly random elements to ensure that even the most astute of viewers will be completely baffled.As the film progresses, more and more nonsensical garbage is haphazardly thrown into the mix, Boll's pointless directorial stylisms making everything impossible to follow, with the occasional voice-over by Christian Slater (intended to help explain matters) only adding to the embarrassment factor. Ridiculous voice-overs aside, Slater's performance isn't all that bad, but his co-star Tara Reid is absolutely terrible and was clearly hired for her looks (yet she doesn't even have the decency to take off her bra during the obligatory sex scene!).After much frenetic shooting, a smattering of reasonably fun gore, some choice snippets of lousy dialogue ('Some doors are meant to stay shut') and lots of naff CGI creature attacks, during which Boll throws in some lousy Indiana Jones-style adventure and a scene completely ripped off from James Cameron's Aliens (the Xenos—yes the monsters ARE called that—obliterate a team of soldiers, despite the use of automated sentry guns), the film wraps up leaving the viewer none the wiser about what they have witnessed.",remember uwe i enjoyed rampage,im no hurry get boxing ring with director uwe boll man who has been known use his pugilistic skills silence his less favourable critics but i have got say that this horror action film apparently based atari video game is utterly diabolical far worse than i ever expected my opinion boll had been reasonably high after seeing rampage which was surprisingly effective long winded opening narration is first clue that this is going stink ancient civilisations evil creatures another world secret organisation devoted investigation paranormal mad scientist experimenting orphaned children are clumsily thrown together attempt establish background film but they only succeed confusing viewer before things have even begun matters are made even more incomprehensible with prologue that occurs 22 years ago but which segues into present day proceeds introduce even more mind bogglingly random elements ensure that even most astute viewers will be completely baffled as film progresses more more nonsensical garbage is haphazardly thrown into mix bolls pointless directorial stylisms making everything impossible follow with occasional voice over by christian slater intended help explain matters only adding embarrassment factor ridiculous voice overs aside slaters performance isnt all that bad but his co star tara reid is absolutely terrible was clearly hired her looks yet she doesnt even have decency take off her bra during obligatory sex scene after much frenetic shooting smattering reasonably fun gore some choice snippets lousy dialogue some doors are meant stay shut lots naff cgi creature attacks during which boll throws some lousy indiana jones style adventure scene completely ripped off james camerons aliens xenos yes monsters are called that obliterate team soldiers despite use automated sentry guns film wraps up leaving viewer none wiser about what they have witnessed,0.5526744186046512,-0.0739922480620155,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"
1.0,How NOT to direct a film.,"Can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After helming the appalling 'House of the Dead' director Uwe Boll has now cast his less-than-talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. Don't these guys get it? To anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! The acting here is, at best, sub-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which did have its scary moments) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored. Why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets.

4.0,"SciFi-Monster movie displaying unstopped action, thrills ride , violence and a lot of FX and computer generator creatures","Based on the Atari video game , the film starts with a lengthy opening text . In fact this long prologue was added after several test audience members said they were confused by the screenplay . In 1967 mine workers discovered the first remnants of a long lost native American civilization , the Abkani . They believed there are two worlds on this planet . A world of light and a world of darkness .10.000 years ago , they opened a gate between these worlds . Before they could close it , something evil slipped through . They mysteriously vanished from the earth . Only a few artifacts remained hidden in the world's most remote place . These artifacts speak of terrifying creatures that thrive in the darkness , waiting for the day that the gate can be opened again .Later on , things go wrong when a saboteur breaks a gate and releases the monsters . They go throughout the gate and hell breaks loose . As some scientists , detectives (as Edward Carnby : Christian Slater ) , the beautiful anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) , and agents of the Bureau 713 (led by Cmdr. Richard Burke : Stephen Dorff) of the paranormal slowly unravel mysterious as well as suspenseful happenings with deadly and unexpected results . As a small team of agents to penetrate at an Alien-style complex .Evil awakens. Can mankind defeat the army of darkness unleashed by an ancient evil cult?¨Alien¨ and ¨Resident Evil¨ Sagas are two good terror/action movies with a lot of attributes which this film version regrettably fails to emulate . Players of Atari's original role-playing adventure/terror game will know how terrifying it was . The main issue deals with creepy monsters made in 3D computer generator in which they are freed when a mysterious man makes the mistake of opening up a secret door between two worlds and letting them mayhem shuffle forth . The strange creatures , Alien-alike , take another pasting in the shoot'em up/monster movie rendition based on the famous video game from Atari . As our protagonists battle their way through the carnage before the final confrontation takes place . Breathtaking images , crossfire , spectacular battles and duels and lots of amusement and entertainment ; but being really mediocre , and sometimes embarrassing . And is added a brief love scene between Christian Slater and Tara Reid featuring a wonderful song in background . The efficient set up is not enough for delivering a nice movie , and the picture falls in ordinay topics , cliches and a salad of eerie monsters including various scenes with no much sense .It packs an atmospheric but dark cinematography from Mathias Neumann . It contains a thrilling score , and the song that can be heard during the shooting sequence is ""Ghost"" by Mnemic and another famous song sung by Neneh Cherry and Youssou N'Dour during the love scenes titled ""Seven Seconds"" . The motion picture was middlingly made by Uwe Boll who poured a lot of money into special effects ; however , being deemed worst film of 2005 by the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards .All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in several countries , but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. Having directed 25 movies up to 2011, Boll is panned by the critics and he has received lousy reviews. Only recommended to those who amuse those kind of adventure/action/horror films or those enjoy in general of the Uwe Boll cinema .The film will appeal to fantasy/SciFi buffs with action enough to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Terror/fantasy movies genre enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because dash horror , action , fights , shots and adventures are thrillingly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact.

2.0,"Bad, but in a Street Fighter way rather than an Eegah way","It has only been recently that Uwe Boll's seeming masterpiece, Alone In The Dark, has been available here for rental. It completely bypassed local theatres, and was available on DVD in America at least a year before here, which is rarely a good sign. Unlike Boll's previous effort, House Of The Dead, the problem is not so much in the performances or even the special effects. The real problem lies in the direction and editing. Articles have since sprung out of the woodwork describing Boll's inflated self-opinion and inability to work effectively with collaborators. It seems that this includes actors. Reid and Slater do their best with the roles that they have been assigned, but it becomes clear that they are given very little direction throughout the film. At one point, Slater and Reid appear to be running from the Alien-like creatures of the story through a warehouse. To say that they interact very little with their surroundings is an understatement. This scene could have been more convincing, in fact, if they had been running across a floor with a rear-projection behind them.No, the real problem in this film lies in the direction and editing. A sex scene appears with no linking into the preceding or following scenes. Adding to the film's woes is that test audiences were so confused by the plot that an opening crawl had to be added in order to make the plot easier to follow. Said plot basically follows Christian Slater, who looks nothing like the Edward Carnby of the video games, as he deals with supernatural creatures emerging in our plane of existence and a government agency attempting to deal with them. Exactly where this plot stems from, I do not know, and I have only briefly played one of the games, but I do not remember any of the embellishments Boll has provided (which telegraph themselves with fervor). Compounding the problem is that Boll requires his actors to describe the plot or the point of what we have seen in the scenes. That none of the plot can be inferred through the images makes Boll's incompetence as a director pretty obvious.To hear it from Boll during the featurette, Atari contacted him and asked him to adapt the game into film. The nonsense of this spin is shown by what outsiders have to sayabout Boll and his films. The writers of a rejected screenplay for House Of The Dead decided that they would rather remain in obscurity than become famous for working with Boll. Speaking as a writer myself, this tells me far more about Boll as a filmmaker than a million featurettes from the lousy DVDs made of his lousy films ever could. Adding insult to injury is that Nuclear Blast paid Boll and his cohorts enough money to make an album in order to have a few of their bands included in the soundtrack. If there were justice in the world, Nuclear Blast would be one of the many record labels outselling Sony by a twelve to one ratio. They are innovators, and have released some masterpieces from the likes of Therion or Agathodaimon. That they have to slum it in dreck like this while Sony saturates the market in their repetitive garbage only adds further insult to Alone In The Dark. I hope that thirty grand could be written off easily.Soundtracks and bad direction aside, the construction of the film is utterly terrible, too. I cannot really describe the ending for fear of ruining what little surprise the film has, but I bet that Uwe was paying very careful attention to the end of Resident Evil. It is a pity he did not learn that such images only work because of the context they are in, and that context needs to make a certain level of sense. I know it sounds hypocritical of me to call for a film to guide the audience through the plot, but at the very least, Alone In The Dark could have given a small breadcrumb trail, anything to make point A follow logically from point B, so to speak. The idea that we are meant to follow all this action going on in such a confined space, and then accept that some survivor got out and destroyed everyone (even the meaning of everyone is left pretty vague in this film) is pretty ludicrous. Others have described the patent unbelievability of Tara Reid as an archaeologist, but this is in fact one of the least of the film's problems.I gave Alone In The Dark a two out of ten. As a horror film, it is far too tame to horrify. As an action film, it is too stagnant to move the audience. As a serious acting piece, it has no drama to speak of. Without the lousy or idiotic production decisions, it also loses the unintentional comedy that made House Of The Dead bearable. In essence, it winds up in no man's land. See it if you need an example of how one man can be so blind to his own incompetence.",bad but street fighter way rather than eegah way,it has only been recently that uwe bolls seeming masterpiece alone dark has been available here rental it completely bypassed local theatres was available dvd america at least year before here which is rarely good sign unlike bolls previous effort house dead problem is not so much performances or even special effects real problem lies direction editing articles have since sprung out woodwork describing bolls inflated self opinion inability work effectively with collaborators it seems that this includes actors reid slater do their best with roles that they have been assigned but it becomes clear that they are given very little direction throughout film at one point slater reid appear be running alien like creatures story through warehouse say that they interact very little with their surroundings is understatement this scene could have been more convincing fact if they had been running across floor with rear projection behind them no real problem this film lies direction editing sex scene appears with no linking into preceding or following scenes adding films woes is that test audiences were so confused by plot that opening crawl had be added order make plot easier follow said plot basically follows christian slater who looks nothing like edward carnby video games as he deals with supernatural creatures emerging our plane existence government agency attempting deal with them exactly where this plot stems i do not know i have only briefly played one games but i do not remember any embellishments boll has provided which telegraph themselves with fervor compounding problem is that boll requires his actors describe plot or point what we have seen scenes that none plot can be inferred through images makes bolls incompetence as director pretty obvious hear it boll during featurette atari contacted him asked him adapt game into film nonsense this spin is shown by what outsiders have sayabout boll his films writers rejected screenplay house dead decided that they would rather remain obscurity than become famous working with boll speaking as writer myself this tells me far more about boll as filmmaker than million featurettes lousy dvds made his lousy films ever could adding insult injury is that nuclear blast paid boll his cohorts enough money make album order have few their bands included soundtrack if there were justice world nuclear blast would be one many record labels outselling sony by twelve one ratio they are innovators have released some masterpieces likes therion or agathodaimon that they have slum it dreck like this while sony saturates market their repetitive garbage only adds further insult alone dark i hope that thirty grand could be written off easily soundtracks bad direction aside construction film is utterly terrible too i cannot really describe ending fear ruining what little surprise film has but i bet that uwe was paying very careful attention end resident evil it is pity he did not learn that such images only work because context they are that context needs make certain level sense i know it sounds hypocritical me call film guide audience through plot but at very least alone dark could have given small breadcrumb trail anything make point follow logically point b so speak idea that we are meant follow all this action going such confined space then accept that some survivor got out destroyed everyone even meaning everyone is left pretty vague this film is pretty ludicrous others have described patent unbelievability tara reid as archaeologist but this is fact one least films problems i gave alone dark two out ten as horror film it is far too tame horrify as action film it is too stagnant move audience as serious acting piece it has no drama speak without lousy or idiotic production decisions it also loses unintentional comedy that made house dead bearable essence it winds up no mans land see it if you need example how one man can be so blind his own incompetence,0.5192006802721087,-0.031034580498866204,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.41}"

Not a gamer so not bothered about anything related to it. Christian Slater does a good Constantine impression whilst Tara Reid ........very bad actress. But the story is quick paces. Some good stunts. Pretty good effects for the time and some good gory moments also (the split head is awesome) So this is far from the worst film ever made. The one out of ten scores are just daft.

5.0,Vastly Underrated...,"First off, I haven't played the game 'Alone in the Dark' and this is the first Uwe Boll film I've ever seen. From the reviews I've read, the scathing criticism of Boll I've heard and all the message boards on IMDb, my expectations were way low. Game adaptations are inherently bad, the only exceptions I can think of are 'Mortal Kombat' and the 'Resident Evil' movies (yes, I like Paul W.S. Anderson too).Now that I've killed off two-thirds of IMDb's users by saying the above, let me kill off the rest by saying that I thought 'Alone in the Dark' was quite good. I'm a Christian Slater fan, for starters, and now I'm a Uwe Boll fan too. I reckon, as B-grade movie directors go, the guy's got talent. He handles the sex scene very well (without it being fifteen minutes long and featuring an inordinate amount of nudity and fading in and out all the time) and the film was fastly paced and tight. The visual effects were also amazingly well-done for such a film, the creatures (I forget what they're called) especially.I could overlook the problems with the script and the acting, but only because 'Alone in the Dark' is so suspenseful and genuinely interesting at times. There's never a dull nor slow moment to be found. I reckon 2/10 is rather harsh. I've seen worse films than this; much worse. While it may not sit well with gamers, 'Alone in the Dark' is one of the better B-grade horror films I've seen in years, just as long as you don't take it seriously.",vastly underrated,first off i havent played game alone dark this is first uwe boll film ive ever seen reviews ive read scathing criticism boll ive heard all message boards imdb my expectations were way low game adaptations are inherently bad only exceptions i can think are mortal kombat resident evil movies yes i like paul w s anderson too now that ive killed off two thirds imdbs users by saying above let me kill off rest by saying that i thought alone dark was quite good im christian slater fan starters now im uwe boll fan too i reckon as b grade movie directors go guys got talent he handles sex scene very well without it being fifteen minutes long featuring inordinate amount nudity fading out all time film was fastly paced tight visual effects were also amazingly well done such film creatures i forget what theyre called especially i could overlook problems with script acting but only because alone dark is so suspenseful genuinely interesting at times theres never dull nor slow moment be found i reckon 2 10 is rather harsh ive seen worse films than this much worse while it may not sit well with gamers alone dark is one better b grade horror films ive seen years just as long as you dont take it seriously,0.5154135338345865,-0.06489661654135337,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.21}"
1.0,You almost feel sorry for the actors,"This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen. However this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type.

6.0,Enjoyable Monster Fun,"I like this movie. It has a lot of extraneous material to sort through and you can let yourself get bogged down in that.

1.0,Not the worst Uwe Boll's movie,"Well, what can you say about a movie whose ""soldiers"" are equipped with paintball protections, even the weapons look like they are taken from paintball. This movie is a Mimic and Aliens rip-off, among others. Even the sex scene is really crappy . It amazes me how this Uwe Boll guy is still allowed to make movies, or even that he gets the money to make them. I mean, at one point, one of the dead ""soldiers"" starts moving before they change the scene. At least that made me laugh. This is the third movie made by Uwe Boll that I watch, the others two being ""In the name of the king"" and ""1968:Tunnel Rats"". They were both way worse, I didn't even get to laugh with those. I think that this Uwe Boll guy should make a last movie in which a character is send from the future to kill his mother before his birth, achieving such task, and then not make any more movies.",not worst uwe bolls movie,well what can you say about movie whose soldiers are equipped with paintball protections even weapons look like they are taken paintball this movie is mimic aliens rip off among others even sex scene is really crappy it amazes me how this uwe boll guy is still allowed make movies or even that he gets money make them i mean at one point one dead soldiers starts moving before they change scene at least that made me laugh this is third movie made by uwe boll that i watch others two being name king 1968 tunnel rats they were both way worse i didnt even get laugh with those i think that this uwe boll guy should make last movie which character is send future kill his mother before his birth achieving such task then not make any more movies,0.3599358974358975,0.045192307692307684,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.45, 'Fear': 0.15}"
,Movie Review,"The other day my roommate called me up and said he had two complimentary tickets to a special pre-screening to a new moving coming out soon: Alone in the Dark.If the name sounds familiar, it's probably because you're familiar with the video games by the same name. If not, don't worry, although the movie claims to be based off the games (games I know very well), I didn't see any similarities other than the names of the main characters.My friend and I wandered into the theatre and took our seats. Anxiously awaiting the movie. I was especially excited because the game Alone in the Dark ranks in my very exclusive list of all-time scariest games ever...it's only competition is Doom 3. The point is, I was expecting a movie that would scare my pants off and send chills up my spine, much like the first game did back in the early 90s.Before the movie started, a man came out and stood before us, and announced that we were the very first audience ever to see this movie, and he hoped we enjoyed it. The excitement built!The movie started...and it wasn't long before that excitement turned to confusion, and shortly thereafter, disappointment combined with a healthy dose of disbelief.This movie sucked! Plain and simple. The plot was, by far, the worst thing about the movie, followed not too distantly by the dialogue and cheesy acting. The only actor who did a halfway decent job was the main character, Edward Carnby (played by Christian Slater). In fact, I would go so far as to say he carried the entire movie.Please note: From here on, I will be making references to the movie that would be considered spoilers. Even references to how the movie ends. If you actually intend to see this movie even after reading this review, you may want to skip the part about the plot.Let's return to the plot for a moment. (This is where the bulk of the problems lie.) The plot can be summed up through the following words: broken, confusing, irrelevant, uninformed, and poorly written. Why?The movie has practically nothing to do with the games. The games were based off of an investigator who explored various ""supernatural"" phenomena, and became trapped in this haunted mansion. The entire point of the game was to get out of the mansion alive...something that was not so easy to do! The movie didn't take place in a mansion, really had very little to do with the supernatural and more about some sort of alien creatures. It wasn't a psychological thriller with some action interspersed, it was an action flick...and if it attempted to be the former in any way, it failed miserably...so much so I never noticed any elements of it.There were several questions raised in the movie that were never answered or even dealt with for that matter. There was this theme of some ancient civilization which apparently had something to do with these creatures, but it was never explained what the civilization had to do with the creatures, or where (or what) these creatures were to begin with.Several inconsistencies with elements of the movie. For instance (big spoiler ahead). It's established that these creatures cannot exist in the light. They're hurt by sunlight and various other types of light sources. Then, at the end, the main characters climb out of their underground ordeal, appear in the city, during the day, and notice that everyone is missing. (no bodies, no blood, no signs of struggle...just missing). Then, in broad daylight, one of these creatures jumps out at them and the movie ends. ...uh, folks...daylight. It seems the director forgot to pay attention to that little fact. This is one of many inconsistencies in the movie. It's rife with them.There was this (military? police? rebel?) institution called 713 which was apparently hunting these creatures (aliens?) for a while now. It was never established what this organization was, if they were part of the government or not, or anything about them. They just showed up and all the characters in the movie just accepted them as being in charge of things.The love scene. Completely gratuitous! There was no chemistry between the hero and the heroin. In fact, the only way one would know that there was any kind of attraction between them was that it was briefly established in the beginning that they used to be in a relationship. Then, for no apparent reason, in the midst of all this danger and alien creatures in the same building with them, bam. They go at it. Then, as if nothing had happened, the rest of the movie they continue on their way with absolutely no chemistry to the very end.Character Development...there was none.Several points where the movie moved way too fast or way too slow, causing either confusion or boredom. I could go on, I have a whole list of things I disliked about the movie, but I'll stop here. There were a couple good points to the movie, and it's only fair to state them. The introduction was well done and was relatively engaging. I'd go so far as to say the first scene was the best scene in the entire movie (although even that scene had several points to it which raised questions that were never answered or dealt with in any way - adding to the confusion later on). The cinematography in parts was creative and showed a level of quality that was far beyond this film. The special fx held their own and, for the most part, were impressive at points. Alone in the Dark could have followed in the footsteps of the games it was based on, and potentially done an amazing job. The games were incredibly frightening and established a mood of horror and suspense from the moment you started playing till long after you quit playing. This movie did nothing more than leave a feeling of disgust at the pit of my stomach, that it should represent a series of amazing games and fail so miserably at doing so.The sad fact is, my friend and I had the opportunity to see Alone in the Dark for free, and yet, somehow, we both came out of the ordeal feeling cheated.",movie review,other day my roommate called me up said he had two

3.0,"I'm actually in a minority to find ""Alone in the Dark"" one of Uwe Boll's better earlier films. Still terrible, but not his worst at all.","Whenever people think of Uwe Boll, they think of all of his films that can be considered bad. (If not terrible) And the film that most people point to as one of his worst is the 2005 release ""Alone in the Dark."" (Heck, it's the one I've seen many claim to be THE worst film he's made... and others claim it to be perhaps one of the worst films of all time.) It's the one that seems to get the most attention. The most publicity. And of course, the most hate.I'm not in that camp, though. Oddly enough. In fact, I'd be willing to argue that despite being a fairly terrible film, ""Alone in the Dark"" to me is arguably one of his best video-game-to-film adaptations. Something about it comes off as borderline ""So bad, it's good"" to me. And I honestly found it to be perhaps the best-directed film in his entire filmography, at least from a visual/composition standpoint.The film follows paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), as he struggles against various otherworldly threats, including deadly creatures, underground caverns, the delusions of a mad scientist, and other forces. At the same time, he reconnects with an old flame (Tara Reid) and comes to odds with government Bureau 713 and a former comrade. (Stephen Dorff.)The acting is... well. You know. ...bad. Slater is trying and seems to be having a blast, but he's still quite wooden. Reid is amusingly-bad in her attempts to come off as smart and serious. Dorff is probably the best, giving the only performance that seems SLIGHTLY decent. (Though still both over-done and under-done depending on the scene.) And supporting characters are all around the level of ""meh.""The script is a fairly incomprehensible mess. From scene to scene, you can't really grasp what's happening, what's relevant (or irrelevant), what character motivations are, etc. There's a lot of bizarre leaps in focus and there isn't really any clearly defined focus or main conflict. The film seems to be made up of various meandering subplots that don't quite fit together. In addition, the cinematography is bland. The music is sub-par. Effects range from ""excellent"" (some early bullet-time effects, while tacky, are very well-executed) to ""awful."" (Some of the creature effects being laugh-out-loud bad.) And there's a lot of little issues here and there throughout the production and presentation.This SHOULD be a 1 out of 10 film for sure. But there's just something about it. I just can't bring myself to give it that score. In part, it's because I do honestly believe that this is one of Boll's better films. And I believe that here, he shows off perhaps the best visual direction of his entire career. It actually has a few really cool shots that are well-composed, there's at least some creativity shown (even though it doesn't work) through attempts to be moody or exciting with key sequences, and it has the most style out of anything he's really done. Don't get me wrong... the film still isn't particularly well-directed. But it seems to have the most effort put in by Boll out of any of his films. It isn't cheap and rushed like ""House of the Dead"", nor overly ""gritty"" and sloppy like everything he's done lately. It looks the most like an actual decently-budgeted movie out of all of his films.In addition, something about this movie strikes me very-much as a great example of ""so bad, it's good."" Whether it be chuckling at lazy attempts to make characters look smart (giving Tara Reid glasses, for example), or poorly-executed action beats... I find this film very likable and entertaining because of how bad it is. And that counts for something.I think that this is definitely not Boll's worst film at all. I don't even think it's in his bottom-5. I found it amusingly bad, and with a surprising amount of style and effort. And that effort alone makes it better than much of his other work.I give this a very-bad 3 out of 10. Fans of bad movies (like me) should definitely give it a shot. You just might find it entertaining!",im actually minority find alone dark one uwe bolls better earlier films still terrible but not his worst at all,whenever people think uwe boll they think all his films that can be considered bad if not terrible film that most people point as one his worst is 2005 release alone dark heck its one ive seen many claim be worst film hes made others claim it be perhaps one worst films all time its one that seems get most attention most publicity course most hate im not that camp though oddly enough fact id be willing argue that despite being fairly terrible film alone dark me is arguably one his best video game film adaptations something about it comes off as borderline so bad its good me i honestly found it be perhaps best directed film his entire filmography at least visual composition standpoint film follows paranormal investigator edward carnby christian slater as he struggles against various otherworldly threats including deadly creatures underground caverns delusions mad scientist other forces at same time he reconnects with old flame tara reid comes odds with government bureau 713 former comrade stephen dorff acting is well you know bad slater is trying seems be having blast but hes still quite wooden reid is amusingly bad her attempts come off as smart serious dorff is probably best giving only performance that seems slightly decent though still both over done under done depending scene supporting characters are all around level meh script is fairly incomprehensible mess scene scene you cant really grasp whats happening whats relevant or irrelevant what character motivations are etc theres lot bizarre leaps focus there isnt really any clearly defined focus or main conflict film seems be made up various meandering subplots that dont quite fit together addition cinematography is bland music is sub par effects range excellent some early bullet time effects while tacky are very well executed awful some creature effects being laugh out loud bad theres lot little issues here there throughout production presentation this should be 1 out 10 film sure but theres just something about it i just cant bring myself give it that score part its because i do honestly believe that this is one bolls better films i believe that here he shows off perhaps best visual direction his entire career it actually has few really cool shots that are well composed theres at least some creativity shown even though it doesnt work through attempts be moody or exciting with key sequences it has most style out anything hes really done dont get me wrong film still isnt particularly well directed but it seems have most effort put by boll out any his films it isnt cheap rushed like house dead nor overly gritty sloppy like everything hes done lately it looks most like actual decently budgeted movie out all his films addition something about this movie strikes me very much as great example so bad its good whether it be chuckling at lazy attempts make characters look smart giving tara reid glasses example or poorly executed action beats i find this film very likable entertaining because how bad it is that counts something i think that this is definitely not bolls worst film at all i dont even think its his bottom 5 i found it amusingly bad with surprising amount style effort that effort alone makes it better than much his other work i give this very bad 3 out 10 fans bad movies like me should definitely give it shot you just might find it entertaining,0.5510835058661145,0.01244409937888201,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.24}"
3.0,It's not even fun to watch and make fun of.,"Some of the hatred for this film has been exaggerated. Sometimes people like to have something to rag on no matter what - right now, for the Internet film community, it seems to be Uwe Boll - and judging from quotes I've read by him, as well as movies I've seen, he deserves a lot of it.But some of the hatred goes too far. ""BloodRayne"" was already on the IMDb Low 100 before it even really got launched into theaters.I'll give you an example of the exaggeration regarding this film: One critic I read claimed the opening narration went on for nearly ten minutes, however it lasts perhaps a minute at the most.The dialogue is pretty bad, and the beginning with Christian Slater telling a young child on a plane that his mother is wrong about being afraid of the dark is unintentionally hilarious. There are other gems such as, ""Looks like a dead end up ahead. I better take a look."" Or how about Tara Reid - a supposed archaeologist (hah!) - referring to Newfoundland as ""New Found Land."" I read here on IMDb that Reid was invited on Jay Leno and wasn't even able to give a definition of her profession in the film.Christian Slater I pretty much just felt sorry for throughout the film - he's such a good actor and his resorting to crap like this and ""Hollow Man 2"" is a real shame. I am still hoping he makes a comeback. For what it's worth his performance here actually rises above the laughable material.The special effects are pretty bad, but once again not nearly as bad as I was expecting after reading some message board posts here.Overall I was expecting something so bad I would have a fun time laughing at it. Unfortunately this film is not laugh-out-loud bad, it's just plain BAD. It's not the worst film ever made - it's not on par with Ed Wood - it is actually just equivalent to most Z-grade straight-to-video flicks out there. If Boll's name had not been attached to the project and it hadn't attracted a theatrical run, I'm sure it would have a slightly higher rating on here and less of a ""fan base"" so to speak.I'm not supporting the film or saying it's remotely good - it isn't - but I am saying it's about as bad as any other straight-to-video horror garbage.I wouldn't recommend it because I didn't even have a fun time watching it for giggles - it's just a really lame film that takes itself way too seriously and perhaps its only positive attribute is that it has some amount of (admittedly ripped-off) style.",its not even fun watch make fun,some hatred this film has been exaggerated sometimes people like have something rag no matter what right now internet film community it seems be uwe boll judging quotes ive read by him as well as movies ive seen he deserves lot it but some hatred goes too far bloodrayne was already imdb low 100 before it even really got launched into theaters ill give you example exaggeration regarding this film one critic i read claimed opening narration went nearly ten minutes however it lasts perhaps minute at most dialogue is pretty bad beginning with christian slater telling young child plane that his mother is wrong about being afraid dark is unintentionally hilarious there are other gems such as looks like dead end up ahead i better take look or how about tara reid supposed archaeologist hah referring newfoundland as new found land i read here imdb that reid was invited jay leno wasnt even able give definition her profession film christian slater i pretty much just felt sorry throughout film hes such good actor his resorting crap like this hollow man 2 is real shame i am still hoping he makes comeback what its worth his performance here actually rises above laughable material special effects are pretty bad but once again not nearly as bad as i was expecting after reading some message board posts here overall i was expecting something so bad i would have fun time laughing at it unfortunately this film is not laugh out loud bad its just plain bad its not worst film ever made its not par with ed wood it is actually just equivalent most z grade straight video flicks out there if bolls name had not been attached project it hadnt attracted theatrical run im sure it would have slightly higher rating here less fan base so speak im not supporting film or saying its remotely good it isnt but i am saying its about as bad as any other straight video horror garbage i wouldnt recommend it because i didnt even have fun time watching it giggles its just really lame film that takes itself way too seriously perhaps its only positive attribute is that it has some amount admittedly ripped off style,0.5228720956981829,-0.022214379823075465,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.26}"

3.0,"Tara Reid Can't Act, and This Movie Truly Sucks","This should be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, I like ""Congo,"" and ""Allan Quatermaine"" movies. I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. Let's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.1. Horror/Sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. I'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot.So this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do...I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now on to some of the many faults.Tara Reid. Even though the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is truly awful. We're not just talking bad, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year. I don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. I mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.Even with Reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time. The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs I zoned out during. The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a ""Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities."" I may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, ""photonic"" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.Jesus, I can't even being to wade through the clichéd elements. The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. I guess he's infected? How did that happen? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which ""fuse"" with the spine of their host)Of course, Slater is, like Blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug ""didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock,"" thank god. Oh, and the people with these ""fused"" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. Yeah we get zombies.So lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.Also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.Not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie.",tara reid cant act this movie truly sucks,this should be my kind movie even if it sucked it still should have been right up my alley hell i like congo allan quatermaine movies i have soft spot my heart silly alien demon adventure movies lets go over why i decided watch this first place 1 horror sci fi almost always intrigues me 2 im big fan archaeology this movie does involve rare treasure 3 super natural enemies with quality fx 4 christian slater dorf i generally enjoy 5 tara reid is hot so this movie had potential at least cheese horror section video store but boy did it suck ass only redeeming aspects are slater dorf not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do i mean lets face it both are melodramatic but now some many faults tara reid even though movie as whole is worse reids performance is truly awful were not just talking bad im talking about nominating tara reid worst performance year i dont know if she is capable acting but playing museum curator is simply out her league completely watching her try carry roll educated scientist wasnt much different than what you get watching setup bad porn i mean this isnt just bad it is laughably bad oh those you curious she doesnt get naked only down bra silly totally unnecessary love scene even with reids performance perhaps movie could have worked but plot is what dominates plot seems written by 10 year old i hadnt realized this was video game adaptation until after watching dvd otherwise i would have appreciated stupidity real time storyline jumps back forth slaters childhood at orphanage where he gets flashbacks something terrible that happened he has amnesia course his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713 paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something slater had leave because he was too rebellious i guess you never really know unless it was one those voice overs i zoned out during movie starts with slater hunting artifacts obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with chilean mercenary force specializing selling rare antiquities i may have exact quote wrong but you get idea there is evil doctor that wants unleash some hellions earth no reason given experiments children super demon alien human hybrids photonic bullets demon things cant stand sunlight course slater dorf try save everyone jesus i cant even being wade through clich d elements script badly needed reworking narrow focus provide some depth i mean why is this evil scientist so damn evil oh right humans are doomed he is just trying save human race i guess hes infected how did that happen oh right he has one evil demon things cage draws its blood shoot into himself how hell did that happen why where did he get super slugs oh yes they use old sci fi stand by parasitic aliens demons which fuse with spine their host course slater is like blade half super slug powered but his slug didnt fully fuse due electrical shock thank god oh people with these fused spines have no idea theyre half alien demon act as good members community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies yeah we get zombies so lots crap that could be entertaining but none it is also ending is completely stupid as everything turns out be not that big deal fix first place at least nothing little dynamite cant handle not very worst thing youll see but truly bad movie,0.5714063559896893,-0.12070885904219235,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
1.0,There's nothing likable about this movie,"On my list of ""worst movies ever made"". There is nothing likable about this movie. It's totally worthless noise.Honestly, I cannot think of one single redeeming moment... the story is stupid, the script is trite, the characters are 1-dimentional (as is the acting); I could care less if they lived or died. There's nothing special about the effects, nor the cinematography, nor the score. Several pointless scenes of mindless, ear-numbing shoot-em-up's that neither moved the plot along, nor offered any entertainment value, whatsoever.No one should be subjected to this film, ever, under any circumstances.
