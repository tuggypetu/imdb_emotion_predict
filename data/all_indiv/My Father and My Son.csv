8.0,"""When a person grows up, do his dreams become smaller?""","I'm gradually becoming less and less surprised when I see a foreign film that's every bit as good as those produced by Americans or the Brits. This was my first Turkish film, and for those of you struggling to find it, I would direct you to Youtube where you can find it in it's entirety with English subtitles. As the translated title suggests, the story is about a man struggling to come to terms with a father who disowned him, and his feelings of growing away from his own seven year old son. The back story of Sadik's (Fikret Kuskan) personal history does not fully come to light until well into the picture, when we learn that he became an anarchist journalist, much to the dismay of his father, who had designs for his son to take over the family farm upon attaining an agricultural degree. For viewers with a Turkish background, the conflict that resulted in Sadik's jail time and torture will probably be understood better within the context of that country's history, so for someone like myself, a lot of that perspective is lost. However that doesn't affect the impact of the story when it's finally revealed that Sadik's reconciliation with his father occurred because of his impending death due to a pulmonary edema condition. The man did a noble thing for his own son Deniz (Ege Tanman) by returning him to the village of Sadik's childhood to remain with family and friends. I would challenge the viewer to maintain a dry eye as the mystery of father/grandfather Huseyin's (Çetin Tekindor) 'secret room' reveals Sadim's happy and hopeful youth before he left his family. One comes away from the film with a serene sense of family bond that transcends nationality, as in the end, we are all humans subject to the same emotions of love and loyalty.",when person grows up do his dreams become smaller,im gradually becoming less less surprised when i see foreign film thats every bit as good as those produced by americans or brits this was my first turkish film those you struggling find it i would direct you youtube where you can find it its entirety with english subtitles as translated title suggests story is about man struggling come terms with father who disowned him his feelings growing away his own seven year old son back story sadiks fikret kuskan personal history does not fully come light until well into picture when we learn that he became anarchist journalist much dismay his father who had designs his son take over family farm upon attaining agricultural degree viewers with turkish background conflict that resulted sadiks jail time torture will probably be understood better within context that countrys history so someone like myself lot that perspective is lost however that doesnt affect impact story when its finally revealed that sadiks reconciliation with his father occurred because his impending death due pulmonary edema condition man did noble thing his own son deniz ege tanman by returning him village sadiks childhood remain with family friends i would challenge viewer maintain dry eye as mystery father grandfather huseyins etin tekindor secret room reveals sadims happy hopeful youth before he left his family one comes away film with serene sense family bond that transcends nationality as end we are all humans subject same emotions love loyalty,0.46120689655172414,0.15804597701149428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,A masterpiece that must be seen by everyone!,"A masterpiece that must be seen by everyone!It's the better film I have seen so far. It's not only about the relationships between fathers and sons, or the sequences from a coup d' etat, especially against leftist people. There are a lot of things and ideas included. For example the attitude of a former lover, wounded, married to another man, but still carrying. Its an insight to the human relationships as a whole, the role of the family in Mediterranean countries. This does not mean that people from the North for example will not understand or will not be moved. But the situations depicted, fit especially to Turks, or Greeks (like me), or perhaps Italians. The director is really one of the highest class. I had previously watched his later film Issiz Adam (Always alone), and I was so impressed that I looked for another of his movies, so I found this film. I found very good the actor who played the young boy. I was really shocked from the scene of the father regretting for his behavior, it looked very much like a Greek ancient tragedy. Also the music of the film was excellent. Everyone must see this film. Not only he will like it, but I am sure that he will be moved.",masterpiece that must be seen by everyone,masterpiece that must be seen by everyone its better film i have seen so far its not only about relationships between fathers sons or sequences coup d etat especially against leftist people there are lot things ideas included example attitude former lover wounded married another man but still carrying its insight human relationships as whole role family mediterranean countries this does not mean that people north example will not understand or will not be moved but situations depicted fit especially turks or greeks like me or perhaps italians director is really one highest class i had previously watched his later film issiz adam always alone i was so impressed that i looked another his movies so i found this film i found very good actor who played young boy i was really shocked scene father regretting his behavior it looked very much like greek ancient tragedy also music film was excellent everyone must see this film not only he will like it but i am sure that he will be moved,0.5597106481481482,0.19414930555555554,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,One of the best Turkish movies ever,"The movie starts on the days of military government, which started Sep.12th, 1980, and lasted 3 years (Effects of this action against democracy lasted more than 15 years). A young socialist newspaper writer (Fikret Kuskan) loses his wife on birth of his only son on the very first day of the military action, because he can not find any help for delivery of the child. After 6 years past, the father was desperate to find any jobs on the papers, which are now supporters of the new order, and decides to return his father (Çetin Tekindor)'s home in a small village near Izmir: A house that he has left years ago fighting his father's wills to make him a person that his father would like him to be.I can not even summarize the rest of the movie, since one should see the movie himself/herself to understand the encounters of two strangers, father and son. One should notice the mother (Humeyra)'s role on the relationship (or non-relationship) of these two different men, and the grandson (Ege Tanman).If you have a Mediterrenean blood, Greek, Italian, whatever, you will find many things in this movie.

10.0,An Incredible Movie,"As I watched that movie, I saw the Turkish relationships in the best way that it could be shown. A very good choice of cast is the most powerful criterion of the success of the movie. Humeyra, the grandmother is a very talented woman in acting. Emotional scenes become more frequent while we see the movie to get to the end. Unfortunate events make the Turkish people get closer to each other. The movie shows that perfectly. Hospitality, love, grief, laughs... Everything is included in this movie. An emotional breakthrough.

Every person I know who had the chance to watch this wonderful movie have cried -especially during the second half.. I applause everyone involved in the production of this magnificent piece of work.. Really brilliant work, presenting some top-notch performances (esp by Humeyra and Cetin Tekindor) and a clever collection of spectacular moments. No special effects, no superhuman strengths no fantastic landscapes.. Just human and the ordinary feelings. I felt some rush to call my mom and dad just after the movie to be sure that they are OK and to make them know once again that I really care about them.

10.0,AWESOME - the word is not enough,"I have never seen a movie ever before, that brings a tear to anybody who sees it, at the sound of a violin, or a single word uttered.Babam Ve Oglum.Director: Cagan ImrakLead Characters: Ege Tanman ... Deniz Çetin Tekindor ... Hüseyin Fikret Kuskan ... Sadik Hümeyra ... Babanne Serif Sezer ... Teyze Yetkin Dikinciler ... SalimI Salute them all. I have always despised the entertainment industry, most of all the Film industry, at the back of my mind, though I fancy a career there. I have always thought that half the money that goes into movie production or theatres or things like that could feed so many people out there or give them a job, get a living for them.If someone's going to bring to the screen a movie like Babam ve Oglum, I'd never ever utter a single word against the industry. You won't believe that one movie can affect you so much for the moment that you, even if you haven't cried since 5th grade, would be overwhelmed so much that you'd cry more than the characters on screen. Especially when you watch it alone, without anyone to distract you from the scenes. I have never felt the urge to cry for a long time. This movie reminded me of a lot of things that were hidden in me, that I strongly urge everyone who has had even a glance of this page to watch it at any cost. A must watch movie.Apart from the Director, who deserves to be recognized at the highest level, I must mention a few words about the background score. NO other BGM I have heard has ever got even close to this. . Out of this World.Finally, Coming to the story, this movie is about a father, who, after the loss of his wife, takes his little son back to his hometown (from where he had run away, defying his dad) because he suffers from a lung disorder. He wants to ensure that his child has a home when he's gone, and decides to confront his father and tell him about his condition and reconcile one final time before the final goodbye. And the characters portray the situations and experiences so convincingly that I couldn't help but put their names on top of this post.I am sure that this will remain my most favourite movie of all time for a long time to come.Bravo.",awesome word is not enough,i have never seen movie ever before that brings tear anybody who sees it at sound violin or single word uttered babam ve oglum director cagan imraklead characters ege tanman deniz etin tekindor h seyin fikret kuskan sadik h meyra babanne serif sezer teyze yetkin dikinciler salimi salute them all i have always despised entertainment industry most all film industry at back my mind though i fancy career there i have always thought that half money that goes into movie production or theatres or things like that could feed so many people out there or give them job get living them if someones going bring screen movie like babam ve oglum id never ever utter single word against industry you wont believe that one movie can affect you so much moment that you even if you havent cried since 5th grade would be overwhelmed so much that youd cry more than characters screen especially when you watch it alone without anyone distract you scenes i have never felt urge cry long time this movie reminded me lot things that were hidden me that i strongly urge everyone who has had even glance this page watch it at any cost must watch movie apart director who deserves be recognized at highest level i must mention few words about background score no other bgm i have heard has ever got even close this out this world finally coming story this movie is about father who after loss his wife takes his little son back his hometown where he had run away defying his dad because he suffers lung disorder he wants ensure that his child has home when hes gone decides confront his father tell him about his condition reconcile one final time before final goodbye characters portray situations experiences so convincingly that i couldnt help but put their names top this post i am sure that this will remain my most favourite movie all time long time come bravo,0.5137352790578597,0.14297235023041477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"

,In case you come across 'Babam ve Oglum'...,"This movie came out in Turkey late 2005, without much advertising. It's a small family drama, set largely in western rural turkey in 1987. Within a couple of weeks, the film became a smash hit solely through word-of-mouth. Since then, it has received every national award and has become the third-biggest grossing film of the country's history by mid-March (it could go even higher, considering it's still playing in theaters after several months). It is indeed a good movie, but i doubt it'll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It's well-written, well-acted and well-shot; but some of the jokes, and especially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm will be lost on international audiences i'm afraid. Similarly, the film doesn't give much information about the political events that unfold in the background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is that it reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films, from the industry's heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerker melodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted, the melodrama bits are rather manipulative, but effective nonetheless. I heard that a tissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to the ingoing audiences, don't know if it's true though. My one (small) problem with the film is a few anachronistic details, but i guess they wouldn't even be noticed by someone who wasn't around then and there. If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way (not very likely, but anyway), give it a shot. It's worth watching just to see the little kid in the leading role.",case you come across babam ve oglum,this movie came out turkey late 2005 without much advertising its small family drama set largely western rural turkey 1987 within couple weeks film became smash hit solely through word mouth since then it has received every national award has become third biggest grossing film countrys history by mid march it could go even higher considering its still playing theaters after several months it is indeed good movie but i doubt itll reach same kind wide audiences outside country its well written well acted well shot but some jokes especially local accent that adds movie lot its charm will be lost international audiences im afraid similarly film doesnt give much information about political events that unfold background i think one reasons film did so well is that it reflects atmosphere older turkish films industrys heyday sixties its mixture comedy tearjerker melodrama catches very subtle balance granted melodrama bits are rather manipulative but effective nonetheless i heard that tissue company did campaign where they distributed tissues ingoing audiences dont know if its true though my one small problem with film is few anachronistic details but i guess they wouldnt even be noticed by someone who wasnt around then there if you come across this movie at local festival or some other way not very likely but anyway give it shot its worth watching just see little kid leading role,0.31674436674436673,0.009722222222222217,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"

8.0,Unabashed Melodrama with its Roots in Yeşilçam,"A huge hit on its first release in 2005, BABAM VE OĞLUM (MY FATHER AND MY SON) is an unabashed melodrama with the emphasis on excess.The story is a straightforward one: Sadık (Fikret Kuşkan) has to deliver his first child alone, when there is no one to take his wife Aysun (Tuba Büyüküstün) to the hospital. The wife dies, leaving Sadık a single parent on the first day of the military coup taking place in the Republic of Turkey on 12 September 1980.Time passes: Sadık is imprisoned and tortured for his political views; but on his release, he leaves İstanbul with his son Deniz (Ege Tanman) to return to the family home near İzmir. He receives a frosty welcome from his father Hüseyin (Çetin Tekindor) who has never forgiven Sadık for quitting his studies in agriculture in İstanbul and turning to politics instead. The rest of the movie focuses on the way familial relationships change, as well as how people cope with an unexpected tragedy.Director Çağan Irmak looks at the oppressive influence of the past on the present; not only does it affect relationships between Sadık and Hüseyin, but it significantly dictated Sadık's love-life too. Returning to his home-town, Sadık is at once attracted and repelled by its familiarity; those who have never left - even for a short time - remain blinkered in their world-views. On the other hand BABAM VE OĞLUM shows how families stick together in times of crisis, and can resolve their own problems so long as they are prepared to acknowledge them in the first place.The narrative contrasts Sadık's story with Deniz's imaginative fantasies, in which the little boy positions himself as the hero. In the first part of the film they can be read as a retreat from reality, as Deniz tries to cope with the trauma of moving to a new town and coping with a new life. By the end, however, he has discovered that such fantasies might change, once he grows up. They will remain fantasies, but they will fulfill a different function in his life.The film is full of major scenes of confrontation and reconciliation, with Irmak's camera-work designed to achieve maximum dramatic effect through the use of close-ups, panning shots, dissolves, and two- shots, complemented by a florid musical score (by Evanthia Reboutsika). Although the narrative celebrates excess - of emotion, of feeling and of reconciliation - it does not seem in any way forced. In fact, it is as convincing and emotion-provoking as the best Yeşilçam melodramas of the past. Clearly Irmak planned BABAM VE OĞLUM as an homage to the genre, and he accomplishes his task with élan. Definitely worth more than one viewing.",unabashed melodrama with its roots ye il am,huge hit its first release 2005 babam ve o lum my father my son is unabashed melodrama with emphasis excess story is straightforward one sad k fikret ku kan has deliver his first child alone when there is no one take his wife aysun tuba b y k st n hospital wife dies leaving sad k single parent first day military coup taking place republic turkey 12 september 1980 time passes sad k is imprisoned tortured his political views but his release he leaves i stanbul with his son deniz ege tanman return family home near i zmir he receives frosty welcome his father h seyin etin tekindor who has never forgiven sad k quitting his studies agriculture i stanbul turning politics instead rest movie focuses way familial relationships change as well as how people cope with unexpected tragedy director irmak looks at oppressive influence past present not only does it affect relationships between sad k h seyin but it significantly dictated sad ks love life too returning his home town sad k is at once attracted repelled by its familiarity those who have never left even short time remain blinkered their world views other hand babam ve o lum shows how families stick together times crisis can resolve their own problems so long as they are prepared acknowledge them first place narrative contrasts sad ks story with denizs imaginative fantasies which little boy positions himself as hero first part film they can be read as retreat reality as deniz tries cope with trauma moving new town coping with new life by end however he has discovered that such fantasies might change once he grows up they will remain fantasies but they will fulfill different function his life film is full major scenes confrontation reconciliation with irmaks camera work designed achieve maximum dramatic effect through use close ups panning shots dissolves two shots complemented by florid musical score by evanthia reboutsika although narrative celebrates excess emotion feeling reconciliation it does not seem any way forced fact it is as convincing emotion provoking as best ye il am melodramas past clearly irmak planned babam ve o lum as homage genre he accomplishes his task with lan definitely worth more than one viewing,0.5264387573211102,0.03368559545030133,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.28}"

The story may not be all that original but the way it is told is just wonderful. Lot's of humor (we laughed a lot) and real tragedy (we really needed that handkerchief at the end). I love the parts where you get carried away in the little boy's dreams. That surreal view shows us the differences in thinking between an adult and a child.

9.0,Great acting in an entertaining drama,"The acting was perfect in this movie from the kid (Deniz) to Çetin Tekindor (Hüseyin Aga). All player did their job in a great performance. Also the places the film shot was great. My grandfather lives in a similar village, and I used to go to there in summers in my early ages. I went to back again to my childhood when I was watching the movie. It reflects the life style of those places in a very good manner and reality. No detail was skipped. Also the director mixed the drama and joy in the movie very well so that you can laugh suddenly when you pity for something you see in the movie. This was, I think, a great directing success for the new generation director, Çagan Irmak. So, this a ""must to see"" film I think, especially for the Turkish viewers (It includes so much domestic features). But international viewers can also get a real good taste of it, because main themes (such as family bonds, love of son) in the movie are humane things.",great acting entertaining drama,acting was perfect this movie kid deniz etin tekindor h seyin aga all player did their job great performance also places film shot was great my grandfather lives similar village i used go there summers my early ages i went back again my childhood when i was watching movie it reflects life style those places very good manner reality no detail was skipped also director mixed drama joy movie very well so that you can laugh suddenly when you pity something you see movie this was i think great directing success new generation director agan irmak so this must see film i think especially turkish viewers it includes so much domestic features but international viewers can also get real good taste it because main themes such as family bonds love son movie are humane things,0.4302918069584737,0.33381593714927044,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.26}"

5.0,An intense emotional drama,"At its core ""My Father and My Son"" is another old man - young kid story done just right. While it is not as amazing or as stunning as many reviews proclaim it is still a very good movie. It is prone to sentimentality sometimes, but that is more of a cultural thing. While acting wasn't spot on in a couple of places, mostly everybody has done a very good job and though it may appear that the actors are overacting you have to keep in mind that different cultures have different norms and different ways of expressing emotions.""My Father and My Son"" is not groundbreaking, but It is both touching and humorous without falling in too many clichés.

10.0,"Simply amazing, drama at its best!","It's one of those films which really affect you deep. The movie somehow makes ordinary places, ordinary people and ordinary events become interesting. I think it's due to the way Cagan Irmak (writer and director) cleverly and carefully blends everything. The movie is definitely not like a Hollywood production, maybe more like a European film. The film has many enjoyable moments but it's mainly emotional. The actings are magnificent, the story is heart-breaking and the places are so real. All performances were remarkable, but I should say I was over impressed by Cetin Tekindor's (Huseyin Aga) acting. While the bitter truths about life and family relations are portrayed perfectly, the movie also reflects life from the innocent eyes of a child. Personally, the local rural village life took me back to my some good memories. There is no need to tell what happens in the film as enough is said in the plot summary. More would only spoil it. But, it should be noted that even though the plot may sound political, the film is actually not.The movie came out without much advertising, but in short time became very popular - won many awards in Turkey and some in Europe. Not much to say... brilliant work. If you haven't seen it, I advise you watch it whenever possible. If you don't feel like crying in this movie, you will feel sorry for yourself.",simply amazing drama at its best,its one those films which really affect you deep movie somehow makes ordinary places ordinary people ordinary events become interesting i think its due way cagan irmak writer director cleverly carefully blends everything movie is definitely not like hollywood production maybe more like european film film has many enjoyable moments but its mainly emotional actings are magnificent story is heart breaking places are so real all performances were remarkable but i should say i was over impressed by cetin tekindors huseyin aga acting while bitter truths about life family relations are portrayed perfectly movie also reflects life innocent eyes child personally local rural village life took me back my some good memories there is no need tell what happens film as enough is said plot summary more would only spoil it but it should be noted that even though plot may sound political film is actually not movie came out without much advertising but short time became very popular won many awards turkey some europe not much say brilliant work if you havent seen it i advise you watch it whenever possible if you dont feel like crying this movie you will feel sorry yourself,0.5156976744186047,0.2408139534883721,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,May God Bless Turkish Cinema for delivering The BEST FAMILY-EMOTIONS FILM EVER !,"My Father and My Son (2005) : Brief Review -May God Bless Turkish Cinema for delivering The BEST FAMILY-EMOTIONS FILM EVER ! I love those moments when the film is over and i am sobbing & sniffing. I love it writing a film review with teary eyes and wrenched heart. After seeing more than Ten Top class Family dramas in Hollywood, Bollywood and Indian Cinema finally i found something which i can call 'The Best Family Drama Ever'. Family emotions were never so new and never so touching before. I know Emotional Family Drama is nothing new, it's the same old story but i don't know how this film managed to pull off the same old stuff with such a new and innovative way? My Father And My Son is story of Sadik who left his father and Mother years ago and now is blessed by a Child. He returns to his Father and Mother's house so that his Son can have a Home. See there is nothing new or outstanding in the plot but the storytelling is New and Outstanding. The way film is narrated by a Child who is living Real Life and Fantasy together, the way things are mixed up, the way memories from old days are used, the way Father and Son relationship is explored, everything is so Emotional and for a change so Clever. I don't remember watching such an intelligent narrative in this genre. All actors make this one look like a real family, they create thier place in your heart because every character is different in nature and you are forced to love them all. Background Music is so beautiful and mesmerizing, i could feel it in all those emotional moments. Direction is Top Notch. A rare case when i don't have any complaints to make. My Father and My Son is a story for everyone who love thier kids, fathers and thier family and that's why it is Universal subject. It would be shameful for you if you miss this MASTERPIECE..RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",may god bless turkish cinema delivering best family emotions film ever,my father my son 2005 brief review may god bless turkish cinema delivering best family emotions film ever i love those moments when film is over i am sobbing sniffing i love it writing film review with teary eyes wrenched heart after seeing more than ten top class family dramas hollywood bollywood indian cinema finally i found something which i can call best family drama ever family emotions were never so new never so touching before i know emotional family drama is nothing new its same old story but i dont know how this film managed pull off same old stuff with such new innovative way my father my son is story sadik who left his father mother years ago now is blessed by child he returns his father mothers house so that his son can have home see there is nothing new or outstanding plot but storytelling is new outstanding way film is narrated by child who is living real life fantasy together way things are mixed up way memories old days are used way father son relationship is explored everything is so emotional change so clever i dont remember watching such intelligent narrative this genre all actors make this one look like real family they create thier place your heart because every character is different nature you are forced love them all background music is so beautiful mesmerizing i could feel it all those emotional moments direction is top notch rare case when i dont have any complaints make my father my son is story everyone who love thier kids fathers thier family thats why it is universal subject it would be shameful you if you miss this masterpiece rating 9 10 by,0.48383838383838385,0.26292929292929296,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.17}"
