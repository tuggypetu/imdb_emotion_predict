10.0,The most relevant French film of the last 20 years,"'Mean Streets' in french - and so much more. While there are so many references to Scorsese that you could almost call it an homage, this French milestone deals with the disillusioned youth who live in the outskirts of Paris in such an elegant - and honest - way, that I would go so far as to call it the most relevant French film of the last 20 years. But it's also a cinematic masterpiece and great, often hilarious entertainment. Everything fits: the musical choices, the outstanding performances by the 3 main characters, the beautiful cinematography and flawless direction. And, perhaps most of all, THE perfect script. As much a realistic portrayal of a torn society as it is an artistic achievement, 'La Haine' is essential viewing.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",most relevant french film last 20 years,mean streets french so much more while there are so many references scorsese that you could almost call it homage this french milestone deals with disillusioned youth who live outskirts paris such elegant honest way that i would go so far as call it most relevant french film last 20 years but its also cinematic masterpiece great often hilarious entertainment everything fits musical choices outstanding performances by 3 main characters beautiful cinematography flawless direction perhaps most all perfect script as much realistic portrayal torn society as it is artistic achievement la haine is essential viewing my vote 10 out 10favorite films masterpieces low budget b movies tv shows reviewed,0.5347656250000001,0.301266571969697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Hate Begets Hate,"Reminiscent of Costas-Gavras' film Z with its rapid-fire dialogue and staccato rhythms, La Haine (Hate) directed by 28 year-old Mathieu Kassovitz, is a passionate look at racial tensions at a Paris housing project. Although drug dealing, urban decay, and police brutality have been shown in films before, rarely have they had the sense of vitality and urgency shown in La Haine. Three friends from different ethnic backgrounds live in the Bluebell housing projects on the outskirts of Paris. This is not the Paris of travel brochures or films like Amelie, but a desolate urban landscape, harsh and grim with housing projects that look as if they could be in any big city in the world. Vinz (Vincent Cassel), is a working class Jew; Hubert (Hubert Kounde), the most intelligent and self-reflective of the three, is an African boxer; and Said (Said Taghmaoui), an Arab from North Africa is younger but just as embittered. The film depicts their rage against the police whom they see as oppressors. Marginalized economically and politically, without jobs, parents who care, or hope for the future, the streets are their home and they are open targets for police who are shown as brutal and racist. In one startling scene, a veteran cop taunts and physically abuses Said and Hubert while training a rookie cop. The rookie can only look on and shake his head in disbelief. Shot in black and white, La Haine shows a single day in the lives of the three friends. Following a major riot in which a local teenager, Abdel, is critically wounded by the police, Vinz, the most volatile of the group, vows that if Abdel dies he will kill a cop to get even. Hubert wants to restrain him, and Said doesn't seem to care either way, as long as he can get his money from a drug dealer named Snoopy. When Vinz finds a Smith & Wesson 44 lost by the police during the riots, the spiral of violence escalates and builds toward a memorable conclusion. La Haine does not offer any solutions to social problems but clearly shows the anger and frustration of people who feel trapped by their circumstances. In its depiction of a society in free-fall, it also has immediacy. Three weeks after the film was released, riots broke out in the Brixton section of London, following the death of a young black man in police custody. Though it is a wake-up call for action on society's growing gap between rich and poor, La Haine makes a powerful statement that violence does not solve anything and that hate begets hate. Someone should pass the word to a few of the world leaders.",hate begets hate,reminiscent costas gavras film z with its rapid fire dialogue staccato rhythms la haine hate directed by 28 year old mathieu kassovitz is passionate look at racial tensions at paris housing project although drug dealing urban decay police brutality have been shown films before rarely have they had sense vitality urgency shown la haine three friends different ethnic backgrounds live bluebell housing projects outskirts paris this is not paris travel brochures or films like amelie but desolate urban landscape harsh grim with housing projects that look as if they could be any big city world vinz vincent cassel is working class jew hubert hubert kounde most intelligent self reflective three is african boxer said said taghmaoui arab north africa is younger but just as embittered film depicts their rage against police whom they see as oppressors marginalized economically politically without jobs parents who care or hope future streets are their home they are open targets police who are shown as brutal racist one startling scene veteran cop taunts physically abuses said hubert while training rookie cop rookie can only look shake his head disbelief shot black white la haine shows single day lives three friends following major riot which local teenager abdel is critically wounded by police vinz most volatile group vows that if abdel dies he will kill cop get even hubert wants restrain him said doesnt seem care either way as long as he can get his money drug dealer named snoopy when vinz finds smith wesson 44 lost by police during riots spiral violence escalates builds toward memorable conclusion la haine does not offer any solutions social problems but clearly shows anger frustration people who feel trapped by their circumstances its depiction society free fall it also has immediacy three weeks after film was released riots broke out brixton section london following death young black man police custody though it is wake up call action societys growing gap between rich poor la haine makes powerful statement that violence does not solve anything that hate begets hate someone should pass word few world leaders,0.45382326007326007,-0.07831855644355645,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,"""...it's not how you fall that matters. It's how you land.""","After watching this film I reflected back on a whole host of films I've seen produced by Warner Brothers back in the Forties and Fifties, having to do with the subject of poverty and how that can lead to crime and lost lives. In a lot of cases, civic and moral dilemmas could often be resolved with right winning out over wrong in the end. In today's world, 'right' often comes up empty handed, and often there's a fine line between differentiating the good from the bad. In many cases, moral equivalency enters the picture, and we're left to distinguish between bad and less bad. It doesn't make for a hopeful situation.That's the sort of picture ""La Haine"" is. Translated, it means 'Hate', and that emotion is palpable throughout the story of three young men with no direction, no job, and nothing to do with themselves except kill time by hanging around in one section of the city or another. Being a French film, the city in this case is Paris, but not the Paris one sees in travel brochures. This story is set in an area of depressing housing projects where the chances of upward mobility doesn't exist, exacerbated by tensions between the police and a diverse population trying to make ends meet.The film is book-ended by an idea submitted as a conversation about a person falling from a high rise window. All the way down, the soon to be deceased person maintains a momentary positive attitude by repeating to himself, 'so far so good', with a corollary offered by the listener that 'it's not how you fall that matters, it's how you land'. This would appear to be good advice for the three principal characters, Said, Vinz and Hubert if they only had the temperament to look at their lives objectively and realize that no one was going to come to their rescue as victims of the projects. That they would have to do for themselves. But with those whose inner rage has ratcheted up to a boiling point, an inevitable hard landing is virtually assured.I thought this was a good film for what it was, even though it doesn't try to provide any answers. The answers, as most rational people know, lie within one's self, and there are many real life examples one can point to of people digging themselves out of a hole to become worthwhile and productive citizens. Unfortunately, many never figure it out, and 'so far, so good' almost never lasts.",its not how you fall that matters its how you land,after watching this film i reflected back whole host films ive seen produced by warner brothers back forties fifties having do with subject poverty how that can lead crime lost lives lot cases civic moral dilemmas could often be resolved with right winning out over wrong end todays world right often comes up empty handed often theres fine line between differentiating good bad many cases moral equivalency enters picture were left distinguish between bad less bad it doesnt make hopeful situation thats sort picture la haine is translated it means hate that emotion is palpable throughout story three young men with no direction no job nothing do with themselves except kill time by hanging around one section city or another being french film city this case is paris but not paris one sees travel brochures this story is set area depressing housing projects where chances upward mobility doesnt exist exacerbated by tensions between police diverse population trying make ends meet film is book ended by idea submitted as conversation about person falling high rise window all way down soon be deceased person maintains momentary positive attitude by repeating himself so far so good with corollary offered by listener that its not how you fall that matters its how you land this would appear be good advice three principal characters said vinz hubert if they only had temperament look at their lives objectively realize that no one was going come their rescue as victims projects that they would have do themselves but with those whose inner rage has ratcheted up boiling point inevitable hard landing is virtually assured i thought this was good film what it was even though it doesnt try provide any answers answers as most rational people know lie within ones self there are many real life examples one can point people digging themselves out hole become worthwhile productive citizens unfortunately many never figure it out so far so good almost never lasts,0.5047466357931474,0.08592586999563745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,Great achievement. One of the most unforgettable Euro movies of the 90's.,"La Haine aka Hate is a story about three friends living near Paris in France (one Jew, one Arab and one black) who have nothing special in their lives and try to live a day at a time by drinking and having a good time and also working (at least the black character, who owns a boxing hall). Their friend, however, is captured by a police which tortures and maltreats him so badly that he is sent to a hospital in a critical condition. This makes the youth gangs in city including the three protagonists start a war against the police and authorities for the horrible wrongs they and their friend have suffered, and suddenly they notice the whole society is collapsing, and all there is is hate and need to revenge...Violence and mayhem is almost everywhere, including authorities which should do nothing but fight against it..This film is powerful and grim. Totally unforgettable is the last scene which at my first viewing time blew me away. It comes very suddenly and there are no warnings what will happen at the end of this film. The message is so important and these marks of the ""apocalypse"" can be found in our everyday life everywhere. The society is falling and it is ""spinning"" as the voice over says just before the end credits..The film brings into question such horrific facts as racism which should have passed away long times ago, but no. Racism is such a primitive, stupid and despisable cancer among people, that there is no hope of better future if individuals don't understand the real facts of life and right ways to live with each other. Hate feeds hate as the character Hubert says, and that is something that our stupid race has not learned.There is one very powerful scene just before the end scene and it deals with a skinhead and these three characters who could kill him right away and pay something back. It is very challenging scene and even Vinz, the most revenge seeking character, starts to see things different way after that. The whole point of La Haine is violence in all its forms. Why there is violence and why the hell it is used so often everywhere in every form? Don't we ever learn? These kind of films are important and so powerful that unfortunately people who should see them don't want to or they can't bacause it would be as a mirror for them..The film is also a comment on power used by police as they are pretty tough and hard in this film. Police think that they can use any methods in order to get some answers, or in order to have some fun..It certainly doesn't judge police as ""pigs"" or violent sadists in general, but it is a warning example of what must NOT happen anywhere ever, by police or by others. One has to see through the film and to its core in order to understand what it says. Otherwise there is no point in watching these kind of films. La Haine is that kind of a film that it should be seen by police and youths as well, because there are still possibilities to prevent things to go too far in our life and world we live in.The camera techniques used in this film are magnificent. Director/screenwriter Mathieu Kassovitz uses camera so smoothly and passionately and there are many similarities in techniques between this film and his more recent, Assassin(s). I am very happy for this young talent to have won the director's award at Cannes. These kind of talents deserve their prizes because there are so many stupid and worthless films which don't have nothing artistic in them and have nothing to say, and are just mindless and greedy entertainment. The black and white is very great element and the film strikes greatly without colors. The same case is with the Belgian classic Man Bites Dog, by Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde and Andre Bonzel. A great masterpiece in French modern cinema and recommended for the fans of intelligent and important cinema so seldom found from big studios or Hollywood (there are exceptions, of course) nowadays.10/10",great achievement one most unforgettable euro movies 90s,la haine aka hate is story about three friends living near paris france one jew one arab one black who have nothing special their lives try live day at time by drinking having good time also working at least black character who owns boxing hall their friend however is captured by police which tortures maltreats him so badly that he is sent hospital critical condition this makes youth gangs city including three protagonists start war against police authorities horrible wrongs they their friend have suffered suddenly they notice whole society is collapsing all there is is hate need revenge violence mayhem is almost everywhere including authorities which should do nothing but fight against it this film is powerful grim totally unforgettable is last scene which at my first viewing time blew me away it comes very suddenly there are no warnings what will happen at end this film message is so important these marks apocalypse can be found our everyday life everywhere society is falling it is spinning as voice over says just before end credits film brings into question such horrific facts as racism which should have passed away long times ago but no racism is such primitive stupid despisable cancer among people that there is no hope better future if individuals dont understand real facts life right ways live with each other hate feeds hate as character hubert says that is something that our stupid race has not learned there is one very powerful scene just before end scene it deals with skinhead these three characters who could kill him right away pay something back it is very challenging scene even vinz most revenge seeking character starts see things different way after that whole point la haine is violence all its forms why there is violence why hell it is used so often everywhere every form dont we ever learn these kind films are important so powerful that unfortunately people who should see them dont want or they cant bacause it would be as mirror them film is also comment power used by police as they are pretty tough hard this film police think that they can use any methods order get some answers or order have some fun it certainly doesnt judge police as pigs or violent sadists general but it is warning example what must not happen anywhere ever by police or by others one has see through film its core order understand what it says otherwise there is no point watching these kind films la haine is that kind film that it should be seen by police youths as well because there are still possibilities prevent things go too far our life world we live camera techniques used this film are magnificent director screenwriter mathieu kassovitz uses camera so smoothly passionately there are many similarities techniques between this film his more recent assassin s i am very happy this young talent have won directors award at cannes these kind talents deserve their prizes because there are so many stupid worthless films which dont have nothing artistic them have nothing say are just mindless greedy entertainment black white is very great element film strikes greatly without colors same case is with belgian classic man bites dog by remy belvaux benoit poelvoorde andre bonzel great masterpiece french modern cinema recommended fans intelligent important cinema so seldom found big studios or hollywood there are exceptions course nowadays 10 10,0.6514258028792911,0.0841440987952616,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,the most important thing isn't the fall but the landing,"""La Haine"", probably one of the most momentous French movies of the nineties caused a stir when it opened in 1995 so much so that it became a big social phenomenon. It heralded a genre: the ""film De Banlieue"" whose backdrop is high-risk French suburbs and in its wake, other movies emerged like ""Bye-Bye"" (1995) or ""ma 6-T Va Crack-Er"" (1997). ""La Haine"" remains Mathieu Kassovitz's best moment. Afterwards, he didn't cease to disappoint me. ""Assassin(s)"" (1997) left me uncomfortable and queasy and ""les Rivières Pourpres"" (2000) was an absolute turkey. I haven't seen ""Gothika"" (2003) but he shot it with the Hollywood presence on his back and I fear the worst.To better be immersed in his plan, Kassovitz shot his film in one of these high-risk French suburbs (I can't remember its name but you can check it in the ""filming locations"" rubric when you arrive on the page of the film on this site). This gives his movie an ultra-realist sensation which rings true. In the space of a day, his camera follows a threesome of ruffians. There's Vinz (Vincent Cassel) who acts the tough guy. He is proud of having stolen the gun of a cop and hopes to make good use of it. When he is asked to make an effort of reflection, he loses his temper. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) a pacifist who craves to get out of this daily hell but where to go? He also knows that hate breeds hate. It's both the catalyst of the riots and adds fuel to the fire in the incessant conflicts. And also Saïd (Saïd Thagmaouï), a brazen teenager. The three of them wander in their neighborhood and in Paris between visiting of friends, relationships with the riffraff, the police, arguments, reconciliations and foolish things. An ordinary day during which the trio appears as prisoners of their suburbs and have a life with no horizon. A day which will lead to the inevitable, marked out by the time which often appears on a black screen.Kassovitz did his best to create a stylish film and it paid off well. It was a good idea to have shot his film in a black and white cinematography because it bestows it with a very gritty aura; sometimes there's a documentary whiff which pervades the film. His camera work which commands admiration makes juxtapose travelings, static shots and circular movements according to the vibe a sequence could convey. It also helps to enhance the scenery which is perhaps the fourth main actor of the film after the trio. Overrall, his film is a hard-hitting assessment of a faltering universe (the high-risk suburbs) in which latent tensions and hate reign and it can awake at any time in violence. This hate in question which the inhabitants of these suburbs feel towards the cops is also smoldered in the cops and I wonder if Kassovitz indicts their sometimes intolerable demeanor, especially when some ruffians are kept in police custody. In the beginning of the film, the audience learns that a suspect, Abdel is in a coma at hospital because he was badly injured by the cops during questioning. When they learned this, the toughest guys of these suburbs sparked off a riot. In a way, the attitude of the police helps to fuel the hate and to separate farther the gap and the incomprehension between the inhabitants of these suburbs and the police. That said, Kassovitz doesn't generalize. Not all the cops are monstrous. Check the two sequences when in the first one, a policeman tries to make the riffraff understand in a sensible manner that they can't stay on the roof of a building and the second sequence when Vinz, Hubert and Saïd are in Paris and they ask their way to a policeman who guides them in a polite way.The actors were discerningly chosen and perfectly directed. It seems that Kassovitz fostered improvisation. It was the right method to confer his film with an authentic feeling. They deliver dialogs full of slang, coarse lines and sometimes they're inaudible so you'll have to be very attentive to catch what they say. However, this drawback isn't really irritating and was surely wanted by the director to reinforce the unique spontaneity of the film. With his build and his face of ruffian, Vincent Cassel was ideally cast as the stubborn Vinz while his two main partners are amazingly true to life. And there are some famous French actors who have cameos and who weren't afraid of having demeaning parts like Vincent Lindon, a drunkard or Zinedine Soualem, a sadistic cop.Kassovitz remains as objective as possible and doesn't offer solutions to solve these problems. More than ten years after it reached the streets, his films is still a topical one and the riots and violent incidents which broke out in high-risk suburbs in many French cities the last fall alas show that these tensions aren't alas ready to subside.",most important thing isnt fall but landing,la haine probably one most momentous french movies nineties caused stir when it opened 1995 so much so that it became big social phenomenon it heralded genre film de banlieue whose backdrop is high risk french suburbs its wake other movies emerged like bye bye 1995 or ma 6 t va crack er 1997 la haine remains mathieu kassovitzs best moment afterwards he didnt cease disappoint me assassin s 1997 left me uncomfortable queasy les rivi res pourpres 2000 was absolute turkey i havent seen gothika 2003 but he shot it with hollywood presence his back i fear worst better be immersed his plan kassovitz shot his film one these high risk french suburbs i cant remember its name but you can check it filming locations rubric when you arrive page film this site this gives his movie ultra realist sensation which rings true space day his camera follows threesome ruffians theres vinz vincent cassel who acts tough guy he is proud having stolen gun cop hopes make good use it when he is asked make effort reflection he loses his temper hubert hubert kound pacifist who craves get out this daily hell but where go he also knows that hate breeds hate its both catalyst riots adds fuel fire incessant conflicts also sa d sa d thagmaou brazen teenager three them wander their neighborhood paris between visiting friends relationships with riffraff police arguments reconciliations foolish things ordinary day during which trio appears as prisoners their suburbs have life with no horizon day which will lead inevitable marked out by time which often appears black screen kassovitz did his best create stylish film it paid off well it was good idea have shot his film black white cinematography because it bestows it with very gritty aura sometimes theres documentary whiff which pervades film his camera work which commands admiration makes juxtapose travelings static shots circular movements according vibe sequence could convey it also helps enhance scenery which is perhaps fourth main actor film after trio overrall his film is hard hitting assessment faltering universe high risk suburbs which latent tensions hate reign it can awake at any time violence this hate question which inhabitants these suburbs feel towards cops is also smoldered cops i wonder if kassovitz indicts their sometimes intolerable demeanor especially when some ruffians are kept police custody beginning film audience learns that suspect abdel is coma at hospital because he was badly injured by cops during questioning when they learned this toughest guys these suburbs sparked off riot way attitude police helps fuel hate separate farther gap incomprehension between inhabitants these suburbs police that said kassovitz doesnt generalize not all cops are monstrous check two sequences when first one policeman tries make riffraff understand sensible manner that they cant stay roof building second sequence when vinz hubert sa d are paris they ask their way policeman who guides them polite way actors were discerningly chosen perfectly directed it seems that kassovitz fostered improvisation it was right method confer his film with authentic feeling they deliver dialogs full slang coarse lines sometimes theyre inaudible so youll have be very attentive catch what they say however this drawback isnt really irritating was surely wanted by director reinforce unique spontaneity film with his build his face ruffian vincent cassel was ideally cast as stubborn vinz while his two main partners are amazingly true life there are some famous french actors who have cameos who werent afraid having demeaning parts like vincent lindon drunkard or zinedine soualem sadistic cop kassovitz remains as objective as possible doesnt offer solutions solve these problems more than ten years after it reached streets his films is still topical one riots violent incidents which broke out high risk suburbs many french cities last fall alas show that these tensions arent alas ready subside,0.5365783730158731,0.06248115079365081,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,"""La Haine""; Mathieu Kassovitz' stark social study of violence, fear and hatred, remains the powerful masterpiece it was in '95.","In 1995, Mathieu Kassovitz wrote and directed a film that showed the controversial truth; ""La Haine"", which translates to ""Hate"", a film deemed so important the then-prime minister Alain Juppé arranged a special screening and ordered his entire cabinet to watch the film. Kassovitz rightfully won the Best Director award at the Cannes festival for his film that had and still has a huge impact on French society. La Haine mixes ethnics to emphasise the overriding importance of solidarity against the police. In my opinion, the greatest film ever made. A cinematic phenomenon so close to my heart.It is the day after the riots on an underclass French estate (the film opens with real footage of riots with the suitable soundtrack of Bob Marley's Burnin' and Lootin'). A youth named Abdel had been caught and beaten by the police and is now in critical condition. One of his very best friends, Vinz (Jewish), had found a cop's weapon. He swears that if Abdel dies he will kill a cop. The majority of the film revolves around Vinz and his two other friends Hubert (Afro-Caribbean) and Saïd (North African) roaming around their ghetto and suburbs of Paris. Set just within 24 hours, this is just a glimpse of the chaos.There is an image in La Haine where Vinz (Vincent Cassel) imitates Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) in the mirror; ""You talking' to me?"" and then points his fingers like a gun and fires. This is not an action he only does once as he repeats it twice during the film. But why? He has a gun. Is this preparation? Yes. Vinz has to prepare because he is scared. And he has to see what it looks like, to make sure it looks ""cool"", as when he does kill a cop, he will get an undeserved respect by his peers. There is another scene in which Vinz and Hubert bump into a cop while trying to run from this. Vinz' first instinct is to pull the gun on him, this shows that the first instinct has now become violence. The reaction to violence is fear (which is apparent in the cops face until Hubert knocks him out). Fear creates hate; or, the thought and idea of hate. Like the youths feel they are supposed to hate the cops. Vinz is the angriest central character, but when he had his chance, he hesitates; consequences are not forgotten. Cassel performs Vinz with brute force, not failing to portray his character for a second.Hubert (Hubert Koundé), the most subtle character in the film, remains quiet and gentle, although he is a boxer; or a fighter; for the majority of the film. He has a longing to escape. He has no idea who to trust. Everyone is a thug. This is the stereotype that has been created. But not even a thug wants this thought about them. He is always watching the hatred breed around him but never takes part. But when it comes to the cut, the action and reaction is always the same and he proves himself wrong. Koundé put a lot of effort into his role and earns his praise.Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui); possibly the most vibrant character of the three, feels as if he has to be something, he hates change but he follows the crowd, he wants to be accepted. He appears to be everybody's friend as he constantly makes jokes. This is because his family is dead so Vinz and Hubert; and possibly Abdel but we don't know since we only ever hear about Abdel, so they are basically his family. But if they get into trouble they wouldn't hesitate to leave each other. It's every man for himself. Cassel, Koundé and Taghmaoui work so well together its as if they have known each other for years.The youths are stuck on the idea that the cops are there to stop them, and they refuse the idea that the cops are there in fact to protect them. And the youths express hatred with violence. Sexual intercourse is not an issue in this society as it is too dangerous to have a girlfriend, as it will spawn more violence, thus more hatred. La Haine does not offer solutions to all the racism but in fact, shows you in a detailed and mature manner.Starkly shot in black and white; La Haine has one of my favourite cinematography works. Kassovitz directional style is so inspirational, using rocketing zooms and smooth swerves to get the full view of the destruction. Popular hip hop music is used and heard throughout the film, none of it I would listen to unless I was watching La Haine. The film shows a side of France you can not find on a tourist map. Passion, dedication and effort was well put forward to La Haine. It punches you in the face with its sheer, raw intensity.The films most important quote is the one it opens and shuts with: - ""Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper?

10.0,Circle of ... hate,"This was released 25 years ago, but still feels relevant. Especially with what is going on in America (once again), with the killing of George Floyd. Now the movie does not concentrate on Black Lives Matter (the movement did not exist back then), but focuses on police brutality, a seemlingless inescapable path french youth in certain areas was facing (probably still are facing).The perfomances are quite stunning and while we do have the youth we concentrate on, there are some diverse views on how to act or where to go. The youth, the characters we follow are prisoners ... they are what society and circumstances made them. There are cultural references to movies for exmaple, be it Scarface ""World is yours"", Taxi Driver ""talking to me"" to name but two. The latter is not quoted correctly if the french translation of what is being said is to be believed. But that makes it better, many missquote movies or make them their own. Vincent Cassel is not spoofing De Niro, he makes it a short but powerful moment in the movie.And that is just the beginning. The three friends, different but yet with a core feeling of being sidelined, of not being heard, of being minimalized, is quite intriguing. You feel for them and yet it is very likely you will hate some of their actions. Instead of cancelling them though, how could we help them? The movie does not suggest solutions in that regard.

It's rare that a film like this is considered both genuine and a good example of it's art but La Haine is both.The plotline is compelling and realistic and neatly shows the way that inner city life has gone in the big cities in France as well as proving that despite the romance of Paris, it suffers from the same problems as any other major city.The characters are above all believable and the cast did a great job. The quality of acting is simply stunning from several actors and it would be a shame if it was simply dismissed as ""just another foreign art-house movie"" by audiences outside France.Above all the film whilst showing the influences of American films and society has a very clear sense of it's own identity and at no time does it feel like another US Ghetto film transposed to France. This is a major boon to the film and it stands out of the crowd for this, even though many people will dislike it because of this.

10.0,this concerns everyone,"Moviemakers when filming French based films have traditionally tended to sentimentalise the people' through the celebration of les petits gens, the little people of Pagnol and Clair as well as more recently the fantastical Parisian wonderland environments of Amelie and Moulin Rouge. With La Haine, young director Mathieu Kassovitz took the flipside of this and gave an illustration of the awfulness of life in the depressed blue-collar areas of ParisLa Haine (Hate') begins after a night of rioting on a dismal housing estate on the northern outskirts of Paris and focuses on 24 hours in the lives of three close friends aged around 20. They are Vince (Vincent Cassel), an explosive working-class Jew, Hubert (Hubert Kounde), a handsome, soft-spoken black, and Said (Said Taghmaoui), a mercurial streetwise Arab. With little hopes or prospect of regular employment due to where they come from, the trio drift aimlessly, engaging in petty theft, and seething with aggressive resentment against an uncaring world. L'Avenir c'est nous (We Are the Future) is the ironic slogan on the estate's playground, but this is a film about people who believe they have no future.The quality of the performances from the 3 main actors, their conviction, the way they interact with one another and the vigour and fluency of Kassovitz's script and direction make this a very special movie indeed. Its full of action, detail, unexpected incidents and quirky humour. For instance, the boys have a bizarre encounter in a public lavatory in central Paris with a diminutive survivor of the Gulag that is as puzzling to them as it is to us. Does the story the Gulag survivor tells them have a deeper meaning than on the surface? Of course it does, and importantly this film makes you think as to what the metaphor means. Throughout violence is always on the point of erupting. There are constant confrontations with a brutal, racist police force, and Vince has a 44 Magnum revolver that a plainclothes cop lost during the riots, which we know will eventually be used on someone. However none of this ever descends into mere gratuitous violence like so many Hollywood filmsLa Haine presents a state of affairs of the alienation faced by many young people in the projects' in France, and all over the world. It doesn't offer any solutions, though the point is forcibly made that in France, as elsewhere, parts of the police force are part of the problem rather than the solution. Of course, much of what we are shown is familiar to us from British and American films .The strength of the film is that it neither glamorises nor patronises its characters. They hate their life because it's boring, and they despise the society that's created it for them, together with parks, football fields and a few mod cons with which to comfort them. In particular, they hate the police, who hate them right back. The film's other major achievement is to show in a tangible and very expressive way how a cycle of distrust and anger is created on both sides of this awful divide, so that there is very little anyone can do about it. In other words violence and hate breeds more violence and hate.A criticism that could be levelled is that in the US / UK versions the sub-titles don't help, pushing what is very authentic dialogue into something more like cliché, as well as pointless miss-translations that occur. However this is just a minor thing, and does not and should not reflect at all on the film itself.This certainly is one of the greatest films of the 1990s. Its one of those rare films that you will think about for the days and weeks after  not solely about the film itself, but on wider issues such as society, poverty and racism.",this concerns everyone,moviemakers when filming french based films have traditionally tended sentimentalise people through celebration les petits gens little people pagnol clair as well as more recently fantastical parisian wonderland environments amelie moulin rouge with la haine young director mathieu kassovitz took flipside this gave illustration awfulness life depressed blue collar areas parisla haine hate begins after night rioting dismal housing estate northern outskirts paris focuses 24 hours lives three close friends aged around 20 they are vince vincent cassel explosive working class jew hubert hubert kounde handsome soft spoken black said said taghmaoui mercurial streetwise arab with little hopes or prospect regular employment due where they come trio drift aimlessly engaging petty theft seething with aggressive resentment against uncaring world lavenir cest nous we are future is ironic slogan estates playground but this is film about people who believe they have no future quality performances 3 main actors their conviction way they interact with one another vigour fluency kassovitzs script direction make this very special movie indeed its full action detail unexpected incidents quirky humour instance boys have bizarre encounter public lavatory central paris with diminutive survivor gulag that is as puzzling them as it is us does story gulag survivor tells them have deeper meaning than surface course it does importantly this film makes you think as what metaphor means throughout violence is always point erupting there are constant confrontations with brutal racist police force vince has 44 magnum revolver that plainclothes cop lost during riots which we know will eventually be used someone however none this ever descends into mere gratuitous violence like so many hollywood filmsla haine presents state affairs alienation faced by many young people projects france all over world it doesnt offer any solutions though point is forcibly made that france as elsewhere parts police force are part problem rather than solution course much what we are shown is familiar us british american films strength film is that it neither glamorises nor patronises its characters they hate their life because its boring they despise society thats created it them together with parks football fields few mod cons with which comfort them particular they hate police who hate them right back films other major achievement is show tangible very expressive way how cycle distrust anger is created both sides this awful divide so that there is very little anyone can do about it other words violence hate breeds more violence hate criticism that could be levelled is that us uk versions sub titles dont help pushing what is very authentic dialogue into something more like clich as well as pointless miss translations that occur however this is just minor thing does not should not reflect at all film itself this certainly is one greatest films 1990s its one those rare films that you will think about days weeks after not solely about film itself but wider issues such as society poverty racism,0.5354449472096529,-0.0044161414565826295,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.3}"

I never thought a film could actually make you truly think about things around our world, not just how bad it can be in places like the projects set in the film. I could truly see this happening where I am from(Rochdale,Manchester,UK).The situation set in the film is a dark and nasty one. you watch 3 friends fall apart from the aftermath of a riot in a parisian project.a friend is near-fatally injured in police custody, which sparks a chain of events, part forced onto the 3 friends, part of self-inflicted.the acting is amazing.

His problem is he can't see the wood for the trees, which Hubert tries to point out to him.Hubert is a character who has the potential to better his life, but he is trapped in his parisian project cell. he tries to guide vinz to a healthier and more productive way of thinking about life.said seems to be the one who doesn't want trouble, but it is thrust upon him. he sees the relationship between hubert and vinz, his 2 best friend, deteriorate, but doesn't know who to side with, or what to do about it.Mathieu Kassovitz made this film in a way that you feel for both the police and the the 3 friends. It is amazing to watch, as mathieu takes the simplest things, and makes them look classy(check out the DJ scene for a true example of what I mean). he uses black and white as to colour, and it doesn't look fake, or cheesy. in fact it enhances the film more than you could imagine. you won't sit there and wish he filmed it in colour by the end. the action, although relatively mild compared to todays film, is believable.speaking about the end, it is one of the most simplest and powerful endings I have seen in a film yet. the soundtrack is awesome too. who would have thought french hip-hop would sound so sweet.",how can you sum up film this beautiful slick,i first saw this film 1997 after seeing reading reviews about it tv net couple years i never thought film could actually make you truly think about things around our world not just how bad it can be places like projects set film i could truly see this happening where i am rochdale manchester uk situation set film is dark nasty one you watch 3 friends fall apart aftermath riot parisian project friend is near fatally injured police custody which sparks chain events part forced onto 3 friends part self inflicted acting is amazing vincent cassels performance is electrifying his mentality is distorted with hate hence film name but you truly feel he is not bad seed his problem is he cant see wood trees which hubert tries point out him hubert is character who has potential better his life but he is trapped his parisian project cell he tries guide vinz healthier more productive way thinking about life said seems be one who doesnt want trouble but it is thrust upon him he sees relationship between hubert vinz his 2 best friend deteriorate but doesnt know who side with or what do about it mathieu kassovitz made this film way that you feel both police 3 friends it is amazing watch as mathieu takes simplest things makes them look classy check out dj scene true example what i mean he uses black white as colour it doesnt look fake or cheesy fact it enhances film more than you could imagine you wont sit there wish he filmed it colour by end action although relatively mild compared todays film is believable speaking about end it is one most simplest powerful endings i have seen film yet soundtrack is awesome too who would have thought french hip hop would sound so sweet,0.5240625000000001,0.09760416666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.32}"
6.0,The French's answer to Spike Lee,"""Hate"" is one of the two movies that have been recommended to me the most (the other, if you care, is Sansho the Bailiff). Criterion's recently release of it in region 1 finally allowed me to see it, and though it's well made and decently enough written, I can't say I'm a huge fan.""Hate"" is the French answer to Spike Lee, right down to the floaty camera and the constant emphasis on racial tension. It starts on a riot, then introduces three friends (one Arab, one Jew, and one black) the next day, then goes to a party where someone says, ""Did you hear about the pig (cop) that lost his gun last night?"", and from there the entire movie is spelled out to anyone familiar with this type of story.This movie is a social commentary on racism, class warfare, and ""hateful"" mentality, and it doesn't add much new to the mix except a cow (symbol of the character's misdirection) and a joke/theme about a man falling several stories to his death. The rest of it--the strange old man with the anecdote in the bathroom, the tracing of the gun as it changes hands but persists in remaining with the friends, the music, and the drawing up of the characters--are all tropes of what is becoming something of a recognizable sub-sub-genre within the already known ""Urban Drama"" sub-genre. And, like all those other films, this film isn't really interested as much in providing answers or clues as to what to do about humanity's tendency to hate as it is more interested in waxing poetic over it.Not to say it's that bad of a movie, and technically the world can use a thousand movies like it until people finally get the point.

,Slightly disappointing look at France's desperate underclass.,"I feel bad that I wasn't as knocked out by this movie as much as most other viewers, but I must give an honest reaction. 'La Haine' looks at roughly twenty four hours in the lives of three young friends of various ethnic backgrounds who live in the suburbs of Paris. It is the morning after a riot and tensions run high. A buddy of theirs is in hospital after a police beating, and one of them (Vincent Cassel, 'Dobermann') the volatile Viz finds a cops gun. His mates are the more level headed boxer Hubert (Hubert Kounde) and the charming rogue Said (Said Taghmaoui, 'Three Kings'). This is a gritty, depressing and presumably realistic look at France's desperate underclass. The three leads are all very good. Cassel is a major star in France ('The Brotherhood Of The Wolf',etc.) but the real stand out for me is the charismatic Taghmaoui, who after this and a memorable role in 'Three Kings' has the potential to be an international success. 'La Haine's heart is in the right place and the ending is powerful and unexpected, but overall I felt it seemed overly familiar and a bit too shallow. Even so it's a movie worth watching despite having almost unreadable subtitles on the video version I saw.

10.0,best film of its year; pure urban horror filmed in unflinching and poetic eyes,"Matthieu Kassovitz shot out a wad, so to speak, of the kind of ""issue"" movie that had brawn and balls and didn't back down from showing the truth on all sides, and how it's all ultimately ugly and screams for change to happen. How much the film might have changed things in the ghettos of Paris I'm not sure, and possibly it didn't do much. But as an act of cinematic awareness to a grim situation with bravura drama and humor and in the guise of a ""youth"" movie, it's completely captivating. What's strong about it is not just that Kassovitz wont turn away from the cyclical nature of violence between the young citizens brutalized and the cops 'battling' them back causing the ensuing riots, but that nobody is shown as being really right or wrong... Maybe that's not entirely true; La Haine was made for a purpose, through visionary direction and outstanding performances, which is to shed light on something that without any awareness would go on unabated. It's basically like Mean Streets meets Battle of Algiers, if that makes sense.Maybe the latter of those examples is a little extreme an example since it's a wider framework of history and terrorism, whereas this is a work about the little horrors with those who cross the wrong path with the wrong cops in heightened racial and ethnic tension, and is intense on a slightly different level. But it also is relentless in its pursuit of truth at the matter, or rather the filmmaker's heightened and suspenseful level of truth, and it hits the viewer like a gun across the cheeks. While at the same time this societal statement is made there's a real story going on about three young friends (Vincent Cassell, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaoui, all named with their characters), one of which carrying a gun he 'found' from one cop who lost it during a riot, and their travels and adventures over a day trying to get money, drugs, or just getting by the haze of bewilderment over their friend dying in a hospital from cops beating and Vinz's demand for revenge *if* he dies.La Haine is an impression of just a part of a city, as much as one can grab in a day's length of time in 'movie-time', but as well as comparisons to Mean Streets may lie there's also one perhaps for Do the Right Thing. Kassovitz isn't afraid to take a current event and turn it into the stuff of rousing character-driven drama with some semblance of plot (in this case the old 'if the gun is used in act then one act five' logic), but like Lee or Scorsese his black and white cinematography that follows these guys around with the verve to keep on a tracking shot or a specific close-up (in a half-ironic close-up Cassel talks to the mirror ala Travis Bickle, a little inspired through a whole other perspective) that speaks so much. And sometimes he'll put a strange but perfect detour in the structure, like the old man telling the story in the bathroom, or the sudden break for break dancing, or that one shot flying across the air from the window of the DJ. Sometimes it's docu-realistic, but then Kassovitz will throw that stylistic curve-ball reminding us this is in-your-face and with an attitude that would make the Clash raise an eyebrow or two.And along with Kassovitz hitting it way out of the park intellectually and emotionally as a filmmaker, his actors are all lock-in-step wonderful for their characters: Taghmaoui, who you might remember from Three Kings or Traitor, as the uppity and bad-joke telling Arab who has attitude to spare but is like a rough puppy at best; Kounde as the one with probably the most common sense as a guy who lost his gym to the riot and gets by smoking hash and trying to get (or talk) Cassel out of trouble; Cassel as the hot-head with something to prove to himself, or so he thinks, carrying the gun and not really knowing its implications. The three of them are not really very bad kids, but they're from the streets and know it well and know what they need to do to act right and behave around amid what is at points squalor (i.e. the subway bit with one after another homeless folks going by) and just rough gang stuff.They're even sensitive performances to a degree, which is important since La Haine, for all its toughness and rigor and occasional blasts of harsh violence, is a beautiful work of a Frenchman who knows what he's doing. It's made by the young and for the young, but it's also made for anyone looking for an example of what is both important and entertaining art after the French new-wave has come and gone. And, as with any great post-modern film, seeing it once isn't enough.",best film its year pure urban horror filmed unflinching poetic eyes,matthieu kassovitz shot out wad so speak kind issue movie that had brawn balls didnt back down showing truth all sides how its all ultimately ugly screams change happen how much film might have changed things ghettos paris im not sure possibly it didnt do much but as act cinematic awareness grim situation with bravura drama humor guise youth movie its completely captivating whats strong about it is not just that kassovitz wont turn away cyclical nature violence between young citizens brutalized cops battling them back causing ensuing riots but that nobody is shown as being really right or wrong maybe thats not entirely true la haine was made purpose through visionary direction outstanding performances which is shed light something that without any awareness would go unabated its basically like mean streets meets battle algiers if that makes sense maybe latter those examples is little extreme example since its wider framework history terrorism whereas this is work about little horrors with those who cross wrong path with wrong cops heightened racial ethnic tension is intense slightly different level but it also is relentless its pursuit truth at matter or rather filmmakers heightened suspenseful level truth it hits viewer like gun across cheeks while at same time this societal statement is made theres real story going about three young friends vincent cassell hubert kounde said taghmaoui all named with their characters one which carrying gun he found one cop who lost it during riot their travels adventures over day trying get money drugs or just getting by haze bewilderment over their friend dying hospital cops beating vinzs demand revenge if he dies la haine is impression just part city as much as one can grab days length time movie time but as well as comparisons mean streets may lie theres also one perhaps do right thing kassovitz isnt afraid take current event turn it into stuff rousing character driven drama with some semblance plot this case old if gun is used act then one act five logic but like lee or scorsese his black white cinematography that follows these guys around with verve keep tracking shot or specific close up half ironic close up cassel talks mirror ala travis bickle little inspired through whole other perspective that speaks so much sometimes hell put strange but perfect detour structure like old man telling story bathroom or sudden break break dancing or that one shot flying across air window dj sometimes its docu realistic but then kassovitz will throw that stylistic curve ball reminding us this is your face with attitude that would make clash raise eyebrow or two along with kassovitz hitting it way out park intellectually emotionally as filmmaker his actors are all lock step wonderful their characters taghmaoui who you might remember three kings or traitor as uppity bad joke telling arab who has attitude spare but is like rough puppy at best kounde as one with probably most common sense as guy who lost his gym riot gets by smoking hash trying get or talk cassel out trouble cassel as hot head with something prove himself or so he thinks carrying gun not really knowing its implications three them are not really very bad kids but theyre streets know it well know what they need do act right behave around amid what is at points squalor i e subway bit with one after another homeless folks going by just rough gang stuff theyre even sensitive performances degree which is important since la haine all its toughness rigor occasional blasts harsh violence is beautiful work frenchman who knows what hes doing its made by young young but its also made anyone looking example what is both important entertaining art after french new wave has come gone as with any great post modern film seeing it once isnt enough,0.5290412629698343,0.08257622998694426,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!,"La haine is written and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. It stars Vincent Cassel, Hubert Koundé and Saïd Taghmaoui. Original music is by Assassin and cinematography by Pierre Aïm. When a local youth is beaten unconscious by the police, a riot ensues on his Parisian estate during which a policeman loses his gun. As tensions rise, the gun is found by Vinz (Cassel) who proclaims that he will kill a cop if the beaten youth dies.This is not Paris, surely? Where's all the beloved tourist sites and bohemian streets? Of course some way away from this Parisian suburb Paris thrives, but this is a real place, real heat and real hate. Shot in striking black and white, using firebrand young actors and giving them urban wit, angst and aggression, Kassovitz serves up a powder-keg of a movie. It's a portrait of a multiracial community thrust together by one act of police aggression, but the underlying themes of boredom, prejudice and the escalation of hate drip from every tension fuelled frame. The youth characterisations are rich and intelligently drawn (wonderfully performed by the three principals), but the outer edged characters impact greatly as well, even in the most unusual of places like a gents toilet. Layered over the top of it all is a vibrant rap and reggae soundtrack; perfect. Thematically we have seen it all before in cinema, in fact this feels like a composite of Spike Lee, Larry Clark, Martin Scorsese, John Singleton and Alan Clarke films, but it's still very much its own animal, a French concrete jungle where the heat is piercing but the sun can't be seen. As riots continue to blight parts of the world, La haine is still relevant and still packing a punch today. Incendary and grim for sure, but riveting and essential in the pantheon of urban decay cinema. 9/10",how you fall doesnt matter its how you land,la haine is written directed by mathieu kassovitz it stars vincent cassel hubert kound sa d taghmaoui original music is by assassin cinematography by pierre m when local youth is beaten unconscious by police riot ensues his parisian estate during which policeman loses his gun as tensions rise gun is found by vinz cassel who proclaims that he will kill cop if beaten youth dies this is not paris surely wheres all beloved tourist sites bohemian streets course some way away this parisian suburb paris thrives but this is real place real heat real hate shot striking black white using firebrand young actors giving them urban wit angst aggression kassovitz serves up powder keg movie its portrait multiracial community thrust together by one act police aggression but underlying themes boredom prejudice escalation hate drip every tension fuelled frame youth characterisations are rich intelligently drawn wonderfully performed by three principals but outer edged characters impact greatly as well even most unusual places like gents toilet layered over top it all is vibrant rap reggae soundtrack perfect thematically we have seen it all before cinema fact this feels like composite spike lee larry clark martin scorsese john singleton alan clarke films but its still very much its own animal french concrete jungle where heat is piercing but sun cant be seen as riots continue blight parts world la haine is still relevant still packing punch today incendary grim sure but riveting essential pantheon urban decay cinema 9 10,0.5721895424836603,0.2066666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,A heartfelt and relevant tale of injustice and humanity,"An incendiary independent black and white offering from France that has managed to remain relevant and oft spoken about these 25 plus years on from initial release, Mathieu Kassovitz's personal and heartfelt La Haine (simply meaning The Hate) is a memorable exploration of social injustice and simmering tensions and a feat its filmmaker will always struggle too top.Following up his work here with some serious forgettable forays into Hollywood such as Gothika and Babylon A. D. and a spattering of other forgotten about foreign films, actor/director Kassovitz can always hang his hat on La Haine as a documentary like exploration of his home city and his own experiences as youth in the often boiling pot of emotions that exist in France's most well-known city.Never bothering with a straight forward narrative driver, as Kassovitz instead examines an event filled 24 hours in the lives of acquittances and Paris residents Vinz (Cassel), Hubert (Kounde) and Said (Taghmaoui), with the three teenagers full of anger and hostility following on from their involvement in a series of riots that sprung up in the wake of a police beating of a young man they all know.All three performers deliver feisty and energetic turns, particularly from the then 28 year old Vincent Cassel who brings Vinz to life with a verve and fierceness that held him in good stead for what has been so far an extremely consistent and intriguing career and as Kassovitz throws his three characters, actors and audiences into the thick of an unpredictable time and place we are drawn into a life like and confronting drama that unfortunately feels as though it could've been drawn straight from today's headlines.Initially upon release only a minor hit despite strong reviews and audience reactions, La Haine's ability to continue to be spoken about and affect modern day audiences has ensured its standing as one of the great examples of world cinema and one of the most memorable cinematic ventures France has ever produced, one that's power was so evident upon release with then Prime Minister Alain Juppé screening the film for his parliament, such was its effectiveness in exploring issues present then and still today in the country.Final Say -A searing independent offering that may be rough around the edges in parts but still full of power and importance, La Haine is a once in a blue moon type cinematic offering that remains relevant and needful to this day.4 missed trains out of 5.",heartfelt relevant tale injustice humanity,incendiary independent black white offering france that has managed remain relevant oft spoken about these 25 plus years initial release mathieu kassovitzs personal heartfelt la haine simply meaning hate is memorable exploration social injustice simmering tensions feat its filmmaker will always struggle too top following up his work here with some serious forgettable forays into hollywood such as gothika babylon d spattering other forgotten about foreign films actor director kassovitz can always hang his hat la haine as documentary like exploration his home city his own experiences as youth often boiling pot emotions that exist frances most well known city never bothering with straight forward narrative driver as kassovitz instead examines event filled 24 hours lives acquittances paris residents vinz cassel hubert kounde said taghmaoui with three teenagers full anger hostility following their involvement series riots that sprung up wake police beating young man they all know all three performers deliver feisty energetic turns particularly then 28 year old vincent cassel who brings vinz life with verve fierceness that held him good stead what has been so far extremely consistent intriguing career as kassovitz throws his three characters actors audiences into thick unpredictable time place we are drawn into life like confronting drama that unfortunately feels as though it couldve been drawn straight todays headlines initially upon release only minor hit despite strong reviews audience reactions la haines ability continue be spoken about affect modern day audiences has ensured its standing as one great examples world cinema one most memorable cinematic ventures france has ever produced one thats power was so evident upon release with then prime minister alain jupp screening film his parliament such was its effectiveness exploring issues present then still today country final say searing independent offering that may be rough around edges parts but still full power importance la haine is once blue moon type cinematic offering that remains relevant needful this day 4 missed trains out 5,0.48585552865213877,0.09943502824858759,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10.0,great movie about social problems and how they're being dealt with,"When the riots broke out last autumn in Paris..the first thing I thought about was this movie. I put on the TV and all the scenes reminded me off the best movie ever made in Europe, and the best on the subject...La Haine The first time I saw the movie in 2003, we was gonna watch it for school. At first I thought it was gonna be another french movie about a young french girl that got pregnant(we watched a lot of those in French lessons)...but what followed was probably the most defining 90 minutes in my life.When the movie started with the images of riots (real riots, old news footage) combined with Bob Marley's ""Burning and Looting"" I was getting fascinated about this movie, this had to be good. A lot of things were very recognizable, everyone knows a ""Said"", everyone knows a ""Hubert"" and at the time I was feeling like ""Vinz"". All the scenes influenced me and were very recognizable, the hanging around with friends, the way of talking, the arguments they used for their deeds...everything. The end shocked me and I couldn't really think anything else then ""I got to watch this movie again"", and the day after I bought a DVD of it.The movie tells the story of a black, Arab and Jewish guy who live in a housing project near Paris, the kind of neighborhood where most of the people don't have a job, where the youth bores itself and flirts with criminal behavior, where drugs are being sold and where an occasional riot starts (this happened from the 80's until recently from time to time). The movie follows them 24 hours after their friend Adbel got beat up by the police during the riots, where a cop lost his gun. Vinz (the Jewish guy) found the gun and swears that when Abdel dies he's gonna take vengeance by killing a police. With Vinz - not being the most stable nor the most smart and relaxed person - having a gun on him the three come in some hard situations, but also without the police gun they have enough problems during the 24 hours....I ain't gonna spoil anything, but this should be enough to make you wanting to watch this movie.After watching it a couple of times I realized that this was a story, I always thought it was a documentary, which is a big compliment to the whole crew I think. But still that didn't made the movie less strong, the greatest thing about it is that it isn't easy made, no clichés...when you watch an American movie on the subject there always is some form of exit for the main character or he dies in a way that makes you think he deserves it. So either way a character is portrayed as a nice guy or a total bad guy, who both have girl who want to get them out of troubles. This is where La Haine sets itself apart from other movies, it doesn't try to portray the characters as nice people, although you do feel sympathies for them. The best thing is the end, which sets the movie mostly apart and makes it more recognizable for the European crowd (I'm not gonna spoil it, but if it ended differently the movie wouldn't been so great) The way it is shot in black and white makes it look realer, makes it grimier, it portrays the banlieues as a place without an exit. That's what maybe sets the movie also apart, the black and white makes it look arty and grimy at the same time. Maybe the best is that it still doesn't look dated because of that.Another great thing is the soundtrack, all the songs that are used in the movie have a great effect on the images and visa versa. Bob Marley perfectly fits the riots, Isaac Hayes fits the hashish packing and smoking scenes, Zapp and Roger fits the break dance song perfectly and the Expression Direct fits the haunted car scene in inner city Paris perfect (if you can understand the lyrics). But what really sets this movie apart is the Cutkiller scene, this scene only made me wanted to get a set of SL1200's...The way the tension is build in the movie is great, most of the time the characters don't do anything, but you still feel the tension building, the hate growing, and when you maybe bored watching some scenes the first time (the ""candit-camera"" scene for instance and the ""eiffeltower"" scene), but afterwards they're like pieces of a puzzle falling into it's place. Some shots are brilliantly, the Taxi Driver imitation of Vinz at the beginning (when you already see that Vinz is losing it), the police interview shot with Said and Hubert, the discussion at the toilets, the way the characters are introduced, the subway shot...it's all eye candy.To make a conclusion, if you love hip hop and don't think the police as necessarily the representation of the good in society. of course when you love cinema it is also a good movie, but it really is a movie which has it own public: the youth. If your Dutch try to get hold of the 7 euro Freerecord shop version, but I can recommend the English 10 year anniversary more...the directors commentary, trailers and bonus material make this a really nice DVD. But I can understand why a lot of people don't like it, it doesn't offer solutions, it doesn't give an opinion on anything except the police, and of course you have to have a certain frame of mind to like the movie.",great movie about social problems how theyre being dealt with,when riots broke out last autumn paris first thing i thought about was this movie i put tv all scenes reminded me off best movie ever made europe best subject la haine first time i saw movie 2003 we was gonna watch it school at first i thought it was gonna be another french movie about young french girl that got pregnant we watched lot those french lessons but what followed was probably most defining 90 minutes my life when movie started with images riots real riots old news footage combined with bob marleys burning looting i was getting fascinated about this movie this had be good lot things were very recognizable everyone knows said everyone knows hubert at time i was feeling like vinz all scenes influenced me were very recognizable hanging around with friends way talking arguments they used their deeds everything end shocked me i couldnt really think anything else then i got watch this movie again day after i bought dvd it movie tells story black arab jewish guy who live housing project near paris kind neighborhood where most people dont have job where youth bores itself flirts with criminal behavior where drugs are being sold where occasional riot starts this happened 80s until recently time time movie follows them 24 hours after their friend adbel got beat up by police during riots where cop lost his gun vinz jewish guy found gun swears that when abdel dies hes gonna take vengeance by killing police with vinz not being most stable nor most smart relaxed person having gun him three come some hard situations but also without police gun they have enough problems during 24 hours i aint gonna spoil anything but this should be enough make you wanting watch this movie after watching it couple times i realized that this was story i always thought it was documentary which is big compliment whole crew i think but still that didnt made movie less strong greatest thing about it is that it isnt easy made no clich s when you watch american movie subject there always is some form exit main character or he dies way that makes you think he deserves it so either way character is portrayed as nice guy or total bad guy who both have girl who want get them out troubles this is where la haine sets itself apart other movies it doesnt try portray characters as nice people although you do feel sympathies them best thing is end which sets movie mostly apart makes it more recognizable european crowd im not gonna spoil it but if it ended differently movie wouldnt been so great way it is shot black white makes it look realer makes it grimier it portrays banlieues as place without exit thats what maybe sets movie also apart black white makes it look arty grimy at same time maybe best is that it still doesnt look dated because that another great thing is soundtrack all songs that are used movie have great effect images visa versa bob marley perfectly fits riots isaac hayes fits hashish packing smoking scenes zapp roger fits break dance song perfectly expression direct fits haunted car scene inner city paris perfect if you can understand lyrics but what really sets this movie apart is cutkiller scene this scene only made me wanted get set sl1200s way tension is build movie is great most time characters dont do anything but you still feel tension building hate growing when you maybe bored watching some scenes first time candit camera scene instance eiffeltower scene but afterwards theyre like pieces puzzle falling into its place some shots are brilliantly taxi driver imitation vinz at beginning when you already see that vinz is losing it police interview shot with said hubert discussion at toilets way characters are introduced subway shot its all eye candy make conclusion if you love hip hop dont think police as necessarily representation good society course when you love cinema it is also good movie but it really is movie which has it own public youth if your dutch try get hold 7 euro freerecord shop version but i can recommend english 10 year anniversary more directors commentary trailers bonus material make this really nice dvd but i can understand why lot people dont like it it doesnt offer solutions it doesnt give opinion anything except police course you have have certain frame mind like movie,0.458308004052685,0.25122271345675606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
