6,silly and formulaic by design,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.Opening in theaters on March 25, 2022.",silly formulaic by design,greetings again darkness its not billed as remake romancing stone 1984 perhaps thats because it borrows many adventure romantic comedies over years brothers co directors aaron nee adam nee band robbers 2015 have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised script by co writers oren uziel mortal combat 2021 dana fox cruella 2021 seth gordon receives story credit which is bit ironic considering he has been quoted with best stories are rooted reality oscar winner sandra bullock stars as grieving reclusive highly successful romance novelist loretta sage channing tatum co stars as her long time extremely popular cover model adam what is obviously wink nod fabio lorettas love history passing her husband have combined make her despise books she writes publicity tours shes required attend especially when being forced wear skintight purple fuchsia sequined onesie other hand vapid model adam relishes giving audience what they want strutting hair waving bare chest after their most recent event goes sideways loretta is kidnapped by villainous rich guy with so called gender neutral name abigail fairfax daniel radcliffe hes read her latest book needs her help locating crown fire hidden somewhere remote island he purchased this reason things have move quickly before volcano erupts buries treasure at this point adam is committed rescuing loretta proving that hes more than pretty face lorettas stressed out literary agent beth davine joy randolph dolemite is my name 2019 is determined save her writer asset while newly hired social media director patti harrison acts goofy deserved better lines its regrettable yet sign times that 2 time oscar winner brad pitts cameo is included trailer this should have been pleasant surprise viewers instead is spoiled by clip he has fun with his role as former navy seal meditation partner with adam as two work towards lorettas rescue time island combines adventure sequences with slow build romantic bond between loretta adam both actors do their thing its mostly mr radcliffe who seems bit out place as he goes big his role as villain when some subtlety might have played better then again there is nothing subtle about this production including scenes with beth oddball pilot with goat fetish played by oscar nunez office sandra bullock channing tatum can play these characters their sleep their credit they both seem engaged willing put forth necessary effort tatum especially embraces duality preening cover boy sensitive type out prove he has substance its easy film criticize but why would you its meant be harmless fun bring joy movie lovers its totally fine make silly formulaic movie when your objective is make silly formulaic movie opening theaters march 25 2022,0.4946280991735536,0.16793388429752068,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.49}"
5,Pieces that work and pieces that don't,"The Lost City has pieces that work and pieces that don't. Placing pretenders into an actual adventure is good for laughs and heart, yet much of this script is generic. Unimaginative MacGuffins, flat villains, and predictable romances are individually forgivable, but together, they override the premise's charm. Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum's charisma shines through and Pitt's cameo provides flavor, but that isn't enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn't painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.Meanwhile, The Lost City's filmmaking is average. Its minor positives are the cinematography (intermittently dramatizing comedy and action), the sound (selling the combat and jungle setting), the production design (primarily real but often computerized), and the effects (employing real explosions amongst the CGI). Conversely, the editing occasionally sags (lingering on unessential jokes) and the music is distractingly trendy (forcing fun, rather than serving the narrative). Lastly, The Lost City lacks cohesion. Its humor and emotions never tonally blend, and instead take turns (which disconnects viewers). Ultimately, The Lost City has mild appeal, but functions inconsistently.Writing: 3/10 Direction: 3/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Acting: 5/10 Editing: 4/10 Sound: 6/10 Score/Soundtrack: 4/10 Production Design: 6/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 6/10Overall Score: 5.1/10.",pieces that work pieces that dont,lost city has pieces that work pieces that dont placing pretenders into actual adventure is good laughs heart yet much this script is generic unimaginative macguffins flat villains predictable romances are individually forgivable but together they override premises charm furthermore dialogue humor plot devices are subpar cast enhances material especially pitt radcliffe but some scenes are groaners tatums charisma shines through pitts cameo provides flavor but that isnt enough pull lost city out mediocrity it isnt painful but lost city misses more than it hits meanwhile lost citys filmmaking is average its minor positives are cinematography intermittently dramatizing comedy action sound selling combat jungle setting production design primarily real but often computerized effects employing real explosions amongst cgi conversely editing occasionally sags lingering unessential jokes music is distractingly trendy forcing fun rather than serving narrative lastly lost city lacks cohesion its humor emotions never tonally blend instead take turns which disconnects viewers ultimately lost city has mild appeal but functions inconsistently writing 3 10 direction 3 10 cinematography 6 10 acting 5 10 editing 4 10 sound 6 10 score soundtrack 4 10 production design 6 10 casting 8 10 effects 6 10overall score 5 1 10,0.38141025641025644,0.10032051282051281,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.32}"

1,Truly a waste of time and talent,"I can't quite understand how these actors would choose to make such a unfunny comedy. The humor is so basic and simple that I can't believe the actors thought this would work. With movies like these it feels as though mainstream Hollywood is intentionally trying to dumb down the population or they have become so arrogant they think they can throw a few good actors together in a film that's made with 110% cheese! It's a cheese party and laughs and humor weren't invited! And the prized guests of the party were signs and facepalms whilst shaking ones head. Was this to make a quick buck? Maybe help out a fellow producer or writer who is a friend? Or maybe they just rely on the names to bring in the money, but I don't see how any of the stars in the film can actually watch this film and feel at all good about themselves and the product they've put out. It's just a complete and utter fail from the very beginning. All I was wondering throughout the film is ""why?""",truly waste time talent,i cant quite understand how these actors would choose make such unfunny comedy humor is so basic simple that i cant believe actors thought this would work with movies like these it feels as though mainstream hollywood is intentionally trying dumb down population or they have become so arrogant they think they can throw few good actors together film thats made with 110 cheese its cheese party laughs humor werent invited prized guests party were signs facepalms whilst shaking ones head was this make quick buck maybe help out fellow producer or writer who is friend or maybe they just rely names bring money but i dont see how any stars film can actually watch this film feel at all good about themselves product theyve put out its just complete utter fail very beginning all i was wondering throughout film is why,0.3780687830687831,0.04018518518518518,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
7,"A Solid, Throwback Comedy","Mainstream comedies that actually make it to theatres are slim to none these days. I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.To put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she's on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of ""The Lost City of D,"" but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it's pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods.This premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I'm very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.I'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.In the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don't think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously. Now playing in theatres, I'd give a recommendation to The Lost City.",solid throwback comedy,mainstream comedies that actually make it theatres are slim none these days i remember time when there was possibly big comedy coming out every one or two months with at least half them being good but todays climate humour is just tough get right i was very happy see that paramount would be taking chance releasing big comedy lost city this year but i truly didnt know what expect it after seeing it theatres im happy say that i had good time with it its not great but it felt like throwback comedy just with modern twist put it simply lost city follows loretta sandra bullock as shes book tour with her cover model alan channing tatum promote release lost city d but they are swept up kidnapping find themselves real adventure jungle abigail fairfax daniel radcliffe is reason loretta was kidnapped first place as he sees many similarities her book that real lost city being privileged twerp that he is makes fun villainous storyline even if its pretty lame at times radcliffe aside whom i still enjoyed this film puts all its weight tatum bullock deliver goods this premise is clever enough work as film but it all comes down who you cast if they can make material work i never thought i needed see this duo together but im very happy they worked so well top that i have admit that best moments film feature brad pitts character jack trainer he isnt film much but every second he was screen had me laughing where i found film be slightly uneven though was fact that i wasnt sure if it wanted be funny or dramatic at times im all heartfelt storylines as well as comedy but i would argue that majority humour is first half while second half gets little more sentimental these both worked movie but way film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as what film will become by end i found that odd but again cast sold all dialogue me few hilarious moments some fun adventure action throughout as i said i had good time with this one end lost city is exactly what i think moviegoers need right now nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama this is good old fashioned silly comedy romance that i feel works what it is its not going be type comedy that lot people are going watch over over again at least i dont think but heart film is right place it never takes anything too seriously now playing theatres id give recommendation lost city,0.4864363778298205,0.12901053864168616,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.37}"

7,"Simple, fun, hilarious....","7.0/10I actually enjoyed this film way more than I expected. It perfectly fits into its categories of action, adventure, comedy, and romance.The story was very enjoyable. It started off kind of wonky and felt like I was in for a bad time, but once the ""prologue"" passed and the main portion of the movie started it got much better.The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked surprisingly well, and only got better as the film progressed. I did enjoy Daniel Radcliffe as the antagonist. More of a bratty rich boy than an evil ""I want to murder everyone"" kind of bad guy.By the end I felt that the big part of the film was that the romance was definitely geared towards the women while the action parts were geared towards the men. The comedy could've gone either way, and some may find certain parts funnier than others, both scenes and what's actually funny.I also enjoyed the score. The way certain soundtracks were worked into the scenes noticeably helped enhance them (as soundtracks should).Overall, I think this film is perfect for a movie date night. It's funny, it's romantic, it has a pretty good action/adventure story and it's not as cheesy as most romcoms tend to be.I hope my review helps you make a choice on this film. Until next time....

1,What a hapless abomination,"The makers of this movie are not a stupid as you would think having watched this garbage because they were smart enough to overplay Bratt Pitt's role which is 90% of the trailer and 1% of the film, the only good 1%. The writing is horrific, the acting wooden, the dialogue embarrassing and the plot stolen from Romancing The Stone.

1,Poor man's Romancing the Stone,What in the world is Sandra Bullock thinking??? Aside of being a total ripoff of the above mentioned movie this was just as stupid as it looked. Sandra is an ok actress but as a worldwide bestselling author why would she ever appear in a jumpsuit in any capacity??? And Channing Tatum while handsome is about as charismatic as a bag of potatoes. Cameos never really help the plot along and this insipid movie needed all the help it could get. Douglas and Turner had the movie down cold about 30 years ago so I shut this one off and watched the original instead.,poor mans romancing stone,what world is sandra bullock thinking aside being total ripoff above mentioned movie this was just as stupid as it looked sandra is ok actress but as worldwide bestselling author why would she ever appear jumpsuit any capacity channing tatum while handsome is about as charismatic as bag potatoes cameos never really help plot along this insipid movie needed all help it could get douglas turner had movie down cold about 30 years ago so i shut this one off watched original instead,0.6535353535353535,-0.016414141414141416,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.64, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.14}"

3,The lost 1hr 52min of my life,"OK. First they openly admit the plot of this movie is very similar (read obvious, shameless, blatant rip-off) to Romancing The Stone. Only difference is they added a little more (cough) humor. And a goat. Oh, and some leeches. Sandra Bullock plays Sandra Bullock Doing Another Rom-com. Channing Tatum plays a great big bag of muscles that can talk. Brad Pitt thankfully shows up (for a very short time) and steals the show with the only real laughs. Well, him and the goat. And Daniel Radcliffe is in it too. If anybody cares. I don't. Most of the jokes in the film fall flat and just lay there. Like a dead fish. The whole thing feels kinda lazy. Like they just stole a bunch of stuff from other movies, threw 'em together and hoped for the best. I guess there are worse ways to spend 2 hours. Like having a B-list actress pull leeches off my behind. (Very awkward, unfunny scene. One of many.) Anyway, go and see it if you want. Just set the bar pretty low. 3 stars.",lost 1hr 52min my life,ok first they openly admit plot this movie is very similar read obvious shameless blatant rip off romancing stone only difference is they added little more cough humor goat oh some leeches sandra bullock plays sandra bullock doing another rom com channing tatum plays great big bag muscles that can talk brad pitt thankfully shows up very short time steals show with only real laughs well him goat daniel radcliffe is it too if anybody cares i dont most jokes film fall flat just lay there like dead fish whole thing feels kinda lazy like they just stole bunch stuff other movies threw em together hoped best i guess there are worse ways spend 2 hours like having b list actress pull leeches off my behind very awkward unfunny scene one many anyway go see it if you want just set bar pretty low 3 stars,0.5404938271604939,0.06787037037037037,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.19}"
7,Needs more Brad Pitt,"The chemistry between Bullock and Pitt is beyond words even though for only a minute or two. It's so powerful that it dulls the chemistry between Channing and Bullock. It's too bad that Brad wasn't given a much larger role as he has a real knack for comedy. It was likely to keep costs down or maybe he couldn't commit to more shooting days. If budget wasn't an issue I would have written a few more Pitt scenes in and maybe less goat. They tried to milk the goat bit (sorry) and it just wasn't funny. Radcliffe was good too and again he could have used a few more scenes. Still, money well spent just to watch Brad for a few minutes as he stole the entire movie.",needs more brad pitt,chemistry between bullock pitt is beyond words even though only minute or two its so powerful that it dulls chemistry between channing bullock its too bad that brad wasnt given much larger role as he has real knack comedy it was likely keep costs down or maybe he couldnt commit more shooting days if budget wasnt issue i would have written few more pitt scenes maybe less goat they tried milk goat bit sorry it just wasnt funny radcliffe was good too again he could have used few more scenes still money well spent just watch brad few minutes as he stole entire movie,0.5022486772486772,0.053703703703703705,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9,Moving on,"I try to avoid watching trailers before I see a movie. Sometimes it is inevitable - you can't escape certain trailers. So while I still managed not to see everything the trailer revealed, I already knew from the looks of it, that I would like the movie. And lo and behold the movie delivers the goods.There may be certain role reversals (or gender cliches that are being made fun of if you want to call it that), but the way the actors are playing their roles will not make you think too much about that. At least not in a negative light - some people seem to be allergic when it comes to ""wokeness"" I reckon.Channing Tatum has no problem taking his own image apart. Though he still will not accept bad dancing - but that is a different story. Harry Radcliffe ... I mean Daniel Potter ... ah well, the guy formerly known - actually still known as Harry Potter plays quite the fine villain.There is an excellent cameo in this and there is also a bonus scene during the credits that you cannot miss under any circumstances. Sit back, relax and if the humor is your cup of tea, you'll have a blast with this.",moving,i try avoid watching trailers before i see movie sometimes it is inevitable you cant escape certain trailers so while i still managed not see everything trailer revealed i already knew looks it that i would like movie lo behold movie delivers goods there may be certain role reversals or gender cliches that are being made fun if you want call it that but way actors are playing their roles will not make you think too much about that at least not negative light some people seem be allergic when it comes wokeness i reckon channing tatum has no problem taking his own image apart though he still will not accept bad dancing but that is different story harry radcliffe i mean daniel potter ah well guy formerly known actually still known as harry potter plays quite fine villain there is excellent cameo this there is also bonus scene during credits that you cannot miss under any circumstances sit back relax if humor is your cup tea youll have blast with this,0.5057072829131651,0.12839635854341735,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.44}"
