10.0,"Extremeley Powerful, With Superb Performances","A film fully deserving to be in IMDb's top 250, Jim Sheridan's ""In The Name of the Father"" is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story, the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis) who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case, but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family, including his father Giuseppe (Postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up, and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however, as they start to go through the ordeal together, Gerry gradually matures, and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.The story is heart-breaking and shocking at the same time, all the more so when one realizes that these things actually DID happen. Although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film, the backbone of the story is left completely intact.The two protagonists, Daniel Day-Liewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances, and they both deserved the Oscar hands-down. However, it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in his/her role.Jim Sheridan's direction is also very good, giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective; although the film might initially appear as pro-Irish / anti-English, in fact I consider it as quite objective. Granted, it vividly shows that some key figures in the London police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the Conlons; yet, it also shows that English public attitudes turned highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. We have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions, with emotions running high to levels of hysteria, so we have to understand the events within this context.Of course, what happened to the Conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable; and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. Still, one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy (such as the judge, for example), who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. The Conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place, in the wrong time, and with the wrong nationality; the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent.""In the Name of the Father"" is a fantastic film, which one should not miss. 10/10.",extremeley powerful with superb performances,film fully deserving be imdbs top 250 jim sheridans name father is excellent piece work based true very touching story film recounts story gerry conlon day lewis who is wrongly accused as ira terrorist not only are police bending facts prove their case but process they also implicate members his friends family including his father giuseppe postlethwaithe whose health condition is rather frail gerry is rebellious mildly delinquent boy who does not seem have grown up his attitude toward his father is not appropriate one however as they start go through ordeal together gerry gradually matures starts feeling deep affection respect giuseppe story is heart breaking shocking at same time all more so when one realizes that these things actually did happen although there have been some minor modifications purpose film backbone story is left completely intact two protagonists daniel day liewis pete postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances they both deserved oscar hands down however it would be unfair not mention that virtually everyone film is great his her role jim sheridans direction is also very good giving plot fair balanced perspective although film might initially appear as pro irish anti english fact i consider it as quite objective granted it vividly shows that some key figures london police were profoundly biased manipulated maliciously case against conlons yet it also shows that english public attitudes turned highly supportive conlons freedom when it started become clear that they were not culprits atrocities they had been charged with we have always remember that film depicts period big tensions with emotions running high levels hysteria so we have understand events within this context course what happened conlons is totally deplorable unjustifiable it is real shame that people who conspired against them have not been punished yet their crimes still one should understand hostile attitude shown by those who were not part this conspiracy such as judge example who were influenced by climate terror outrage public conlons had terribly bad luck be at wrong place wrong time with wrong nationality also have great misfortune be captured by people who their quest show results were shamelessly willing risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent name father is fantastic film which one should not miss 10 10,0.5823444444444443,0.11812222222222223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,Stunning.,"Words cannot accurately describe how affecting this movie is.  The story itself is harrowing, but the way in which Day Lewis portrays Gerry Conlon is heartbreaking at times. Several scenes in the film may be hard to take for those with a sensitive nature.  Captures the mood and the time perfectly for someone like me, who is not Irish, lives nowhere near Guildford and wasn't even alive at the time of the pub bombings.  I really wasn't expecting anything special when I sat down to watch this. I could not have been more wrong.  The soundtrack is great without exception too!

7.0,Innocence Is Not An Absolute,"Like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER is a an extremely well made film , but like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS much of it is total invention . Reviewers on this page have already pointed out the numerous errors such as Guiseppe and Gerry Conlon never being imprisoned in the same jail or the "" Guilford four "" and "" Mcguire seven "" trials taking place in completely seperate court cases but no one seems to have pointed out the erroneous backgrounds this film paints of Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill. In their book THE PROVISIONAL IRA authors Patrick Bishop and Eamon Mallie state the facts quite clearly that Paul Hill was a member of the Belfast brigade of the provisonal IRA ( And Hill later did confess to being a member ) while Conlon had been a member of Na Fianna Eireann which is the youth section of the provisionals though Conlon was quickly kicked out ( Literally ) due to his heavy drinking and drug taking . They didn`t meet on the ferry as shown in the film but Conlon bumped into Hill in Southampton where Hill was staying . What was Hill doing in Southampton ? He was on the run from the IRA who wanted to question him about guns going missing and about the possibility of Hill being an informer , something that is always punishable in IRA ranks with death and prior torture . When Conlon returned to Belfast in December 1974 he did drunkenly mention to IRA acquaintances in pubs that he`d met Hill in England and in order to punish Hill for his suspected crimes against the organisation and to take the heat off their own cells active in Britain at the time it was the IRA themselves who deliberately leaked the false information to the intelligence services about Conlon and Hill being involved in the Guilford bombings , not as the film shows a jealous boyfriend . Hill was also later found guilty of the murder of a former soldier though is never shown in the film and it`s this playing hard and loose with the facts that almost threatens to destroy the film . It could have been worse though , there might have been the suggestion that the bombing could have been a mass suicide Well that`s the bad points out of the way . What`s IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER`s good points ? Well Jim Sheridan directs with a real kinetic force especially the early scene where Conlon is pursued by the Brits against a voodoo chile soundscape . Sheridan also gets the very best out of his cast . Emma Thompson is good as the crusading lawyer , Pete Postlethwaite is very good as Guiseppe Conlon , but the outstanding performance is by Daniel Day Lewis as Gerry Conlon . Has anyone noticed the bitter Irony of a film about injustice features one of the greatest injustices commited by the Oscar board voters where they gave that year`s best actor Oscar to a very average performance by Tom Hanks ? No wonder more and more people view the Oscars as a popularity contest . And despite my above criticisms about the facts - or lack of them - IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER can in no way be described as a pro IRA film in the way that THE DEVIL`S OWN or SOME MOTHER`S SON are",innocence is not absolute,like midnight express name father is extremely well made film but like midnight express much it is total invention reviewers this page have already pointed out numerous errors such as guiseppe gerry conlon never being imprisoned same jail or guilford four mcguire seven trials taking place completely seperate court cases but no one seems have pointed out erroneous backgrounds this film paints gerry conlon paul hill their book provisional ira authors patrick bishop eamon mallie state facts quite clearly that paul hill was member belfast brigade provisonal ira hill later did confess being member while conlon had been member na fianna eireann which is youth section provisionals though conlon was quickly kicked out literally due his heavy drinking drug taking they didn t meet ferry as shown film but conlon bumped into hill southampton where hill was staying what was hill doing southampton he was run ira who wanted question him about guns going missing about possibility hill being informer something that is always punishable ira ranks with death prior torture when conlon returned belfast december 1974 he did drunkenly mention ira acquaintances pubs that he d met hill england order punish hill his suspected crimes against organisation take heat off their own cells active britain at time it was ira themselves who deliberately leaked false information intelligence services about conlon hill being involved guilford bombings not as film shows jealous boyfriend hill was also later found guilty murder former soldier though is never shown film it s this playing hard loose with facts that almost threatens destroy film it could have been worse though there might have been suggestion that bombing could have been mass suicide well that s bad points out way what s name father s good points well jim sheridan directs with real kinetic force especially early scene where conlon is pursued by brits against voodoo chile soundscape sheridan also gets very best out his cast emma thompson is good as crusading lawyer pete postlethwaite is very good as guiseppe conlon but outstanding performance is by daniel day lewis as gerry conlon has anyone noticed bitter irony film about injustice features one greatest injustices commited by oscar board voters where they gave that year s best actor oscar very average performance by tom hanks no wonder more more people view oscars as popularity contest despite my above criticisms about facts or lack them name father can no way be described as pro ira film way that devil s own or some mother s son are,0.48633089133089136,0.10943833943833946,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,A Very Sharp Film,"What a clever film this was. Quite modest yet remarkably entertaining. Instead of blaring political bias, viewers are treated to a compassionate human drama without the preachings and irritating banter of most other ""social dramas"" (Dog Day Afternoon, All the President's Men, Norma Rae). It's shameful that this film didn't receive at least two academy awards, despite it having been nominated for 7. Now considering that this was the same year that Schindler's List and The Piano, two outstanding dramas, were released, it isnt surprising nor unreasonable that they beat In the Name of the Father for many of the awards.The acting in this film is terrific. Lewis is low key and quite effective as the petty Irish thief Gerry Conlon. Pete Postlethwaite is spectacular as Gerry's father Guiseppe (certainly better than oscar winner tommy lee jones was in the fugitive). Emma Thompson's portrayal of attorney Gareth Pierce received much acclaim, and properly so. Beatie Edney, who had a small part as a wrongfully accused British teenage hippie, was so enamoring that its a wonder we don't see more of her.Of course much of this film is exagerrated and perhaps fabricated for the purposes of entertainment (as all movies which are ""based on a true story"" tend to be) but it's so finely done that it doesn't seem to matter. Some terrific scenes include the beginning, when Gerry and his friends are chased by British soldiers after being mistaken for IRA snipers, the trial in London, the prison scenes (which expose the loneliness and honesty of the characters rather than the crude violence and gang rapes of so many other pathetic prison movies), and of course the powerful ending, where the marvelous dramatic talents of all the actors are evinced in a final crescendo. Be sure to see this film if you haven't, it will definitely stir your emotions and renew your faith in the human spirit. And for those who eschew political films, give it a try anyways, the acting and craftiness outweigh the civic themes.",very sharp film,what clever film this was quite modest yet remarkably entertaining instead blaring political bias viewers are treated compassionate human drama without preachings irritating banter most other social dramas dog day afternoon all presidents men norma rae its shameful that this film didnt receive at least two academy awards despite it having been nominated 7 now considering that this was same year that schindlers list piano two outstanding dramas were released it isnt surprising nor unreasonable that they beat name father many awards acting this film is terrific lewis is low key quite effective as petty irish thief gerry conlon pete postlethwaite is spectacular as gerrys father guiseppe certainly better than oscar winner tommy lee jones was fugitive emma thompsons portrayal attorney gareth pierce received much acclaim properly so beatie edney who had small part as wrongfully accused british teenage hippie was so enamoring that its wonder we dont see more her course much this film is exagerrated perhaps fabricated purposes entertainment as all movies which are based true story tend be but its so finely done that it doesnt seem matter some terrific scenes include beginning when gerry his friends are chased by british soldiers after being mistaken ira snipers trial london prison scenes which expose loneliness honesty characters rather than crude violence gang rapes so many other pathetic prison movies course powerful ending where marvelous dramatic talents all actors are evinced final crescendo be sure see this film if you havent it will definitely stir your emotions renew your faith human spirit those who eschew political films give it try anyways acting craftiness outweigh civic themes,0.5127893518518519,0.10772569444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,Disquieting great film,"The movie is based on a true story. Belfast guy Gerry Conlon is suspected of being one of the IRA terrorists responsible for a bomb in Guilford, London, in 1974, which killed several people. He spends 15 years in jail, fighting for his innocence and for truth.After working with Daniel Day Lewis in ""My left foot"", director Jim Sheridan teams again with the actor for this drama. The strong cast is completed by Emma Thomson and Pete Postlewaite. The result is a brilliant, passionate feature which tells about injustice. It's a disquieting film.This is doubtless the most achieved collaboration between the director and the main star. The other pictures as well are very good, but here we have a film of accusation -the story is more involving. Day Lewis performance in ""My left foot"" was awarded with an Oscar, but the actor could have been given the same prize for his play of Gerry Conlon.Strong screenplay, actors and soundtrack -with music of Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer and songs of Irish stars Bono and Sinead O'Connor.",disquieting great film,movie is based true story belfast guy gerry conlon is suspected being one ira terrorists responsible bomb guilford london 1974 which killed several people he spends 15 years jail fighting his innocence truth after working with daniel day lewis my left foot director jim sheridan teams again with actor this drama strong cast is completed by emma thomson pete postlewaite result is brilliant passionate feature which tells about injustice its disquieting film this is doubtless most achieved collaboration between director main star other pictures as well are very good but here we have film accusation story is more involving day lewis performance my left foot was awarded with oscar but actor could have been given same prize his play gerry conlon strong screenplay actors soundtrack with music gavin friday maurice seezer songs irish stars bono sinead oconnor,0.4147368421052631,0.24833333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.5}"
8.0,Perhaps a bit too black and white but still very impressive.,"Even though this movie seems a bit too black and white from time to time I must say that it still is an impressive piece of cinema. Too black and white because I sometimes had the feeling that they had left out some parts to make it all a lot easier for the viewer. I can't help believing that Conlon and Hill weren't the nicest guys either, but the movie shows them almost as saints (except for the fact that they steal some lead from the roofs, they never really do anything wrong). Does that mean that this movie isn't any good? Certainly not! It still remains very impressive and the idea that injustice in the name of protecting the country should be allowed is awful and so it is good that at least some movie makers aren't afraid to protest against it.The movie tells the story about Gerry Conlon and his old school friend Paul Hill. They both are small time criminals and because of their own safety they have to live in London for a while. Otherwise they might get shot by the IRA. In London they stay in a community of hippies, but aren't welcomed by everybody. As a bomb explodes in a pub, one of the members from the community goes to the police and accuses them of the crime. They are immediately apprehended, together with Conlon's father, his aunt and her family. What follows is a process full of corruption and false accusations, putting them in jail for many years even though they haven't done anything wrong.The film is very good. It's well acted, well paced and well directed. The story is touching and I never got bored when watching it. Therefor I give it an 8/10.",perhaps bit too black white but still very impressive,even though this movie seems bit too black white time time i must say that it still is impressive piece cinema too black white because i sometimes had feeling that they had left out some parts make it all lot easier viewer i cant help believing that conlon hill werent nicest guys either but movie shows them almost as saints except fact that they steal some lead roofs they never really do anything wrong does that mean that this movie isnt any good certainly not it still remains very impressive idea that injustice name protecting country should be allowed is awful so it is good that at least some movie makers arent afraid protest against it movie tells story about gerry conlon his old school friend paul hill they both are small time criminals because their own safety they have live london while otherwise they might get shot by ira london they stay community hippies but arent welcomed by everybody as bomb explodes pub one members community goes police accuses them crime they are immediately apprehended together with conlons father his aunt her family what follows is process full corruption false accusations putting them jail many years even though they havent done anything wrong film is very good its well acted well paced well directed story is touching i never got bored when watching it therefor i give it 8 10,0.5512557603686636,0.0750555090071219,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.24}"
7.0,In the Name of the Father- and of the Son,"Although considerable liberties have been taken with historical facts, this film is based upon true events. In 1974 an IRA bomb in a pub in Guildford, England, killed several people. Four young Irish people (""the Guildford Four"") were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Several others (""the Maguire Seven"") were convicted of assisting them and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. All were innocent of this crime, and were later exonerated and released from prison when fresh evidence was discovered, particularly evidence that their confessions had been obtained under duress.Although all the main characters are Catholics, some devout, some only nominally so, the title does not have any real religious significance. Rather, it alludes to the film's central relationship, that between Gerry Conlon, one of the ""Four"" and his father Giuseppe, one of the ""Seven"". The two are very different. Gerry is a wild and rebellious young man, unemployed, a petty criminal and a drug-user. He wears his hair long, something fashionable in the early seventies but often regarded by the older generation as the sign of a hooligan. Giuseppe, by contrast, is a conservative figure; deeply religious, hard-working, law-abiding and honest.A key moment comes when Gerry recalls a football match in which he played as a boy. His team won, but instead of congratulating him on his victory, Giuseppe reproached his son for a foul committed during the match. This encapsulates the difference in their characters. For Gerry, winning and success are all that matters. Because he has achieved little success, he has no faith in himself and has always drifted through life. For Giuseppe, adherence to moral values is more important than achieving outward success, and it is these values which enable him to retain his self-respect. Because of these differences in character and outlook, the two men's relationship is a difficult one. Beneath their differences, however, they also have a deep love for one another; Gerry is persuaded to confess to the bombing, after the police have failed to obtain a confession through bullying and violence, by the threat that his father will be killed if he does not. Later, Gerry's love for his father is strengthened by the realisation that although the older man is physically frail, his religious faith and self-belief enable him to cope with the injustice of his plight.Daniel Day-Lewis has been much praised for his performance as Gerry, and he was certainly good, if at times too showy. For me, however, the real star was Pete Postlethwaite as the long-suffering but dignified Giuseppe. The strongest scenes were those between Gerry and Giuseppe; the weakest were those when Gerry, in prison, befriends Joe McAndrew, an IRA man who claims actually to have planted the Guildford bomb. McAndrew is an invented character, and psychologically this did not seem likely; Gerry was, after all, as much a victim of the bomb as those killed and injured by it. Had there been no bomb, there could have been no conviction, wrongful or otherwise, for planting it. Moreover, by associating himself with the IRA's cause, even temporarily, Gerry, although legally innocent, makes himself seem morally guilty.There were other things that did not ring true. I was unsure why Giuseppe's lawyer thought that Inspector Dixon, the policeman who originally investigated the crime, would be responsible for deciding whether her ailing client should receive compassionate parole, or why so much attention was paid to Gerry's alibi that he was in London on the night of the bombing. As the bomb would have had a delayed-action timer, he could easily have returned before it exploded; the ""Horse and Groom"" pub (I used to live in Guildford) is only a short walk from the station, about half an hour by train from London. (The brutal and corrupt Dixon is another invented character; the name may refer ironically to the popular British TV show, ""Dixon of Dock Green"", which featured an honest and decent ""bobby"" named Dixon).It surprises me that some have criticised the film as being ""pro-IRA"". If one were setting out to make a pro-IRA propaganda film, one would not make it about the Guildford bombing, an event in which the IRA cold-bloodedly murdered several innocent civilians without warning. Nor does the film ignore the IRA's violence towards the Irish Catholic community it supposedly represents. At the time of the Guildford bombing, Gerry is living in London, having been forced to flee Northern Ireland by IRA threats; like most terrorist organisations it has a sternly moralistic attitude to all crimes other than those committed by its own members and punishes with mediaeval severity those who, like Gerry, are guilty of petty larcenies. The fact that the ""Four"" and the ""Seven"" were undoubtedly treated unjustly by the British authorities does not retrospectively justify the IRA's crimes of which they were wrongly accused.The film does not attempt to be a comprehensive statement about the Northern Ireland situation- the Unionist community, for example, is not even mentioned. Indeed, given the complexities of that situation, and the even greater complexities of Irish history from which it springs, it would not be possible to make such a statement in a film. Nevertheless, ""In the Name of the Father"" is a very good film, both as a study of father-son relationships and as a warning of the possibilities for injustice inherent in any criminal justice system. 7/10 A goof. In the early scenes, set in 1974, Gerry, while driving along London's Lower Thames Street passes a set of orange and white barriers designed to stop vehicles from entering ""The City"" (London's central financial district). These barriers did not exist in 1974; they were erected following a later IRA bombing campaign",name father son,although considerable liberties have been taken with historical facts this film is based

,In the Name of the Father and the Truth,"Jim Sheridan's astonishingly fantastic 'In the Name of the Father' tells the brutally direct story of a wrongfully accused family who are tortured into making a false confession and imprisoned by the British justice system. Sheridan has a way of telling his stories where he gets straight to the point and does not fear to show the reality of the situation while keeping us viewers at the edge of our seats. The film is based on Gerry Conlan's autobiography where Daniel Day-Lewis plays the central character. Sheridan effectively portrays Gerry and Giuseppe's struggle and fight against injustice and his portrayal of the corrupt British justice system is frightening. Just the idea that people could get away with such things in a country like the UK is chilling and Sheridan skillfully brings that across on screen. Terry George's brilliant screenplay with rich characters and solid dialogues forms a good backbone for the film. I also liked how the humour was infused in a modest dose as not to interfere with the intensity of the story. There are some excellent performances. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a suitably explosive performance as he breathes fire into the role while Pete Postlethwaite is sublime and equally outstanding as Gerry's father, Giuseppe. Though father and son do have issues to fight over, it is Giuseppe who is Gerry's conscience and Postlethwaite's heartbreaking act really touches the heart. Emma Thompson holds her own and she is simply excellent. The rest of the cast do a superb job (watch out for Tom Wilkinson in a bit role). The soundtrack fits the mood of the film and the cinematography is good, especially in the prison sequences, where it creates that feeling of claustrophobia which gets stronger after Gerry is alone in his cell. I have liked all of Sheridan's ' films that I have seen so far and 'In The Name Of The Father' is another remarkable film from this fine director. It is a difficult movie to watch due to some disturbing themes and scenes (though most of them are rather suggestive it is the idea behind that sends chills down the spine) but it is definitely worth watching.",name father truth,jim sheridans astonishingly fantastic name father tells brutally direct story wrongfully accused family who are tortured into making false confession imprisoned by british justice system sheridan has way telling his stories where he gets straight point does not fear show reality situation while keeping us viewers at edge our seats film is based gerry conlans autobiography where daniel day lewis plays central character sheridan effectively portrays gerry giuseppes struggle fight against injustice his portrayal corrupt british justice system is frightening just idea that people could get away with such things country like uk is chilling sheridan skillfully brings that across screen terry georges brilliant screenplay with rich characters solid dialogues forms good backbone film i also liked how humour was infused modest dose as not interfere with intensity story there are some excellent performances daniel day lewis delivers suitably explosive performance as he breathes fire into role while pete postlethwaite is sublime equally outstanding as gerrys father giuseppe though father son do have issues fight over it is giuseppe who is gerrys conscience postlethwaites heartbreaking act really touches heart emma thompson holds her own she is simply excellent rest cast do superb job watch out tom wilkinson bit role soundtrack fits mood film cinematography is good especially prison sequences where it creates that feeling claustrophobia which gets stronger after gerry is alone his cell i have liked all sheridans films that i have seen so far name father is another remarkable film this fine director it is difficult movie watch due some disturbing themes scenes though most them are rather suggestive it is idea behind that sends chills down spine but it is definitely worth watching,0.6615497076023393,0.22660818713450293,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,Powerful and Touching,"Name of the Father came out one year before The Shawshank Redemption and is bar none the better film.  Shawshank is a great film but Name of the Father has more of human story to it.  Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor with more potential now than he did when he won his first Oscar for My Left Foot and since then he has never starred in a film which he has acted badly in. Some of the stories have not been amazing but his acting makes up for it.  This was the second time That Daniel Day Lewis and Jim Sheridan have come together to make a film. In all they have done three but Name of the father is by far the best.  Pete Postlethwaite is another example of fine acting as he is the best actor in England since who ever was the last greatest actor.Daniel Day Lewis plays Gerry Conlon who is a seventies hippie who doesn't want to grow up.  He has had so many troubles at home his fatherGiuseppe played by Postlethwaite decides to pack him off to London for his own safety and not become a lost soul amongst the troubles in Belfast. But when Gerry gets there he might as well wish he never went there in the first place as the trouble from Belfast follows him and before you know it a bomb goes off in a pub near to where he is staying and is not long arrested for the bomb along with his friends and family including his father.From there we are taken into this grieving story of strength, hope, tragedy and family. The story between father and son in jail is more touching and compelling than any love story you will ever see because these two men who have never really seen eye to eye are forced to confront each other's feeling and face up to where they stand in the world.  Also Pete Postlewaite reminds me of my own father and my grandfather and yours two. He plays Giuseppe so well so would have thought he was the old guy living next door to you or the man you look up to as a father and spend time with as a granddad.  What you have to remind yourself is that the movie is a true story of the Guilford Bombing and the men who paid the price for it. Whether or not you believe Gerry and Giuseppe were guilty of the Guilford Bomb is not the case in the film as it's more about the characters and there trials and tribulations.One film that will always be remembered in my mind about making a difference with your life not matter where you are in the world.",powerful touching,name father came out one year before shawshank redemption is bar none better film shawshank is great film but name father has more human story it daniel day lewis is great actor with more potential now than he did when he won his first oscar my left foot since then he has never starred film which he has acted badly some stories have not been amazing but his acting makes up it this was second time that daniel day lewis jim sheridan have come together make film all they have done three but name father is by far best pete postlethwaite is another example fine acting as he is best actor england since who ever was last greatest actor daniel day lewis plays gerry conlon who is seventies hippie who doesnt want grow up he has had so many troubles at home his fathergiuseppe played by postlethwaite decides pack him off london his own safety not become lost soul amongst troubles belfast but when gerry gets there he might as well wish he never went there first place as trouble belfast follows him before you know it bomb goes off pub near where he is staying is not long arrested bomb along with his friends family including his father there we are taken into this grieving story strength hope tragedy family story between father son jail is more touching compelling than any love story you will ever see because these two men who have never really seen eye eye are forced confront each others feeling face up where they stand world also pete postlewaite reminds me my own father my grandfather yours two he plays giuseppe so well so would have thought he was old guy living next door you or man you look up as father spend time with as granddad what you have remind yourself is that movie is true story guilford bombing men who paid price it whether or not you believe gerry giuseppe were guilty guilford bomb is not case film as its more about characters there trials tribulations one film that will always be remembered my mind about making difference with your life not matter where you are world,0.474390243902439,0.27296747967479673,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Some Reflections On My Country,"(English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:)Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling ""hang these Irish bastards"", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said ""I wonder why you are not charged as treason"". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted.But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are ""in the business"". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying ""silence is the most terrifying weapon"". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.",some reflections my country,english is my second language so please excuse my language problems yes i cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers window yes daniel day lewis pete postlethwaite were great actors but other than that what impressed me most was complete change attitudes public between two trials at first audience court were yelling hang these irish bastards they were throwing all their hatred guildford four even judge said i wonder why you are not charged as treason they were biased cheated by prosecutes who fabricated lies cater public because loss 5 lives needed someone be responsible but after 15 years when truth was presented public went parade they plead court free four they wanted right wrong they were becoming rational they felt innocent so they acted but this is not what happens here china government is never transparent public media is censored so that cases like guildford 4 especially if it is injustice will never be known general public unless you are business because public is banning first hand information people are unaware governments wrongdoings even if they are aware there is almost nothing they can do party monopoly corruption all lead this so they kept silent pretending nothing ever happened i once read book saying silence is most terrifying weapon today i have admit this fact but i want say plea all my fellow citizens pretending be deaf doesnt mean that there is no voice society be heard they are merely sunk indifferent public so please pay attention politics events taking place courts maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans then march streets efforts individuals could gather really make change,0.4091859716859716,0.07765444015444016,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Terrorism hurts everyone.,"In watching this fine film, on idea kept running though my mind. That being terrorism often hurts the innocent much more than the declared enemy. In the Name of the Father is a powerful, well-acted drama about terrorism and injustice. And also the love one man feels for his father. Some of the events in this film are factual, and others are not. Despite some liberties taken with history, the film still makes a strong point, however.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry Conlon, a young man falsely accused along with several other friends and family members, of bombing a London pub in 1974. The bombing, performed by the IRA, killed a few persons and wounded several others. Conlon and his friends just happen to be near by when the bombing takes place. Through police torture, Conlon and his best friend confess to the crime, thinking a trial will exonerate them. Trouble is, there had been so many recent bombings that the legal system in Britain was just crying out for a scapegoat. Conlon and four friends are given life sentences. Several members of Conlon's family are also given stiff jail sentences. Even his own father who seems to be the most righteous and kind person imaginable and who never set foot in England at all during the time of the bombing!The film starts out like a shot from a cannon, as we see just how violent and chaotic Blefast was during the early seventies. Just living a normal life looked impossible. If the British troops weren't after you, then the IRA members were. The film also scores when we see Conlon head off to London to presumably make a better life for himself. He and a friend force themselves into a commune and enjoy a brief period of free love and decadence. The film gets very heavy once Conlon is arrested and tortured. And the last hour detailing his time behind bars is just plain somber. We watch his father just sort of waste away with him behind bars while an aggressive lawyer (Emma Thompson) fights to get them out. Pete Postletwaite is exceptional as Gerry's father, and seeing him grow sicker and weak is very difficult for the viewer. The film tries to shift gears down the stretch and show how Conlon has become determined and more radicalized, but these scenes are nothing spectacular. Even the conclusion seems a little anti-climatic, but at least we see some justice finally get done. The acting is very, very good. Lewis is as good as ever, and nobody looks out of their league. There are some historical liberties taken. Gerry and his father never actually lived in the same cell, for instance. Overall, this film will stick with you, though.In watching this film, one cannot help but feel for the victims of terrorism. I have personally not much knowledge of the conflict between the IRA and Britain, except to say that I'm well aware of how long and deep the scars run between the English and Irish peoples. That said, there is simply no excuse for terrorism. Look at how many victims that pub bombing created. Not only those who perished or were injured. That act of terror sent several innocent people to jail and ruined their lives! The British legal system is certainly to blame for sending the wrong people to jail, but would this have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests, but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests! Will we ever all learn to get along on this planet?8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",terrorism hurts everyone,watching this fine film idea kept running though my mind that being terrorism often hurts innocent much more than declared enemy name father is powerful well acted drama about terrorism injustice also love one man feels his father some events this film are factual others are not despite some liberties taken with history film still makes strong point however daniel day lewis plays gerry conlon young man falsely accused along with several other friends family members bombing london pub 1974 bombing performed by ira killed few persons wounded several others conlon his friends just happen be near by when bombing takes place through police torture conlon his best friend confess crime thinking trial will exonerate them trouble is there had been so many recent bombings that legal system britain was just crying out scapegoat conlon four friends are given life sentences several members conlons family are also given stiff jail sentences even his own father who seems be most righteous kind person imaginable who never set foot england at all during time bombing film starts out like shot cannon as we see just how violent chaotic blefast was during early seventies just living normal life looked impossible if british troops werent after you then ira members were film also scores when we see conlon head off london presumably make better life himself he friend force themselves into commune enjoy brief period free love decadence film gets very heavy once conlon is arrested tortured last hour detailing his time behind bars is just plain somber we watch his father just sort waste away with him behind bars while aggressive lawyer emma thompson fights get them out pete postletwaite is exceptional as gerrys father seeing him grow sicker weak is very difficult viewer film tries shift gears down stretch show how conlon has become determined more radicalized but these scenes are nothing spectacular even conclusion seems little anti climatic but at least we see some justice finally get done acting is very very good lewis is as good as ever nobody looks out their league there are some historical liberties taken gerry his father never actually lived same cell instance overall this film will stick with you though watching this film one cannot help but feel victims terrorism i have personally not much knowledge conflict between ira britain except say that im well aware how long deep scars run between english irish peoples that said there is simply no excuse terrorism look at how many victims that pub bombing created not only those who perished or were injured that act terror sent several innocent people jail ruined their lives british legal system is certainly blame sending wrong people jail but would this have even happened if ira had not bombed that pub similar situation can be seen middle east today radical muslims look strike out at western interests but their actions often hurt scores more other muslims than any actual western interests will we ever all learn get along this planet 8 10 stars hound,0.40699751386498373,0.07882721361637027,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
8.0,Will stir your soul and disturb you,"In 1974 a London pub in the town of Guildford was hit by I.R.A. activists with a terrorists bomb, and no warning was given. Five people were killed and several others maimed and injured in a tragedy which sent shock waves through a then terrified and outraged public who demanded police bring the culprits to justice.Director and co-writer Jim Sheridan (scripting with Terry George) brings us the story of a group of young people from Ireland who were brought forward by police to face the charges of murder that related to the bombing. They were unceremoniously tried and found guilty, then sentenced to between fifteen years and life. Pleading their innocence to an unsympathetic jury and public had got them nowhere, so they were left to fight for their freedom from the inside.As father and son Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon, both Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis give passionate and outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship and the battle to prove their innocence. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance too as lawyer Gareth Peirce, the woman who has taken up the appeal. All other cast members are impressive.Sheridan presents a highly charged, emotional drama which tells a horrifying tale in what is a black period in Irish and English history that continues even today. While he perhaps could have shown us more of the people's reaction and the feeling of the time, he instead concentrates on the Conlon's plight and their never ending fight for justice. Due credit must also go to Jim Sheridan for keeping what would have to be an incident and an issue that is close to his heart, very evenly balanced, as both sides are portrayed as equally guilty of terrible and unspeakable acts.Backed up by some very good cinematography, editing and set direction, ""In the Name of the Father"" is certainly a movie that will stir your soul and disturb you. It is truly frightening what men in power are capable of, and even more frightening are the devastating effects they can have on so many people's lives.Saturday, June 18, 1994 - Greater Union MelbourneDirector Jim Sheridan's account of one of the most ruthless bombings undertaken by the IRA is jam-packed with emotion. The tragic, moving story of how the ""Guildford Four"" lost their freedom, and fifteen years of their lives, for something they were never a part of makes for a most upsetting and aggravating film.The powerhouse performances from leads Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite are sensational, as is Emma Thompson's showing as compassionate lawyer Gareth Pierce.Not seeing this film would almost be as grave an injustice as was that which befell these innocent people.Monday, June 12, 1995 - Video",will stir your soul disturb you,1974 london pub town guildford was hit by i r activists with terrorists bomb no warning was given five people were killed several others maimed injured tragedy which sent shock waves through then terrified outraged public who demanded police bring culprits justice director co writer jim sheridan scripting with terry george brings us story group young people ireland who were brought forward by police face charges murder that related bombing they were unceremoniously tried found guilty then sentenced between fifteen years life pleading their innocence unsympathetic jury public had got them nowhere so they were left fight their freedom inside as father son giuseppe gerry conlon both pete postlethwaite daniel day lewis give passionate outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship battle prove their innocence emma thompson gives strong performance too as lawyer gareth peirce woman who has taken up appeal all other cast members are impressive sheridan presents highly charged emotional drama which tells horrifying tale what is black period irish english history that continues even today while he perhaps could have shown us more peoples reaction feeling time he instead concentrates conlons plight their never ending fight justice due credit must also go jim sheridan keeping what would have be incident issue that is close his heart very evenly balanced as both sides are portrayed as equally guilty terrible unspeakable acts backed up by some very good cinematography editing set direction name father is certainly movie that will stir your soul disturb you it is truly frightening what men power are capable even more frightening are devastating effects they can have so many peoples lives saturday june 18 1994 greater union melbournedirector jim sheridans account one most ruthless bombings undertaken by ira is jam packed with emotion tragic moving story how guildford four lost their freedom fifteen years their lives something they were never part makes most upsetting aggravating film powerhouse performances leads day lewis postlethwaite are sensational as is emma thompsons showing as compassionate lawyer gareth pierce not seeing this film would almost be as grave injustice as was that which befell these innocent people monday june 12 1995 video,0.5666608594657375,-0.020301974448315923,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,History and Court Drama,"A man (Daniel Day-Lewis)'s coerced confession to an IRA bombing he did not commit results in the imprisonment of his father as well. An English lawyer fights to free them.This film is a great combination of history and court drama. Sometimes both mix very nicely (as with the Nuremberg trial) and sometimes they do not. Here, we get a nice glimpse at the IRA in Ireland without dwelling on it too much and also get the true story of a family that was wronged by the state for their alleged involvement in terror.Ireland today is not the same place it was a generation ago, but it is not so far removed that this story is ""distant history"" and not important.

8.0,Incredible father and son story,"It's 1974. The IRA bombs a pub in Guildford, England. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an aimless petty thief. His father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) is a straight-arrow soft-spoken man. He and his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) are in London staying with hippies. They leave the flat when the pub bombing happens. A prostitute drops her keys and Gerry breaks in. The parliament passes the Prevention of Terrorism Act which allows for suspects to be held for 7 days. Gerry, Paul and others are arrested and coerced into false confessions. Giuseppe and other relatives are also implicated. The actual bomber Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and tells the police. However the police refuses to admit its mistake. Gerry befriends Joe in prison while ignoring the peaceful faith of his father. Joe becomes the leader of the prison as Giuseppe declines in health. British attorney Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson) works to free the falsely imprisoned. After Joe burns the lead guard, Gerry saves him and turns on Joe.This is a meticulous telling of a compelling life wrongly convicted. It's a bit up and down at times. The first trial is not the most compelling. The results are preordained and not that compelling. The most compelling is the father son relationship. When Joe get into the middle, it's a great turn in the story. These are two great performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite. The two of them in prison is a terrific movie filled with emotions and character growth.

10.0,A powerful story with one of the best performances of all time.,"An emotionally wrenching and immensely powerful true story of an innocent man who is put in prison for fifteen years, after being forced by interrogators to sign a confession out of the threat that they'd kill his father if he didn't, and this man's fight to clear his name and his father's. Due to an incident with the IRA, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) moves to London and after a chance opportunity to rob a prostitute he returns to his home in Belfast, coincidentally the day after a huge bombing committed by the IRA in London. His best friend, who was with him that night, Paul Hill is arrested and after being forced to confess with a gun in his mouth he lists Conlon and two other friends as members of the IRA. Now known as the Guildford Four, these innocent people were all sentenced to very lengthy jail sentences and, after painful torture, the government plants false accusations on members of Conlons' family including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). Gerry has to deal with pent-up aggression that he has built up against his father for years while also trying to survive in a British prison as an accused IRA member.Even after Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and confesses to the police that he was behind the Guildford bombing and the people they have in prison were innocent, Gerry and Giuseppe remain in prison suffering more and more by the day. Eventually Giuseppe begins working with Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) to investigate their case and prove the innocence of the Conlons and the other members of the Guildford Four. After Giuseppe dies of natural causes, Gerry gains a new drive to prove their innocence and takes over the task of working with Gareth. The film is a powerful character study of a man put under unimaginable circumstances and has the discipline to rise up and, along with Pierce, prove the innocence of not only himself but of his father and the other three members of the Guildford Four. It's an immensely heart-wrenching, emotional story that had me in tears several times throughout.Highlighting this sensational film is Daniel Day-Lewis who further proves that he is the greatest actor of all time and delivers what I believe is the best performance of his career. Taking on the role of Gerry Conlon requires the ability to subtly flow from a naive, immature young man to a disciplined adult working to clear the name of his father. Along that journey there are several highly emotional scenes that could have felt melodramatic or silly if another actor were portraying the man, but Day-Lewis brings a power to Conlon that no one else could. His brilliance is unparalleled. Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson also deliver fantastic performances that rank among the best of the 90s. In the Name of the Father is a phenomenal film that studies the torture that one man had to go through due to the government and the journey he took to clear his name and the name of his father. It's the best film of 1993, in my eyes and Day-Lewis' portrayal is very high among the best performances of all time.",powerful story with one best performances all time,emotionally wrenching immensely powerful true story innocent man who is put prison fifteen years after being forced by interrogators sign confession out threat that theyd kill his father if he didnt this mans fight clear his name his fathers due incident with ira gerry conlon daniel day lewis moves london after chance opportunity rob prostitute he returns his home belfast coincidentally day after huge bombing committed by ira london his best friend who was with him that night paul hill is arrested after being forced confess with gun his mouth he lists conlon two other friends as members ira now known as guildford four these innocent people were all sentenced very lengthy jail sentences after painful torture government plants false accusations members conlons family including his father giuseppe pete postlethwaite gerry has deal with pent up aggression that he has built up against his father years while also trying survive british prison as accused ira member even after joe mcandrew don baker is arrested confesses police that he was behind guildford bombing people they have prison were innocent gerry giuseppe remain prison suffering more more by day eventually giuseppe begins working with gareth pierce emma thompson investigate their case prove innocence conlons other members guildford four after giuseppe dies natural causes gerry gains new drive prove their innocence takes over task working with gareth film is powerful character study man put under unimaginable circumstances has discipline rise up along with pierce prove innocence not only himself but his father other three members guildford four its immensely heart wrenching emotional story that had me tears several times throughout highlighting this sensational film is daniel day lewis who further proves that he is greatest actor all time delivers what i believe is best performance his career taking role gerry conlon requires ability subtly flow naive immature young man disciplined adult working clear name his father along that journey there are several highly emotional scenes that could have felt melodramatic or silly if another actor were portraying man but day lewis brings power conlon that no one else could his brilliance is unparalleled pete postlethwaite emma thompson also deliver fantastic performances that rank among best 90s name father is phenomenal film that studies torture that one man had go through due government journey he took clear his name name his father its best film 1993 my eyes day lewis portrayal is very high among best performances all time,0.5263557800224467,0.1741240179573513,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6.0,"An Involving, Sometimes Brutal Story","I might have rated this higher had Emma Thompson had a bigger role. I am a fan of hers, plus I think most people would agree she's an excellent actress, so it was disappointment to see her appear much until the last 15 minutes of the film. That's especially misleading when she gets second or third billing in this movie.Nonetheless, it's an involving true-story of an Irishman, his dad and some of their relatives who are all sent to prison for a bombing they had nothing to do with. Filmmakers LOVE these kind of stories in which they can make their country and police into the bad guys. Here, the British look bad - very bad - as they railroad ""Gerry Conlon"" (Daniel-Day Lewis). The latter makes a convincing hot-headed Irishman, but he's no killer. The tone of the movie softens not in the last half hour as Lewis' character begins to appreciate his father. Until then, it's a rough film that is not always easy to watch and hear because of the accents, some police brutality and corruptness and general group of nasty characters.By the way, despite the billing, Pete Postlewaite is the second star of the film.

9.0,Stunningly well told story.,"In 1974 the Irish Republican Army bombed two public houses in Guildford, England-The Horse & Groom and the Seven Stars. 5 people were killed and 65 people were seriously injured. During the wave of public hatred for all things Irish, the police round up Belfast rogue Gerry Conlon and his mate Paul Hill and interrogate for 7 days with brute force to obtain a confession... This is Gerry Conlon & the Guildford 4's story.This is real powerful stuff that thankfully is directed with careful hands. Director Jim Sheridan is equal in his demonizing of the police and the IRA here because it's crucial for us to focus on the Guildford 4. Focus on the Conlon family, for they are victims of injustice when they have no political, or nationalistic affiliations. He centres in on the relationship between Gerry & his father Guiseppe as they find themselves both wrongly imprisoned. It's that family heartbeat that drives this film on, and it's testament to the makers talents that it never comes across as maudlin, it's all very potent and is the films major axis point.Based on a true story the picture has a finale that will not surprise anyone, but come the last reel you feel emotionally drained, you have come thru the mangler, and myself personally felt both joy and anger in equal measure.

9.0,Well worth seeing...but I'd sure love to see a follow-up,"I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film.The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around.

10.0,'In the Name of the Father': a moving masterpiece,"'In the Name of the Father' is a compelling portrayal of the harrowing ordeal faced by Gerry Conlon, his family and friends, who were wrongfully imprisoned for the Guildford Pub bombing in the 1970s. The film is skilfully manipulated to show a myriad of contrasts and juxtapositions, such as when Gerry is being tortured and interrogated in his cell, the police in the hallway are unconcerned as they celebrate someone's birthday with a cake.The framing of shots and camera angles used emphasise the helplessness Gerry and the others experience. There is also a particularly moving scene in which prisoners show their respect when Gerry's father dies by dropping flaming material from their windows, like a waterfall of burning tears.The soundtrack uses music which is carefree or haunting in all the right places, perfectly mirroring the scenes and adding to the mood of the film. The themes of injustice and corruption are heightened through irony in the dialogue, and are representative of the problems faced by Irish Catholics in the 1970s and beyond.'In the Name of the Father' is a beautifully constructed film which is a credit to the actors, direction and production crew.I challenge you not to be moved by this film.",name father moving masterpiece,name father is compelling portrayal harrowing ordeal faced by gerry conlon his family friends who were wrongfully imprisoned guildford pub bombing 1970s film is skilfully manipulated show myriad contrasts juxtapositions such as when gerry is being tortured interrogated his cell police hallway are unconcerned as they celebrate someones birthday with cake framing shots camera angles used emphasise helplessness gerry others experience there is also particularly moving scene which prisoners show their respect when gerrys father dies by dropping flaming material their windows like waterfall burning tears soundtrack uses music which is carefree or haunting all right places perfectly mirroring scenes adding mood film themes injustice corruption are heightened through irony dialogue are representative problems faced by irish catholics 1970s beyond name father is beautifully constructed film which is credit actors direction production crew i challenge you not be moved by this film,0.5670068027210885,0.37176870748299323,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.27}"
7.0,Law is not the same as justice,"Based on the true story of Gerry Conlon who in 1974 was falsely accused of blowing up an IRA bomb in an English pub, being tortured and coerced into signing a confession of a crime he did not commit, resulting in his imprisonment along with his father. Some of his friends and family members were also falsely accused of criminal association and bomb making.After 15 years he was able to prove his innocence with the help of an untiring lawyer, proving also that the law (which is not the same as justice) can be corrupted by greed, indifference and prejudice.All the performances in this film are of great level, the soundtrack makes it even more emotional and it is a film that I recommend seeing even if just once, only to have a better understanding of the historical and social context - within the same topic, see also Bloody Sunday (2002).",law is not same as justice,based true story gerry conlon who 1974 was falsely accused blowing up ira bomb english pub being tortured coerced into signing confession crime he did not commit resulting his imprisonment along with his father some his friends family members were also falsely accused criminal association bomb making after 15 years he was able prove his innocence with help untiring lawyer proving also that law which is not same as justice can be corrupted by greed indifference prejudice all performances this film are great level soundtrack makes it even more emotional it is film that i recommend seeing even if just once only have better understanding historical social context within same topic see also bloody sunday 2002,0.45686274509803926,0.04019607843137254,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,Powerful Cinema!,"A powerful intro and a stylish ending! The story is so well told and so realistic that you're bound to get involved in the conflict and the case. The direction is superb and the acting is superior. Daniel Day- Lewis is a true chameleon, he's flawless in adopting to Irish culture & accent in the same way he's unflinching as native American in Gangs of New York. His acting earned half a star extra from me for the movie!With some heart-wrenching, tear-jerking and hatred intimidating one- liners, I just couldn't help but fall in love with the movie. I rate it higher than 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Highest recommendations!A wee list of awesome one-liners: ""I'm a free man and I'm going out of the front door"" ""They ought to take the word 'compassion' out of the English dictionary"" ""You're not looking me in the eye when you're speaking to me"" ""I don't understand your language. 'Justice.' 'Mercy.' 'Clemency.' I literally don't understand what those words mean."" ""From all the places the English tried to rule, they've been beaten to be moved out."" ""I will fight on.

6.0,About the dangers of giving into your fear and anger,"October 1974, London. Young Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) gets arrested by the police. They claim he is an IRA (Irish Republican Army) terrorist and to blame for the bombing in Guildford that killed five people. Gerry maintains that he's innocent, but the police and the people of Britain are hungry for blood. The film is based on real events.As you can imagine, the film is anything but congratulatory towards the society and the justice system of the 70s. The film focuses heavily on Conlon's own personal experiences before and after the bombing, but the film takes it time to get the licks in.Daniel Day-Lewis has earned a reputation as one of the great names in cinema and watching this movie you can certainly see why. It all feels authentic, from the quiet rage to desperation to just giving up, if not outright snapping. I also really liked the performance given by Pete Postlethwaite as Giuseppe, Gerry's father.A heavy movie and makes one appreciate how one has managed to grow in relative peace and quiet. Sure modern Europe has had its own upheavals, but nothing quite like this.If I had to name a negative, I would say that the film is a bit episodic, like many biographical films tend to be. It's better than most I've seen, but the film has to jump around in time a lot and these transitions are not quite as graceful as they perhaps could have been.Still, an interesting movie and a great watch for all fans of historical drama.",about dangers giving into your fear anger,october 1974 london young gerry conlon daniel day lewis gets arrested by police they claim he is ira irish republican army terrorist blame bombing guildford that killed five people gerry maintains that hes innocent but police people britain are hungry blood film is based real events as you can imagine film is anything but congratulatory towards society justice system 70s film focuses heavily conlons own personal experiences before after bombing but film takes it time get licks daniel day lewis has earned reputation as one great names cinema watching this movie you can certainly see why it all feels authentic quiet rage desperation just giving up if not outright snapping i also really liked performance given by pete postlethwaite as giuseppe gerrys father heavy movie makes one appreciate how one has managed grow relative peace quiet sure modern europe has had its own upheavals but nothing quite like this if i had name negative i would say that film is bit episodic like many biographical films tend be its better than most ive seen but film has jump around time lot these transitions are not quite as graceful as they perhaps could have been still interesting movie great watch all fans historical drama,0.47322163433274544,0.22275132275132276,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
