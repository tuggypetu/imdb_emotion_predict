10,Ghilli!,"Am an ardent Vijay fan. I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.It has all the regular clich√©s that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.Kabbadi. His friends to fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain, which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can make one dance. And above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle. Perfect.The director doesn't give any chance for the audience to loosen up. He just goes on from one nail on the head to the next. And one can see the lighter side of Vijay in this film which he rarely executes.All said.....This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come....",ghilli,am ardent vijay fan i have never seen another movie his which is as good as this it has all regular clich s that one can expect commercial entertainer hero who is bad studies but star his forte i e kabbadi his friends fill comedy quota heroine life death situation villain which i say is best ever portrayed by protagonist high octane chase action sequences music that can make one dance above all that perfect storyline keep all above factors within enjoyable circle perfect director doesnt give any chance audience loosen up he just goes one nail head next one can see lighter side vijay this film which he rarely executes all said this movie was will be perfect many years come,0.467724358974359,0.3475,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10,Gilli Gets 2 Thumbs Up!,"If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli ""Okkadu"" you will find this to be very similar in story line, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh. Although this is a remake of ""Okkadu"" you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film, Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. A few negatives were when Vijays character slaps Trishas character for going to buy a present for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end. Good action and songs make this an all around great movie I recommend it.I give it a 10/10, one of the best I have seen.",gilli gets 2 thumbs up,if you have seen telugu version gilli okkadu you will find this be very similar story line but gilli has different songs takes place tamil nadu not andra pradesh although this is remake okkadu you will find that vijay trisha make this unique film vijay trisha make great pair few negatives were when vijays character slaps trishas character going buy present him he never apologizes she still stays with him end good action songs make this all around great movie i recommend it i give it 10 10 one best i have seen,0.472,0.35750000000000004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10,An amazingly fast paced and exciting movie,"The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to Cricket) in India. The use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish, as it signifies one who is sharp, fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way.Ghilli is one of the best movies for Vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. The movie never slacks for a moment, and keep you always with some exciting action. The movie is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple. A rich landlord tries to covet a beautiful girl in his town, and his unquestionable power and authority, prevents the girl from seeking a justice. The hero tries to rescue her and the majority of this movie portrays the week in which all this action happens.A very exciting movie and though the story is nothing new, the director and the actors receive praise for the full-paced action.",amazingly fast paced exciting movie,word ghilli actually means small sharp wooden game instrument that is used game called ghilli danda precursor cricket india use word as nickname principal character is stylish as it signifies one who is sharp fast can hurt badly when rubbed wrong way ghilli is one best movies vijay it is unrivaled its pace action movie never slacks moment keep you always with some exciting action movie is set madurai chennai its story core is simple rich landlord tries covet beautiful girl his town his unquestionable power authority prevents girl seeking justice hero tries rescue her majority this movie portrays week which all this action happens very exciting movie though story is nothing new director actors receive praise full paced action,0.510309443642777,0.08523569023569025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10,Mother of all commercial movies.,"17/04/2004, a golden day for the whole of cinema industry. Ghilli is the best among the other best movies vijay has ever acted. There are innumerable hits and blockbuster vijay has given but this will be the best among that, this is remake of okkadu the telugu movie but if you watch both the movies, ghilli outshines okkadu, Dharani has tweaked the screenplay, added different scenes here in ghilli which is some n times betrer than okkadu, okkadu is also a very good film but ghilli has outperformed it, all the actors and Trisha has done an award winning show and this movie gives you many nostalgic moments and that romantic track in the last 45 minutes will make this movie an evergreen movie, if there is a baasha for rajini, then here is ghilli for Thalapathy Vijay. Perfect must watch movie. The only negative aspect of this movie is that there is some over the top action stunt in the first fight of the movie but other fights are very realistic and awesome when compared to some lame fight sequences in okkadu.",mother all commercial movies,17 04 2004 golden day whole cinema industry ghilli is best among other best movies vijay has ever acted there are innumerable hits blockbuster vijay has given but this will be best among that this is remake okkadu telugu movie but if you watch both movies ghilli outshines okkadu dharani has tweaked screenplay added different scenes here ghilli which is some n times betrer than okkadu okkadu is also very good film but ghilli has outperformed it all actors trisha has done award winning show this movie gives you many nostalgic moments that romantic track last 45 minutes will make this movie evergreen movie if there is baasha rajini then here is ghilli thalapathy vijay perfect must watch movie only negative aspect this movie is that there is some over top action stunt first fight movie but other fights are very realistic awesome when compared some lame fight sequences okkadu,0.5109722222222223,0.2886111111111111,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.24}"

10,A very edge of the seat thriller,"Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career.... As I had not seen the Telegu movie so I could enjoy this movie even more.The story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay who had come to play a Kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies. The movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end. Vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player. Trisha,Ashish Vidyarthi,the bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently. A special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie Prakashraj.The villain's character has been properly etched out and prakashraj has portrayed it very well. Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt sympathy for the villain in the end. The dialogue ""Hi Chellam"" has really caught on with the masses. The music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage all over..Dharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world.",very edge seat thriller,ghilli is best movie vijay one biggest hit his career as i had not seen telegu movie so i could enjoy this movie even more story is about girl wanting escape clutches local goon who wants forcibly marry her since he is goon so no body is ready help heroine vijay who had come play kabaddi match there sees this decides help her rest movie is how vijay helps her how girl ultimately escapes clutches goon goons fathers political cronies movie has lot edge seat thriller moments will keep viewer engaged till end vijay is as usual very good role kabaddi player trisha ashish vidyarthi bunch vijay friends all have done their job competently special mention has be made about villain movie prakashraj villains character has been properly etched out prakashraj has portrayed it very well surprisingly first time i felt sympathy villain end dialogue hi chellam has really caught with masses music by vidyasagar is brilliant song apadi podu is rage all over dharani has be credited with such nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by general tamil movie audience all over world,0.48158385093167694,0.27936853002070394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8,Play the Game of life...,"Ghillie a remake of the Telugu ""okkadu' is thankfully a clarified version of the original. It packs the same punch and Dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache. A flagging Vijay's career with the entry of the likes of Surya and Vikram on the fray, got the much needed uplift with this movie. This might well prove to be the best movie Vijay has ever been on, considering the choices he has been making since then. The hard-working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alike.The tightly snug script, which runs at, a neck-break speed revolves around Velu, a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of Kabaddi( a popular game among boys in India). The events following the chance encounter with Muthupandi, his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie. Vijay fits as a 'T' into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door.Trisha has more than a stereotyped Tamil heroine mantle to play. The role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble. With limited dialog's, Trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a cover page girl coming-of-age to become a professional actress. Trisha became my personal favorite after this movie.The movie ends on predictable lines, although one has to credit the Director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including Trisha's change in decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter-weight for Vijay's role. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero's armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing.Overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing. I give it a clear 8 out of 10.",play game life,ghillie remake telugu okkadu is thankfully clarified version original it packs same punch dharani true his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style panache flagging vijays career with entry likes surya vikram fray got much needed uplift with this movie this might well prove be best movie vijay has ever been considering choices he has been making since then hard working actor seems have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by industry public alike tightly snug script which runs at neck break speed revolves around velu willful youngster aspiring make mark game kabaddi popular game among boys india events following chance encounter with muthupandi his rescue girl distress how he juggles with aspirations his friends his own forms fulcrum end movie vijay fits as t into role essays subdued believable portrayal boy next door trisha has more than stereotyped tamil heroine mantle play role is far more complex than just girl trouble with limited dialogs trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions subtle vulnerability add color role this is classic case cover page girl coming age become professional actress trisha became my personal favorite after this movie movie ends predictable lines although one has credit director keeping audience guessing many things including trishas change decision leave country prakash raj deserves word praise providing perfect counter weight vijays role his almost indomitable stature role villain apparent chinks heros armor form perfect ploy keeping audience guessing overall this is great movie that deserves at least single viewing i give it clear 8 out 10,0.4652496728078123,0.15189771468841234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10,One of the greatest masala entertainers in Tamil cinema history,"Ghilli is one of the best made entertainers Tamil cinema has ever seen, and is the movie that brought Vijay into stardom. It is easy to remake a blockbuster movie, but to surpass the original is something only a few movies can do, and Ghilli is one of them. Although the general story line is the same as Okkadu, director Dharani had riveting screenplay that made the movie feel more intense and racy. The movie's decision to forego a comedy track was a great move, since Vijay does an excellent job in providing comic relief during his interactions with his family. Prakash Raj's role is extended a little bit more in the Tamil version and he does a great job portraying a menacing villain who will do anything to achieve his goal. Trisha also does a great job as playing a mortified girl who is running for her life. The soundtrack by Vidyasagar is simply iconic with songs like Appadi Podu. Some of the scenes maybe considered ""over the top"" by today's standards, but without a doubt this was a culturally significant movie in Tamil cinema. There really isn't much to complain about this movie since it did well in all areas.",one greatest masala entertainers tamil cinema history,ghilli is one best made entertainers tamil cinema has ever seen is movie that brought vijay into stardom it is easy remake blockbuster movie but surpass original is something only few movies can do ghilli is one them although general story line is same as okkadu director dharani had riveting screenplay that made movie feel more intense racy movies decision forego comedy track was great move since vijay does excellent job providing comic relief during his interactions with his family prakash rajs role is extended little bit more tamil version he does great job portraying menacing villain who will do anything achieve his goal trisha also does great job as playing mortified girl who is running her life soundtrack by vidyasagar is simply iconic with songs like appadi podu some scenes maybe considered over top by todays standards but without doubt this was culturally significant movie tamil cinema there really isnt much complain about this movie since it did well all areas,0.6305555555555555,0.35815972222222214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.37}"
