,A movie that will last,"""Million Dollar Baby"" has great characters, but it doesn't glorify them. It has a wonderful story, but it never tries to impress you. The photography, score and direction is superb, but never distracting. What this movie is, if I have to call it something, is passion. Passion for film-making, passion for storytelling, passion for its characters, passion for its actors, and passion for its story and the means at which it will go to tell it. Amazing.Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns a messy boxing gym which is populated, mostly, by downbeat losers who he spends some time training. He runs it with his friend and former student Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who now lives contently at a room in the gym. One day a young woman named Maggie (Hilary Swank) walks in, looking for a manager and trainer. Frankie shafts her immediately (""girly, tough ain't enough""). Frankie has bigger things on his hands. He's managing a fighter who has a shot at a title bout.But Frankie is old and weathered and not an appealing manager, so the fighter leaves him. Frankie is broken by this; it is another in a long line of rejections and separations. We can tell that, at this time in his life, he only gets really close with those he's training (Scrap is the only exception). We can tell that his loneliness  and a bit of persuasion from Scrap  cause him to agree to teach Maggie. Teach, that is the agreement, not manage. But, by the end of the film he will have devoted his life to her.So the rest of the story follows these two people. There is no real 'plot' that you could describe in a trailer because it is constantly changingit is not the inspiring underdog story you may think of it as. No, what it's 'about' is these characters, and how they react to the circumstances around them, which change with each scene.Narrating the story is Scrap, speaking like he's looking back to a time long ago when everything has passed. His voice seems flat, deadpan, but there is a working of subtle sorrow in it. Scrap is a sad human being, he sees himself as the result of missed opportunities in the past, and so he spends his time helping the others, offering them his wise advice, with a tone of deadpan humor and even cockiness. Scrap knows what should be done, and what will happen regardless, and he is sort of okay with everything, in a sort of passive way. But the man also knows what's right and he has a deep, inner strength which is displayed in one scene in particular where you just have to cheer. It is an intriguing character, and personally I think it's Freeman's best performance.And Eastwood's best too. He is an elderly man; some might say too elderly to still be working. After all, most people are retired by his age. But if you had to guess when you're watching this film, you would never, ever say the man is seventy-four. You would say something closer to the sixties, because the man has such amazing energy and dedication, and above all, he has talent. It's been forty long years since ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and film has come a long way, and so has this man. At seventy-four, passed all those years as an action hero, nearing what's could be the end of his career, Eastwood has made his best movie. I really, really hope he has time to make many more.As for Swank, well, she must have found something big that she shared with her character, because this is not acting, it is existing. Swank is Maggie. That's all there is too it. This could be the movie she will be remembered for.So, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a masterpiece. I saw it last night when it opened in my city, and everyone else was seeing ""White Noise"", and I was shaking my head. Everyone who is even remotely interested in movies should see this one, just so they can know how movies are supposed to be made. I'm trying to think, and there is not a single thing here where Eastwood went wrong. The acting, directing, writing, score, cinematographythey all accomplish precisely what they're supposed to with sublime perfection. Many of these aspects will certainly receive Oscars and all of them should.You may cry through this film, you may cheer. Whatever the case, you will love it.9/10.",movie that will last,million dollar baby has great characters but it doesnt glorify them it has wonderful story but it never tries impress you photography score direction is superb but never distracting what this movie is if i have call it something is passion passion film making passion storytelling passion its characters passion its actors passion its story means at which it will go tell it amazing frankie dunn clint eastwood owns messy boxing gym which is populated mostly by downbeat losers who he spends some time training he runs it with his friend former student eddie scrap iron dupris morgan freeman who now lives contently at room gym one day young woman named maggie hilary swank walks looking manager trainer frankie shafts her immediately girly tough aint enough frankie has bigger things his hands hes managing fighter who has shot at title bout but frankie is old weathered not appealing manager so fighter leaves him frankie is broken by this it is another long line rejections separations we can tell that at this time his life he only gets really close with those hes training scrap is only exception we can tell that his loneliness bit persuasion scrap cause him agree teach maggie teach that is agreement not manage but by end film he will have devoted his life her so rest story follows these two people there is no real plot that you could describe trailer because it is constantly changing it is not inspiring underdog story you may think it as no what its about is these characters how they react circumstances around them which change with each scene narrating story is scrap speaking like hes looking back time long ago when everything has passed his voice seems flat deadpan but there is working subtle sorrow it scrap is sad human being he sees himself as result missed opportunities past so he spends his time helping others offering them his wise advice with tone deadpan humor even cockiness scrap knows what should be done what will happen regardless he is sort okay with everything sort passive way but man also knows whats right he has deep inner strength which is displayed one scene particular where you just have cheer it is intriguing character personally i think its freemans best performance eastwoods best too he is elderly man some might say too elderly still be working after all most people are retired by his age but if you had guess when youre watching this film you would never ever say man is seventy four you would say something closer sixties because man has such amazing energy dedication above all he has talent its been forty long years since fist full dollars film has come long way so has this man at seventy four passed all those years as action hero nearing whats could be end his career eastwood has made his best movie i really really hope he has time make many more as swank well she must have found something big that she shared with her character because this is not acting it is existing swank is maggie thats all there is too it this could be movie she will be remembered so million dollar baby is masterpiece i saw it last night when it opened my city everyone else was seeing white noise i was shaking my head everyone who is even remotely interested movies should see this one just so they can know how movies are supposed be made im trying think there is not single thing here where eastwood went wrong acting directing writing score cinematography they all accomplish precisely what theyre supposed with sublime perfection many these aspects will certainly receive oscars all them should you may cry through this film you may cheer whatever case you will love it 9 10,0.4506929637526653,0.1381366974650557,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,It Doesn't Get Better Than This,"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life. It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank. Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",it doesnt get better than this,im not sure clint eastwood shouldnt have just retired after making million dollar baby because films dont get any better than this or more poignant maybe clint was influenced by career his young co star hillary swank when swank got oscar boys dont cry it was said that it was pity she reached such dazzling pinnacle acting that it wasnt possible top it she might not have topped it but she certainly equaled it million dollar baby every sense word clint is certainly beyond days being action hero no more dirty harrys or man with no name films him his seventies but playing frankie dunn as senior citizen hes put coda his career with role that leaves those iconic parts dust million dollar baby is generational love story but not romance not hardly that sense clint is lonely old man alienated what family he has left which happens be daughter involved running his gym where prize fighters train boxing is integrated now women do participate against each other be sure but it certainly wasnt so when eastwood was starting so it was fateful day indeed when maggie fitzgerald played by hillary swank showed up learn fine points pugilism im sure that swank took some points character brandon teena playing maggie fitzgerald its not issue sexual identity swank but both characters come this white trash background both yearn something more life there are dozens sports stories involving men women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill only difference million dollar baby is that boxing was not open women until recently use that phrase another recent film classic swank completes eastwood she gives him family hes lost even if its ever so briefly he provides strong father figure that she lacked her life it all ends so horrifically tragic that i cant say more but that its here where even frozen medusa would thaw out tears at powerful performances eastwood swank million dollar baby won four seven oscars it was nominated 2004 it won best picture best director clint eastwood hillary swank just as she did boys dont cry just blew out competition best actress morgan freeman who was eastwoods friend live gym manager trainer swank copped best supporting actor award its he who narrates million dollar baby hes chronicler unfolding tragedy i suppose moral story is never settle mediocrity always strive your personal best even if it ends bad you havent really lived unless you live that way family doesnt necessarily have have related genes this film will be classic hundreds years now we can all learn some life lessons million dollar baby,0.4766830870279147,0.19775432900432904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,A Punch In The Stomach,"I don't know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about to see a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze. Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through ""Pale Rider"" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie to them, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even ""Boys don't Cry"" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's a compliment Mr. Eastwood.

8.0,Superb!,"Clint Eastwood is a legendary film personality. I am a great fan of his. As an actor, I had my reservations with him, but as a storyteller, I have truly inhaled him. 'Million Dollar Baby' is amongst his finest films, a superb film, that almost reaches a Landmark level!About a hardened trainer/manager works with a determined woman in her attempt to establish herself as a boxer. 'Million Dollar Baby' begins with some humor, then it improves itself into becoming a motivational punch, but ends as a dry and depressing saga. I adored almost everything about the film, except the final 20-25 minutes. The culmination is very depressing. In fact, one just doesn't imagine it would have to end this way! But in all fairness, this one is a winner! Eastwood's understanding to the subject is objective and that's biggest plus point. Tom Stern's Cinematography is splendid. Joel Cox's editing is razor-sharp.In the acting department, Hilary Swank delivers a Knock-out performance. She is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman is wonderfully restrained. Eastwood's performance, is a pure of example, of apt multi-tasking. Jay Baruchel as Danger, is flawless. Anthony Mackie is his usual self. Brian F.

10.0,"Unforgettable, Touching, Human, Realistic, Sad, Spectacular  One of the Best Dramas I Have Ever Seen","Yesterday I finally saw the great Oscar winner of 2005, and I can say that ""Million Dollar Baby"" really deserves the awards of best film, director, lead actress and supporting actor, and even the prize of lead actor in the hands of Clint Eastwood would not be a mistake of the Academy: Ben Kinsley and Jamie Foxx were great, but in a whole I would have given the award to Clint Eastwood.The story is very simple and real: Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a poor thirty-one years old waiter from the very lower classes and with a dysfunctional loser family, decides to make a difference through the box. She convinces the experienced hardened box trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to couch her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who sees her potential as a boxer. Frankie has a problem of relationship with his daughter, and practically adopts Maggie along her career, until she is seriously wounded in a fight for the championship and he has to take a decision.This unpleasant and sad theme, in the hands of another director, might have become corny. But the awesome Clint Eastwood deals with such touching story without final redemption, very realistic, making a future unforgettable classic in the genre. The characters and the dramatic situation are perfectly developed, and in the end, the viewer becomes sad, but never depressed. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Menina de Ouro"" (""Golden Girl"")",unforgettable touching human realistic sad spectacular one best dramas i have ever seen,yesterday i finally saw great oscar winner 2005 i can say that million dollar baby really deserves awards best film director lead actress supporting actor even prize lead actor hands clint eastwood would not be mistake academy ben kinsley jamie foxx were great but whole i would have given award clint eastwood story is very simple real maggie fitzgerald hilary swank poor thirty one years old waiter very lower classes with dysfunctional loser family decides make difference through box she convinces experienced hardened box trainer frankie dunn clint eastwood couch her be her manager with support his old partner eddie scrap iron dupris morgan freeman who sees her potential as boxer frankie has problem relationship with his daughter practically adopts maggie along her career until she is seriously wounded fight championship he has take decision this unpleasant sad theme hands another director might have become corny but awesome clint eastwood deals with such touching story without final redemption very realistic making future unforgettable classic genre characters dramatic situation are perfectly developed end viewer becomes sad but never depressed my vote is ten title brazil menina de ouro golden girl,0.5655075187969926,0.1969298245614035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Big girls don't cry,"If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk, to see ""Million Dollar Baby"", perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood is past year.Mr. Eastwood has that rare quality in choosing an odd story to bring to the screen. With this film he accomplishes what could be, perhaps, the best movie about boxing in history. In the first place, the story by F. X. Toole, in which the movie is based, is an odd choice. We have seen, so far, men boxers, but there is a world out there where women boxers compete in this sport that is not well known, or not commonly seen. The adaptation by Paul Haggis is excellent.""Million Dollar Baby"" has a rhythm of its own, seldom seen in boxing formula pictures. Thanks to Tom Stern almost black and white cinematography, this sordid world of second class gyms in the poor areas of the inner city, makes the film more interesting in its texture. Enhancing it all is the great musical score that Mr. Eastwood, a jazz enthusiast, has created. Music has always complimented Mr. Eastwood's work, but never in such a way as in this movie.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.Frankie Dunn, is a man who has trained boxing champions. He is a man at odds with himself. He has demons within him that are tearing away at his soul. We watch him going to mass on a daily basis, but does that qualify him as a devout Catholic? Not according to Father Horvak, who sees a troubled soul in search of redemption.Frankie's letters comes back, returned from a daughter that wants nothing to do with him. Frankie, at the beginning of the film, loses the services of one his better boxers because a richer competitor is willing to pay the fighter much more. Frankie keeps the older Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris employed in the gym because he feels guilty in having let this former boxer down at the highest point of Scrap's career.Into this world comes Maggie Fitzgerald. She is a young woman who wants to make it as a fighter; she comes from a white trash background and everything is against her. The only reason she has been allowed in the all-male gym is because she has paid six months worth of membership. We watch Maggie as she struggles on her own without any help from Frankie, the man she would like to interest in coaching her. Frankie realizes there is potential in this young woman, who he sees on a daily basis practicing, and he relents. Maggie proves she follows his instructions well. Then we watch her progress as she wins fight after fight until the million dollar fight with the vicious title holder.The ironic twist toward the end of the movie arrives out of nowhere; it shakes us up because it was totally unexpected. It makes Frankie and Maggie become father and daughter. Because of the guilt he feels in his own life, Frankie does the right thing in accepting the responsibility of the situation.The ending is the only thing that feels a bit manipulative in the film, although it's handled with a lot of taste, as it would have been worse in the hands of another, less capable director. The only other complain is that Mr. Eastwood speaks in a whisper, which distracts from what is going on, as we strain our ears to catch every nuance of the brilliant dialog. Also, the voice over by Morgan Freeman's character is at times, unintelligible.This is a film totally dominated by Clint Eastwood. As an actor, he brings to the role total credibility as the tormented soul inside Frankie. Hilary Swank makes a brilliant Maggie, the ambitious girl that gets much more than what she bargained for. Ms. Swank has the best moment of her career after her work in ""Boys Don't Cry"". Working with the right elements, Ms. Swank is an actress that works with little gestures to achieve her input in the character she is playing.Morgan Freeman is excellent as the beaten Scrap, a man who ""could have been a contender"". He underplays this character with sensational results. Brian O'Byrne, a theater actor who has been seen in two important plays this year in the New York stages, makes an impression as Father Hovark, who seems to understand Frankie. Margo Martindale is convincing as Maggie's mother.Sometimes it takes a lot for a film to be good. All the right elements were gathered by Clint Eastwood for this movie. It makes one wonder what will his next project be, or if he can surpass the milestone he created with ""Million Dollar Baby"".",big girls dont cry,if anyone had doubts about genius clint eastwood they should run not walk see million dollar baby perhaps best movie that came out hollywood is past year mr eastwood has that rare quality choosing odd story bring screen with this film he accomplishes what could be perhaps best movie about boxing history first place story by f x toole which movie is based is odd choice we have seen so far men boxers but there is world out there where women boxers compete this sport that is not well known or not commonly seen adaptation by paul haggis is excellent million dollar baby has rhythm its own seldom seen boxing formula pictures thanks tom stern almost black white cinematography this sordid world second class gyms poor areas inner city makes film more interesting its texture enhancing it all is great musical score that mr eastwood jazz enthusiast has created music has always complimented mr eastwoods work but never such way as this movie if you havent seen film please stop reading now frankie dunn is man who has trained boxing champions he is man at odds with himself he has demons within him that are tearing away at his soul we watch him going mass daily basis but does that qualify him as devout catholic not according father horvak who sees troubled soul search redemption frankies letters comes back returned daughter that wants nothing do with him frankie at beginning film loses services one his better boxers because richer competitor is willing pay fighter much more frankie keeps older eddie scrap iron dupris employed gym because he feels guilty having let this former boxer down at highest point scraps career into this world comes maggie fitzgerald she is young woman who wants make it as fighter she comes white trash background everything is against her only reason she has been allowed all male gym is because she has paid six months worth membership we watch maggie as she struggles her own without any help frankie man she would like interest coaching her frankie realizes there is potential this young woman who he sees daily basis practicing he relents maggie proves she follows his instructions well then we watch her progress as she wins fight after fight until million dollar fight with vicious title holder ironic twist toward end movie arrives out nowhere it shakes us up because it was totally unexpected it makes frankie maggie become father daughter because guilt he feels his own life frankie does right thing accepting responsibility situation ending is only thing that feels bit manipulative film although its handled with lot taste as it would have been worse hands another less capable director only other complain is that mr eastwood speaks whisper which distracts what is going as we strain our ears catch every nuance brilliant dialog also voice over by morgan freemans character is at times unintelligible this is film totally dominated by clint eastwood as actor he brings role total credibility as tormented soul inside frankie hilary swank makes brilliant maggie ambitious girl that gets much more than what she bargained ms swank has best moment her career after her work boys dont cry working with right elements ms swank is actress that works with little gestures achieve her input character she is playing morgan freeman is excellent as beaten scrap man who could have been contender he underplays this character with sensational results brian obyrne theater actor who has been seen two important plays this year new york stages makes impression as father hovark who seems understand frankie margo martindale is convincing as maggies mother sometimes it takes lot film be good all right elements were gathered by clint eastwood this movie it makes one wonder what will his next project be or if he can surpass milestone he created with million dollar baby,0.5003365421128578,0.18871207374496848,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"

8.0,Swank! Eastwood! Freeman!,"It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged ""Million Dollar Baby."" My favorite scenes were the early sequences in which Maggie (Swank) visits the dowdy boxing gym and co-opts Eastwood's crusty boxing trainer Frankie into becoming her mentor. Along with the veteran, retired boxer Eddie, played by Freeman, the performances were as electric as the Ali shuffle.In the overall arc of the story of ""Million Dollar Baby,"" there were three extraneous subplots: (1) Frankie's visits to church and his talks with the priest; (2) the story of the mentally-challenged young man named Danger, who appears in the gym and is taunted by the boxers; and (3) Maggie's family members introduced in two scenes filled with such vulgarity that much of the film's hard-earned credibility was lost. Not only would the film have worked effectively without the subplots, it would have been a much better film without them.While Eastwood's direction was superb, much credit should also go to the designers, especially the stylish work with lighting. I cannot recall a film as dimly lit as this one, and the subdued lighting contributed substantially to the characters and mood evoked in this sensitive film.

10.0,This film made me think...,"The SPOILER from ""Million Dollar Baby"" is perhaps one of the least best-kept secrets in movie history. Most people know what the big twist is in the film, but in case you are one of the few who doesn't know what it is, I have marked this review as ""contains spoiler""--just in case! This film was directed by Clint Eastwood and he also directs--and he has an incredibly great track record over the past couple decades in these capacities--such as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Gran Torino""--so I knew I had to see this film. I am very glad I did...though I must admit it tore me up emotionally watching the movie. This is not a criticism, but actually a complement. That's right. Too often, movies have nothing to say and don't take any risks--and this film clearly takes risks and has a lot to say. So, when a film like this gets me crying, it's not at all a bad thing.The first 2/3 of the film is a boxing film. Yes, it's well-acted with Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman and Eastwood at their best. But, it's still only a boxing film--a feel-good boxing movie. However, the up and coming boxer (Swank) is unexpectedly paralyzed in the ring-and from then on the film really is at its best and darkest. It asks the poignant questions ""is assisted suicide okay?"" and ""do we have an innate right to die?""--especially in cases where there is no apparent quality of life. It's an important moral and ethical question that most people avoid and films almost never address--and I am glad they created a scenario where you feel very torn. It's hard to just categorically say that taking a life in such a situation is immoral--and this moral ambiguity made the film for me. Because of this, unlike most film, it has staying power. I can imagine that thousands or millions of viewers had their beliefs challenged and many were spurred on by this film to have discussions with friends and loved ones about this debate. Few films will provoke you like ""Million Dollar Baby""--this, combined with a great script and great acting, make this one of the best films of the decade and I can easily see how it won the Best Picture Oscar.By the way, it's not at all a huge criticism, but I felt that the fight scene with the spinal injury could have been handled a bit better. Having the opponent being even more vicious than Clubber Lang from ""Rocky III"" was a bit silly, as she would have been disqualified about 30 seconds into a real boxing match. It was a bit over the top. But, considering how perfect the film is otherwise, this should be overlooked...except for cinema freaks like myself!",this film made me think,spoiler million dollar baby is perhaps one least best kept secrets movie history most people know what big twist is film but case you are one few who doesnt know what it is i have marked this review as contains spoiler just case this film was directed by clint eastwood he also directs he has incredibly great track record over past couple decades these capacities such as unforgiven gran torino so i knew i had see this film i am very glad i did though i must admit it tore me up emotionally watching movie this is not criticism but actually complement thats right too often movies have nothing say dont take any risks this film clearly takes risks has lot say so when film like this gets me crying its not at all bad thing first 2 3 film is boxing film yes its well acted with hillary swank morgan freeman eastwood at their best but its still only boxing film feel good boxing movie however up coming boxer swank is unexpectedly paralyzed ring then film really is at its best darkest it asks poignant questions is assisted suicide okay do we have innate right die especially cases where there is no apparent quality life its important moral ethical question that most people avoid films almost never address i am glad they created scenario where you feel very torn its hard just categorically say that taking life such situation is immoral this moral ambiguity made film me because this unlike most film it has staying power i can imagine that thousands or millions viewers had their beliefs challenged many were spurred by this film have discussions with friends loved ones about this debate few films will provoke you like million dollar baby this combined with great script great acting make this one best films decade i can easily see how it won best picture oscar by way its not at all huge criticism but i felt that fight scene with spinal injury could have been handled bit better having opponent being even more vicious than clubber lang rocky iii was bit silly as she would have been disqualified about 30 seconds into real boxing match it was bit over top but considering how perfect film is otherwise this should be overlooked except cinema freaks like myself,0.5346320346320347,0.26251082251082253,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"

I have to admit, I had my doubts. I'm not really into boxing movies, exception: Raging Bull. But so many people told me that this was a great movie and it was. Hilary Swank, what a performance! This movie makes you feel as if anything can happen. ""I got what I needed"" she says to Clint Eastwood. Clint and Hilary together were absolutely perfect. They made a great team. Clint really did a great job expressing his doubts at first but believing in Hilary, it was truly inspirational.Morgan Freeman is a remarkable actor. I'M SO HAPPY HE WON FINALLY! Even though I feel sometimes his roles are typical, he's the disrespected man, but has knowledge and helps people, he's really good at it.I really enjoyed this movie, but just to let you know, it is a tear jerker. So you might want to have a box of Kleenex next to you. This is a wonderful film that everyone should watch.

10.0,Another Subtle Story by Clint Eastwood,"Three people carrying their own injuries and baggage meet and form an unlikely friendship that slowly becomes familial. Frankie is a man who has lived his entire life in the service of boxing but for reasons left unknown, has an estranged relationship with his daughter, so he has little else to do but be at the boxing gym and train. Eddie is one of his better boxers, a quiet man who can still throw a punch, and who lost an eye in an ill-fated match. Though these two men have a close-knit friendship Frankie still bears tremendous guilt over Eddie's loss. And now, a girl of all people -- Maggie -- wants Frankie to train her. She has nothing going for her, she knows it, and boxing is a way out. While at first Frankie sees no future for her -- she's 31 and has no experience -- he gives in and decides to train her to become the best female fighter ever... until tragedy arrives and gives their lives an unexpected left turn that will change them forever.What could have been a feminist's answer to ROCKY becomes something different, revelatory. Clint Eastwood, a film director that chooses to direct his films in a deliberate pace more akin to late-night jazz, takes F. X Toole's short story and re-shapes it into visual poetry that unfolds into a tight tapestry which by the end of the film will have stirred many emotions with nary a manipulative hand in sight. Clint Eastwood finds a quiet note with his performance as Frankie, the man who could have been a curmudgeon but becomes a surrogate father to Maggie. His final words to her, in Celtic, are whispered in such a fashion, yet convey an immense gravity. Maggie herself is a complicated character: her life is boxing, she has become to symbolize the sport, and in doing so she's achieved so much in a world where all she would have been is white trash. She has a family who thumbs their noses at her career yet want her money. However, she is not an aggressive woman. If anything, she is polite, humble, respectful even when she shouldn't be. Hilary Swank strikes every note in her own rendition of the character: a soft spoken fighter who is faced with a horrific turn of events and must relinquish her love of sports. Morgan Freeman's performance is also of note, mainly because much of it happens off-screen: his measured voice, the one who tells the story, evolves into one who brings much needed closure later on.I felt that the film spoke to me for most of its run. Maggie's story was especially compelling (even if a little predictable) but what resonated with me were the reactions of Eddie and Frankie who have less 'action' and more 'reflection'. This is a much better film than MYSTIC RIVER in the way that much of the focus is on the three leads' bonding as a quasi-family in a world that doesn't care about people like them. It takes its time, then captures your full attention, and before you know it, you are immersed in these three lives because these are people you could meet in your lifetime. And that makes a great film, especially when about the little people who are looking for that special place to live out their final years.",another subtle story by clint eastwood,three people carrying their own injuries baggage meet form unlikely friendship that slowly becomes familial frankie is man who has lived his entire life service boxing but reasons left unknown has estranged relationship with his daughter so he has little else do but be at boxing gym train eddie is one his better boxers quiet man who can still throw punch who lost eye ill fated match though these two men have close knit friendship frankie still bears tremendous guilt over eddies loss now girl all people maggie wants frankie train her she has nothing going her she knows it boxing is way out while at first frankie sees no future her shes 31 has no experience he gives decides train her become best female fighter ever until tragedy arrives gives their lives unexpected left turn that will change them forever what could have been feminists answer rocky becomes something different revelatory clint eastwood film director that chooses direct his films deliberate pace more akin late night jazz takes f x tooles short story re shapes it into visual poetry that unfolds into tight tapestry which by end film will have stirred many emotions with nary manipulative hand sight clint eastwood finds quiet note with his performance as frankie man who could have been curmudgeon but becomes surrogate father maggie his final words her celtic are whispered such fashion yet convey immense gravity maggie herself is complicated character her life is boxing she has become symbolize sport doing so shes achieved so much world where all she would have been is white trash she has family who thumbs their noses at her career yet want her money however she is not aggressive woman if anything she is polite humble respectful even when she shouldnt be hilary swank strikes every note her own rendition character soft spoken fighter who is faced with horrific turn events must relinquish her love sports morgan freemans performance is also note mainly because much it happens off screen his measured voice one who tells story evolves into one who brings much needed closure later i felt that film spoke me most its run maggies story was especially compelling even if little predictable but what resonated with me were reactions eddie frankie who have less action more reflection this is much better film than mystic river way that much focus is three leads bonding as quasi family world that doesnt care about people like them it takes its time then captures your full attention before you know it you are immersed these three lives because these are people you could meet your lifetime that makes great film especially when about little people who are looking that special place live out their final years,0.4953968253968254,0.09587391774891775,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"

,"One of, If Not, THE BEST Film of the year","Million Dollar Baby, 25th feature directed by masterful storyteller Clint Eastwood, brings the art that is boxing and implants such raw emotion into it, not one person will leave the theatre with a dry eye.Million Dollar Baby tells the story of an old boxing trainer, Frankie, disowned by his daughter, left by his boxer, and has been attending mass almost daily for the past 23 years in the hopes of finding some sort of solitude from the sins he can't seem to forgive himself for. eastwood has never been a more finer actor, who's skills only seem to improve with age. Mr. Eastwood has for so long been honing his acting skills, he disappears into the role of Frankie, played with such remorse, such pain, the audience immediately sympathizes with him over the events that have happened in his life. once he meets Maggie, he tries so hard to not let her in, but due to her strong will to succeed, he gives in, grows and builds a relationship and a love that is so deep, he sees a light at the end of the tunnel, that maybe life is worth living after all. Mr. Eastwood took full control of his character, taking his acting to such depths that it's amazing to think of all the other aspects he put into this masterful film besides his extraordinary acting.Which brings up Hilary Swank, who in the past few years has experienced a bad run of scripts since Boys Don't Cry, again proves to Hollywood that when given the right material, she is absolutely stunning at becoming and knowing her character. Her face is so expressive the film very well could have been carried off of her facial expressions alone, she was so open to what she was feeling. Swank has cemented an Oscar nomination with this performance and quite possibly her second win as well. Just stunning...Which of course also leads to the wonderful Morgan Freeman. How this talented actor has not been recognized for his achievements by the Academy is astounding, as he again turns in a tremendous performance as Scrap, an old boxer Frankie feels responsible for for the loss of his eye. freeman plays the exposition or the narration in this film, and given to any other actor the performance would have been average. Yet Freeman has such a presence, such power on the screen, that he turns a semi-small part and makes it a standout.The score was poignant, thoughtful, and enduring. the screenplay was stunning, the words these characters said to each other, the story, the plot, the list goes on and on. Do not come into this film and expect not to be moved in any way. The film touches you, stays with you, and makes you think of the own decisions you have made in your life and how you've dealt with the consequences.Million Dollar Baby is hands down THE BEST film of 2004, bar non.

10.0,"If you weren't moved by it, you must be mentally challenged.","Clint Eastwood has been directing films ever since the late 80's and has won twice for best picture. The first time was for Unforgiven, which I have to see someday. The second time was for Million dollar baby, which I just finished today. For a while, I thought that Mystic river was his best. But after seeing Million dollar baby, it's official. This is his crowning achievement.Eastwood in his long life has never acted or directed better. I have never been more moved,touched, or tragicly heartbroken by any movie other than Million dollar baby. Maybe My sister's keeper. No, Million dollar baby. I loved the characters so much in this film. Million dollar baby is easily the best boxing movie of all time. Better than Rocky,Raging bull, or any others.Eastwood plays Frank, a boxing trainer, who, as he says in the beginning,""Doesn't train girls"". After lots of persuasion by Maggie(played by 2 time Oscar winner Hillary Swank), he does train her. Maggie wants to be a boxer because she is incredibly broke. So broke, that at the restaurant that she works at, she picks up people's leftovers and eats them for her dinner.The film shows the solace between the two, and it also shows wannabe boxers(such as Jay Baruchel) and has been boxers, like Frank's friend(played by Morgan Freeman) and how gritty the boxing life is.This is such a moving story. All of the characters are so lovable. Lots of the scenes just want to make you stand up and cheer. The film is so sweet,and so touching,and so powerful,and so sad. But yet it's more than that. It's actually well writtenly funny, and extremely entertaining. It's sad to think that this is a true story.I loved all of the characters. Especially Frankie and Maggie. They are so sweet. Eastwood deserved the Oscar that night. He deserved the win, along with Freeman and Swank. Those are three great actors, starring in one great movie.

10.0,It's a knockout ...,"Flawlessly written, acted and directed, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is being hymned and wreathed by the critics as the best film of 2004. They're absolutely right. ""An old master's new masterpiece,"" the NEW YORK TIMES said in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood than anything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself. For once such honey-tongued critical adulation is fully merited. Dark, edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABY represents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid and intelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, the noble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above and apart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. The Boxing Ring As Metaphor For Life is a hoary trope almost as old as Hollywood itself, employed to varying effect in films as diverse as THE CHAMP, GOLDEN BOY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, FAT CITY, ROCKY and RAGING BULL. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. Eastwood the actor is in fine form - a commanding if increasingly weather-beaten presence - as gym owner Frankie Dunn. A case study in loneliness, Dunn's creased face is a map of places you'd rather not go to and disappointment has clearly been a life-long companion. Co-stars Hilary Swank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikely protegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, give what are without question the best performances of their respective careers: deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelming impacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotous fight sequences. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. The canvas-floored square ring becomes the arena in which all three characters confront their various demons, battling for both victory and personal redemption. Paul Haggis' screenplay is itself a masterwork, improving on its source material without betraying the concise but compelling situations and superbly drawn characters found in F.X. Toole's short stories. And, finally, Eastwood the composer's elegiac but unobtrusive score is a minor classic of its kind, a requiem to both lost souls and lost causes.

,Loved The Ride,"Million Dollar Baby is a movie about boxing like Braveheart is a movie about men in kilts riding horses. What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.I read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard. What a beautiful, memorable ride it was.",loved ride,million dollar baby is movie about boxing like braveheart is movie about men kilts riding horses what it is is movie experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty determination talent no talent age youth courage fear fate pain joy both living dying i read reviews million dollar baby expected like it roger ebert can be soft movies because he is plainly big fan but even he does not lightly toss around m word masterpiece yet he drops it mdb justly so story is simple searing gal hilary swank with much heart no experience aspires be champion world she is rocky sports bra grizzled fight trainer manager gym owner clint eastwood reluctantly takes her his best pal wise man assistant morgan freemna stands alongside them as plot unwinds steadily seamlessly picking up speed scene by scene act after act eastwood freeman are artists at top their profession they along with brilliant swank present you very worthy lives three people you will care about remember arena is boxing but it might as well have been boating or baking it is story about values truths that far exceed sports movies i walked into lowes lincoln square theater last night knowing million dollar baby was taking me ride willing hop aboard what beautiful memorable ride it was,0.5439909297052155,0.34920634920634924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Million Dollar Baby Is A Knockout!,"Clint Eastwood always explores the darker side of human nature and the duality of man. His dark hero of Unforgiven, William Munny, tries to repent only to be thrust back into that violent world he knows so well. His regretful Frank Horrigan of In The Line Of Fire and his womanizing Steve Everett of True Crime also want redemption.Eastwood's Frankie Dunn of Million Dollar Baby is the most conflicted, weathered, and vulnerable he's ever played. When he weeps in a darkened church it's like watching a house of cards begin to fall. This is a man whose had a regretful past and can't run away from the curve balls life has thrown at him. Frankie Dunn is like most of us where we eventually get punished for our good deeds.The funny thing is that Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing movie despite the way it's being advertised like a female version of Rocky. Yes, Hilary Swank's Maggie trains to be a boxer under the guidance of Clint Eastwood's Frankie Dunn. Yes, Morgan Freeman is Scrap, Frankie's tough friend and ex boxer. Yes, the bulk of it takes place in a boxing gym. Yes, there are numerous boxing matches. Despite all this it's still not a boxing movie.When you see it you'll be surprised by the utter humanity in the piece. This film runs very deep and you will care for the three main characters. Eastwood gives us something we rarely get in films today. He gives us real people.The film is about the triumph of the human spirit, the emotional world we try to hide from that eventually sucks us all in, our compassionate hearts, and the difficult decisions we face when it comes to those we care about. It's about friendship, trust, and the bonds of the heart that are unavoidable. It is a true masterpiece.Hilary Swank is all fire and guts as Maggie. Her intensity and commitment has guided her to another Academy Award. She knows she's poor, she accepts it, and she pushes forward despite her limitations. This is not to say she can't be hurt. We watch her eyes well up a few times and truly feel her pain despite the fact that she is as tough as they come. Morgan Freeman, who finally won a long overdue and well deserved Oscar, plays Scrap with the perfect combination of toughness and compassion. He knows the situation from every angle and his narration of the film rings true.See this film. It deserves it's accolades because it's about real characters and it's directed with honesty, warmth, and true pain. Clint Eastwood gets better with age and his films reflect the days of real movie making. The sets are simple, the characters are complex, and the story moves in a pace closer to real life than any other director could reach. Eastwood has been called the Hemingway of Film making.

10.0,One of Clint Eastwood's Best Works,"This film is one of Clint Eastwood's best films ever!!! The story is simple but draws you in and never let's go. The characters are simply too thrilling. Hillary Swank steals the show a bit with a sad and brutal story of a very tormented woman's life with incredible power. Enough to bring viewers to tears in fact. Morgan Freeman is great as a supporting actor and he definitely deserves some recognition for his performance. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an Oscar for his excellent directing and own spectacular performance. His role was perfect, creating a strong yet vulnerable character people will embrace. The climax will touch you as his character is given a choice that decides life and death. The score is moving in itself and I simply love this film.",one clint eastwoods best works,this film is one clint eastwoods best films ever story is simple but draws you never lets go characters are simply too thrilling hillary swank steals show bit with sad brutal story very tormented womans life with incredible power enough bring viewers tears fact morgan freeman is great as supporting actor he definitely deserves some recognition his performance clint eastwood himself deserves oscar his excellent directing own spectacular performance his role was perfect creating strong yet vulnerable character people will embrace climax will touch you as his character is given choice that decides life death score is moving itself i simply love this film,0.6623809523809523,0.33291666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,Fighting in and out of the ring,"Clint Eastwood is really making his mark as a director. In fact, I'd say that he's an even better director than he is (and was) an actor. He took a seemingly slow, passive, uneventful tale of a woman boxer and made it into something deeply moving and mesmerizing. I was easily wrapped into the main characters as they were intriguing and the actors did such a great job. There are rarely fairytale endings in real life, and the writers should be credited for being courageous enough to explore and present a dark ending. We were swept from the joyous emergence of a promising young female boxer who was beating every opponent, to her sudden and tragic fall into the fight of her life on her death bed and the battle with the decision of euthanasia. This movie was so excellent because it could have just as easily been poorly done. With the wrong actors, or wrong director, or wrong writers, this could have been a long sappy drawn out tragedy. I extend my compliments to a movie that made a person that dreads dramas and romance actually stay locked in.",fighting out ring,clint eastwood is really making his mark as director fact id say that hes even better director than he is was actor he took seemingly slow passive uneventful tale woman boxer made it into something deeply moving mesmerizing i was easily wrapped into main characters as they were intriguing actors did such great job there are rarely fairytale endings real life writers should be credited being courageous enough explore present dark ending we were swept joyous emergence promising young female boxer who was beating every opponent her sudden tragic fall into fight her life her death bed battle with decision euthanasia this movie was so excellent because it could have just as easily been poorly done with wrong actors or wrong director or wrong writers this could have been long sappy drawn out tragedy i extend my compliments movie that made person that dreads dramas romance actually stay locked,0.5380952380952382,0.06369047619047623,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,Sure to be a contender for the Academy's Best Picture of the Year,"Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts.",sure be contender academys best picture year,saw million dollar baby manhattan last night clint eastwood one all time most famous actors directors has more than enough money where he could choose pull strings block buster mindless action pictures ala jerry bruckheimer or comic books or hell his twilight years he could just lay back enjoy his millions but no he has chosen instead make quieter lower budget heart felt character driven films like unforgiven true crime mystic river now million dollar baby world is better place it eastwood uses his multiple talents make films that have something valuable say emotionally powerful million dollar baby he tells allegorical tale boxing subtly express themes hope redemption sacrifice persistence belief ones self movie emphasizes that failure is more honorable personally fulfilling trait than never having tried while also frowning upon laziness leeching off others but see movie judge yourself i personally consider great films as ones where i leave theater with better understanding human nature or desire improve world by even little bit eastwoods latest more than succeeds those counts,0.4698412698412699,0.2629464285714286,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,Lemon Pie and Yeats,"Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise this gem of a film is! I had to force myself to go after the nominations because the trailer was SO BAD. Hilary Swank is totally believable as the trailer park trash dreamer who wants so much to be a professional boxer. The great Morgan Freeman brings elegance to his role as a former boxer / now wise janitor and Clint's gym. Freeman again proves he is the best movie voice over working today (see ""Shawshank Redemption""). As wonderful as Hilary and Morgan are, there is no doubt that this is Clint's (multi) million dollar baby. He directs and stars and writes the music. At almost 75 years old, he can still carry a picture, while not stealing scenes. Yes, the twist in this one smells a bit like a Hollywood chick-flick, but the talented director (Eastwood) never lets it sink to that level. This is a terrific film by a top-notch filmmaker. The story is interesting, funny, dramatic and heart-warming and the acting is truly first rate. Don't let the trailer or the thought of a boxing movie keep you away.",lemon pie yeats,greetings again darkness what pleasant surprise this gem film is i had force myself go after nominations because trailer was so bad hilary swank is totally believable as trailer park trash dreamer who wants so much be professional boxer great morgan freeman brings elegance his role as former boxer now wise janitor clints gym freeman again proves he is best movie voice over working today see shawshank redemption as wonderful as hilary morgan are there is no doubt that this is clints multi million dollar baby he directs stars writes music at almost 75 years old he can still carry picture while not stealing scenes yes twist this one smells bit like hollywood chick flick but talented director eastwood never lets it sink that level this is terrific film by top notch filmmaker story is interesting funny dramatic heart warming acting is truly first rate dont let trailer or thought boxing movie keep you away,0.5158333333333334,0.32499999999999996,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Genuine emotions!,"Or at least it seems like genuine emotions in this masterpiece of a film which incidentally is Eastwood's best drama so far and considering how good Mystic River is that's saying something. The storytelling is both fluent and well paced and all actors involved deliver some of their best work so far which is mainly because Eastwood is so good at bringing out the best in his actors. I think people who have watched this film and Mystic River will agree. Eastwood is a no-nonsense story teller and cuts right through to the bone which means that there aren't many subplots and this is a really good thing in this film because the main story doesn't need a large number of subplots to steal away attention. Also at a running length of 2 hours the film would undoubtedly have been too long if Eastwood had added any more subplots.The acting is as mentioned earlier very, very good. Clint chose to appear in this film himself as he does in many of the films he directs but there is something different about him this time around. Eastwood isn't known as a director who pours his soul out on the screen but in this film he seems to add a few emotions to his range of acting. He is still a tough guy as can be heard from his voice but he is also just a vulnerable old man with an estranged daughter. Its hard to write about his performance without spoiling the film so I'll just say this: This is his most well rounded character to date in spite of the fact that it seems a little far fetched that Eastwood would want to learn Gaelic. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her performance in this film and in my opinion it was well earned. She plays her character in a way so the character becomes almost instantly likable and you cannot help but root for her. This ability to draw the audience in and make them feel is very rare but Swank seems to have mastered it. Overall her performance is impressive. The last notable actor is of course Morgan Freeman who finally won his Oscar. He brings his usual authority and authenticity to the character and while he is ""only"" a supporting character in this film he definitely puts his signature on it with some very moving scenes. The rest of the cast is decent but as the emphasis is on the three mentioned above there is no reason to talk about them further.The script is rather simple but its simplicity is a quality mark. The film takes you in one direction only to take a twist and turn into something completely different and as the audience had just gotten used to the direction the film was going the twist seems like a genuine shock. I'm not telling what the twist is you're just going to have to watch the film and find out for yourself. The dialog is both witty and intelligent and above all it seems real. Believable. And because of the first class acting it feels even better. When I say that the dialog seems real in fact I mean the entire film seems real. Genuine. Everything from the acting to the atmosphere is highly believable and real even though Swank's character's family and the character of Danger lean ever so slightly towards caricature.The film really managed to draw me in and I felt with and for the characters of the film. The characters are the driving factor of the film and luckily the actors who portray them are skilled enough to make them seem real. Eastwood outdid himself in the drama genre with this film which is undoubtedly one of his best. It doesn't seem fair to compare the film to Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) as they are very different films in terms of genre and target group.Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2004 and is deserving of the Oscar it received in the Best Film category as well as the other Oscars it was awarded.9/10",genuine emotions,or at least it seems like genuine emotions this masterpiece film which incidentally is eastwoods best drama so far considering how good mystic river is thats saying something storytelling is both fluent well paced all actors involved deliver some their best work so far which is mainly because eastwood is so good at bringing out best his actors i think people who have watched this film mystic river will agree eastwood is no nonsense story teller cuts right through bone which means that there arent many subplots this is really good thing this film because main story doesnt need large number subplots steal away attention also at running length 2 hours film would undoubtedly have been too long if eastwood had added any more subplots acting is as mentioned earlier very very good clint chose appear this film himself as he does many films he directs but there is something different about him this time around eastwood isnt known as director who pours his soul out screen but this film he seems add few emotions his range acting he is still tough guy as can be heard his voice but he is also just vulnerable old man with estranged daughter its hard write about his performance without spoiling film so ill just say this this is his most well rounded character date spite fact that it seems little far fetched that eastwood would want learn gaelic hilary swank won oscar her performance this film my opinion it was well earned she plays her character way so character becomes almost instantly likable you cannot help but root her this ability draw audience make them feel is very rare but swank seems have mastered it overall her performance is impressive last notable actor is course morgan freeman who finally won his oscar he brings his usual authority authenticity character while he is only supporting character this film he definitely puts his signature it with some very moving scenes rest cast is decent but as emphasis is three mentioned above there is no reason talk about them further script is rather simple but its simplicity is quality mark film takes you one direction only take twist turn into something completely different as audience had just gotten used direction film was going twist seems like genuine shock im not telling what twist is youre just going have watch film find out yourself dialog is both witty intelligent above all it seems real believable because first class acting it feels even better when i say that dialog seems real fact i mean entire film seems real genuine everything acting atmosphere is highly believable real even though swanks characters family character danger lean ever so slightly towards caricature film really managed draw me i felt with characters film characters are driving factor film luckily actors who portray them are skilled enough make them seem real eastwood outdid himself drama genre with this film which is undoubtedly one his best it doesnt seem fair compare film il buono il brutto il cattivo or good bad ugly as they are very different films terms genre target group million dollar baby is undoubtedly one best films 2004 is deserving oscar it received best film category as well as other oscars it was awarded 9 10,0.5127308362369336,0.23550135501355013,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,exquisite and delicate work of art,"Usually there is so much hoopla surrounding films that come at the end of the year, and 80% of them are disappointing when they finally screen. Some of them flying by in colorful shells with technical wizardry but little emotion. Others manage to touch the soul and teach us how to confront the wonderful mystery of life. Eastwood has put together a sensitive study of damaged souls and hope. He gives an opportunity to appreciate life and not to give up in the pursuit of our of dreams.Eastwood, Swank, and the always wonderful Freeman move effortlessly and interact with each other with fantastic precision and grace. It is hard not to think of them as fantastic performers and give them their much deserved dues. In an era when people are so fascinated with quick flashes and light analysis of important material, comes a small film that envelops and doesn't let you go. In my second viewing I felt I discovered more of its richness and grew to appreciate it even more. I truly hope that when Academy Awards (which supposedly honor the most accomplished work of the year), the acting, direction, and every other aspect of this film is recognized accordingly. There has been other phenomenal work out this year, most in small films. Don't let this be a make up year or a year that will eventually be recognized by ""should have been"" remarks.
