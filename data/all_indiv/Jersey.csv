10,What an emotional jersey. Just brilliant peace of work by director..,"What to start with the directors vision or the actors performances. As a 90's kid i know that old days where watching news in durdarshan spider man in the tv after the school. Playing cricket with friends. Those are the best days. By watching the movie i got to recollect those old memories.. To the story a failed man want to try once again his luck by giving his full strength at the age of 36 to show the world what is and what he can do. Man NANI what an actor you are i had to say that i saw only arjun on the screen the way you pulled the character is beyond words.. the scene where "" crying your lungs out in the railway station in loud sound"" kudos to you.. and the directors work of showing cricket in where it is needed not getting away with it, giving important to the emotions, shows his strength of telling a story. And about music Anirudh lifted the movie to whole new level with his commendable Bgm. Songs blended in the movie so well that it doesn't look like a hurdle inbetween like movies we regularly watch in telugu. If haven't mention wbout the kid, shradha, satyaraj garu ot would be a mistake. They stayed in my head as nani, Sarah and murthy garu. After watching i have mixed feelings. I just had a journey with arjun's character i felt his pain, anger, struggle, joy. RARELY WE SEE THESE KIND OF MOVIES AND PERFORMANCES IN TELUGU CINEMA GO AND WATCH IT WITH YOUR FAMILY.

9,Pure Classic. To be watched by every single person.,"One of the best movie in recent times. Director Gautam Tinnanuri has delivered an excellent film and has used his abilities perfectly for his second film too. The screen play for this movie also looks similar as his first movie Malli Raava. Subtle performances by the cast Nani and Shraddha Srinath. Supporting cast Sathya Raj, Praveen etc. have also played their role with so much of life. The emotions between the Father and Son Relation is brought up amazingly. The climax is the Heart of the film. Music Director Anirudh Ravichander has given his one of the best ever songs and beautiful Background Score. Magical Scenes in some important and emotional places. The subtitle of this film ""It is never too late to dream.!"" is brought up beautifully in the climax. The only drawback I feel as a movie freak is the lack of concentration on the cricketing scenes and quite the story becomes a bit predictable. But totally a package of love, emotion, passion, journey. Must Watch Film for everyone.

10,Nani's JERSEY Perfectly Describes That It's Never Late To Chase Our Dreams !!!,"To call Jersey just the story of an ex-cricketer Arjun (Nani) who fights conventions to get selected in the Indian cricket team is a grave injustice to the film, even if that's how it sums itself up. It is also the story of the love of his life Sarah (Shraddha Srinath), who struggles to stay in love with the man he has become. It's the story of assistant coach Murthy (Sathyaraj) who sticks by an orphan through thick and thin, even at his most irrational best, in hope that he will be able to aid him in achieving his dream someday. But, most importantly, it's the story of a father who's so enamoured with his son Nani (Ronit Kamra) that he would do anything to not stoop low in his eyes and get him the birthday gift he always wanted.Despite the multiple threads and three different time frames that connect to Arjun, Gowtam Tinnanuri does a stupendous job of not tangling them all up into a mess. Arjun is an ex-Ranji player, the best right hand batsman of his time and a cocky man who's unfortunately soon grounded by reality. Sarah is the love of his life who marries him against her father's wishes and now struggles to stay in love with the shell he is. The once in love couple now constantly seem at warring ends, but the ray of brightness in their life is their son Nani (Ronit Kamra), whose brings in a refreshing innocence to an otherwise hefty story. And then there's assistant coach Murthy who pushes Arjun to maximise his potential, even when the latter refuses to.Jersey is a beautifully told tale which sees Nani delivering his career's best performance with ease. If he's good as the cocky batsman who knows he's talented, he's doubly good as the man who's constantly beaten by life but refuses to give up. The actor trained and practiced cricket while shooting for the film and it shows in the scenes in which he picks up cricketers' body language with ease. A while into the film, Nani simply ceases to exist and it is only cricketer Arjun you see, someone who's as comfortable on the field as he is on the couch in his living room. The realization of how well he performed especially comes through in key scenes which require him to emote without speaking a word.While Nani also shines through in scenes that require him to play cricket, the scenes between him and his son are the ones that steal your heart. Ronit Kamra nails his performance as the seven year old son who sees his father as nothing less than a superhero. The scenes between them don't just radiate love, but also an understated humour that keeps the film from being too serious. Shraddha Srinath makes an impressive Telugu debut, as a woman who's head-over-heels in love with her husband, but is still not someone who will agree to put up with his carelessness. Sathyaraj breezes through his role as the constant backbone Arjun needs.While Gowtam Tinnanuri really takes the cake in this one, with his stupendous screenplay and narration, Sanu Varghese's cinematography and Anirudh Ravichander's music do their bit to simply pour life into the film. Naveen Nooli too does a good job with the editing, with the film, despite its long runtime and laggy bits, not ending up seeming like a cricket documentary.Watch this one this weekend if you're an ardent fan of cricket, for you will sit on the edge of your seat during the sporting scenes. Watch this one for Nani and the rest of the cast, who will make you fall in love with their characters by the time the end credits roll. But especially watch this one for Gowtam Tinnanuri, for it's not every day that a director manages to pull off a sports drama like this with ease. Jersey will make you laugh, cry and cheer out loud.",nanis jersey perfectly describes that its never late chase our dreams,call jersey just story ex cricketer arjun nani who fights conventions get selected indian cricket team is grave injustice film even if thats how it sums itself up it is also story love his life sarah shraddha srinath who struggles stay love with man he has become its story assistant coach murthy sathyaraj who sticks by orphan through thick thin even at his most irrational best hope that he will be able aid him achieving his dream someday but most importantly its story father whos so enamoured with his son nani ronit kamra that he would do anything not stoop low his eyes get him birthday gift he always wanted despite multiple threads three different time frames that connect arjun gowtam tinnanuri does stupendous job not tangling them all up into mess arjun is ex ranji player best right hand batsman his time cocky man whos unfortunately soon grounded by reality sarah is love his life who marries him against her fathers wishes now struggles stay love with shell he is once love couple now constantly seem at warring ends but ray brightness their life is their son nani ronit kamra whose brings refreshing innocence otherwise hefty story then theres assistant coach murthy who pushes arjun maximise his potential even when latter refuses jersey is beautifully told tale which sees nani delivering his careers best performance with ease if hes good as cocky batsman who knows hes talented hes doubly good as man whos constantly beaten by life but refuses give up actor trained practiced cricket while shooting film it shows scenes which he picks up cricketers body language with ease while into film nani simply ceases exist it is only cricketer arjun you see someone whos as comfortable field as he is couch his living room realization how well he performed especially comes through key scenes which require him emote without speaking word while nani also shines through scenes that require him play cricket scenes between him his son are ones that steal your heart ronit kamra nails his performance as seven year old son who sees his father as nothing less than superhero scenes between them dont just radiate love but also understated humour that keeps film being too serious shraddha srinath makes impressive telugu debut as woman whos head over heels love with her husband but is still not someone who will agree put up with his carelessness sathyaraj breezes through his role as constant backbone arjun needs while gowtam tinnanuri really takes cake this one with his stupendous screenplay narration sanu vargheses cinematography anirudh ravichanders music do their bit simply pour life into film naveen nooli too does good job with editing with film despite its long runtime laggy bits not ending up seeming like cricket documentary watch this one this weekend if youre ardent fan cricket you will sit edge your seat during sporting scenes watch this one nani rest cast who will make you fall love with their characters by time end credits roll but especially watch this one gowtam tinnanuri its not every day that director manages pull off sports drama like this with ease jersey will make you laugh cry cheer out loud,0.579783950617284,0.2640873015873015,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8,Emotional bagger,"An emotional bagger from the Telugu film industry.I think any story that has this format/structure of storytelling from a son's perspective with a twist never fails and a touch of emotional drama is like the chocolate at the end of the ice cream which holds it for a very long time in our hearts.I now understand why Nani is called a natural actor as while watching I felt like watching a neighbourhood guy, it felt just so natural.And not just that but the very best part of this film is its portrayal of the 1980s, which is beautifully delivered via the everyday objects that we really used in those times in very subtle ways, these are the elements that really takes us to those times, of course for the people who've lived in those times. I think no other movie comes even near to this one when it comes to bringing back those nostalgic nesses.The main character of the film was designed nicely. The storytelling from the son's perspective with a voice-over was really good.The only drawback is the design of the heroine character, which was strong enough but maybe it looked like having no strength probably because of Shraddha Srinath, with her poor acting skills, she didn't even get connected to the character. Also, the music & bgm could've been bettered.But, overall it was a very good watch with multiple emotional connections that would emote us.",emotional bagger,emotional bagger telugu film industry i think any story that has this format structure storytelling sons perspective with twist never fails touch emotional drama is like chocolate at end ice cream which holds it very long time our hearts i now understand why nani is called natural actor as while watching i felt like watching neighbourhood guy it felt just so natural not just that but very best part this film is its portrayal 1980s which is beautifully delivered via everyday objects that we really used those times very subtle ways these are elements that really takes us those times course people whove lived those times i think no other movie comes even near this one when it comes bringing back those nostalgic nesses main character film was designed nicely storytelling sons perspective with voice over was really good only drawback is design heroine character which was strong enough but maybe it looked like having no strength probably because shraddha srinath with her poor acting skills she didnt even get connected character also music bgm couldve been bettered but overall it was very good watch with multiple emotional connections that would emote us,0.502816091954023,0.14048850574712643,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"
