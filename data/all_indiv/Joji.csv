8,A Slow Burning Thriller with great BGM,"Joji is the best 2021 Indian film i have watched so far. The script has brilliantly taken certain elements from Shakespeare's Macbeth and used it in rural kerala's setting in it's own unique way. Fahadh proves why he is the talk of the whole country right now by delivering a spectacular performance but it's the background score which made this slow burning thriller so effective. Top tier stuff. That said first hour of it's slightly slow but the music, performances and those beautiful wide angled shots builds the tension very well in it and we as viewer's are aware that something hideous is simmering and it's gonna blow up and it takes it's time in that but when it blows up the last 40 minutes of it are all worth it and makes our skin crawl with uncertainty and tension.

7,Fahadh is to movies what salt is to cooking. You could add every available spice to a dish but without salt its pretty much unpalatable.,"There is this Jason Bateman directed movie called, Bad Words. That was the first time I came across the concept of active actors with a flourishing career trying to direct a movie just to figure out if they will be as good behind the camera as they are in front of it. I still remember the movie coz the kid who plays the lead has done a really good job. However it felt that the idea was to make a movie by spending as little money as possible. In most cases the actor himself invests his own money and the idea is that even if the movie doesn't do well the losses should be as minimal as possible. Recently there was another movie directed by Manoj Bajpai that again seemed to have been made on a shoe string budget.I would say that Joji falls in the same category. It doesnt look like they spend much on the movie but what separates Joji from other movies directed by first time directors is that none of them have Fahadh to boast of. Its like God made Fahadh just to act. If Fahadh acted in RGV ki Aag even that would become a watchable movie.I went in with very high expectations after watching the trailer but it is just about ok as a movie. Its not brilliant like the likes of Maheshinthe Prathikaram or even a Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum. Its just a simple story elevated to a higher level by the brilliant acting all around.I think one of the measure of a good director is his/her ability to get the best out of their cast. Take someone like Nimisha Sajayan for example who cannot act to save her life. If you watched her in Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum you will not be able to tell that she cannot act. However if you watched Oru Kuprasidha Payyan your first thought would be...did this lady win a contest or did they just cast someone randomly off the street.The ensemble cast of Joji are not all actors of the same calibre as a Fahadh. Unnimaya Prasad is someone with a very limited acting range but watching Joji you will not be able to figure it out. Shami Tilakan is another accidental actor who is not even close to being a natural. But if you watched him in Joji you would assume that this guy was born to act. Basil Joseph is another actor who is not a natural when it comes to dialogue delivery. But he is nothing short of brilliant in Joji. The 5-10 mins that Basil Joseph has in Joji is without doubt his best work as an actor. Dileesh Pothen has done a great job of getting the best out of each & every cast member.",fahadh is movies what salt is cooking you could add every available spice dish but without salt its pretty much unpalatable,there is this jason bateman directed movie called bad words that was first time i came across concept active actors with flourishing career trying direct movie just figure out if they will be as good behind camera as they are front it i still remember movie coz kid who plays lead has done really good job however it felt that idea was make movie by spending as little money as possible most cases actor himself invests his own money idea is that even if movie doesnt do well losses should be as minimal as possible recently there was another movie directed by manoj bajpai that again seemed have been made shoe string budget i would say that joji falls same category it doesnt look like they spend much movie but what separates joji other movies directed by first time directors is that none them have fahadh boast its like god made fahadh just act if fahadh acted rgv ki aag even that would become watchable movie i went with very high expectations after watching trailer but it is just about ok as movie its not brilliant like likes maheshinthe prathikaram or even thondimuthalum driksakshiyum its just simple story elevated higher level by brilliant acting all around i think one measure good director is his her ability get best out their cast take someone like nimisha sajayan example who cannot act save her life if you watched her thondimuthalum driksakshiyum you will not be able tell that she cannot act however if you watched oru kuprasidha payyan your first thought would be did this lady win contest or did they just cast someone randomly off street ensemble cast joji are not all actors same calibre as fahadh unnimaya prasad is someone with very limited acting range but watching joji you will not be able figure it out shami tilakan is another accidental actor who is not even close being natural but if you watched him joji you would assume that this guy was born act basil joseph is another actor who is not natural when it comes dialogue delivery but he is nothing short brilliant joji 5 10 mins that basil joseph has joji is without doubt his best work as actor dileesh pothen has done great job getting best out each every cast member,0.5019227513227513,0.24042910052910055,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8,Exciting anti-hero drama,"The theme has been said in various movies. But in here we get to see a very interesting anti-hero angle to it. The central character is one which viewers won't forget, whether they like the whole movie or not.The events and situations escalate at a fast pace which makes it all the more interesting. There are several other characters apart from the protagonist who too have a sinister shade to them. But none of them are as dark as the protagonist.It takes skill to keep the viewers invested in such a story with such a set of characters, and the makers surely have succeeded in it. I was never bored for the entire runtime of the movie.I was a bit disappointed with the ending of the movie. Can't go into details without getting into spoilers.It goes without saying that the cinematography and camera etc are great as usual, given the people who have handled those areas.As far as acting, Fahadh's acting didn't seem like anything new. He has acted here in the same way as in the roles which he came in before. There's no surprising elements in his acting in here. That's not to say his acting was bad in it. It was of course good.Others too mostly did a good job, with Unnimaya Prasad doing a very interesting role. The guy who played the father character was surprisingly very good. But, the guy who came as one of the brothers felt like a miscast.The music resembled the ones you would hear in some melodramatic movies. Maybe it was used as this movie is kind of inspired from Macbeth. The music at times gives an eerie vibe and complements the particular tone of the movie.If you like anti-hero movies which have a serious tone, this one is for you. The character Joji is on the same level as the character Kammaran in Kammara Sambhavam.",exciting anti hero drama,theme has been said various movies but here we get see very interesting anti hero angle it central character is one which viewers wont forget whether they like whole movie or not events situations escalate at fast pace which makes it all more interesting there are several other characters apart protagonist who too have sinister shade them but none them are as dark as protagonist it takes skill keep viewers invested such story with such set characters makers surely have succeeded it i was never bored entire runtime movie i was bit disappointed with ending movie cant go into details without getting into spoilers it goes without saying that cinematography camera etc are great as usual given people who have handled those areas as far as acting fahadhs acting didnt seem like anything new he has acted here same way as roles which he came before theres no surprising elements his acting here thats not say his acting was bad it it was course good others too mostly did good job with unnimaya prasad doing very interesting role guy who played father character was surprisingly very good but guy who came as one brothers felt like miscast music resembled ones you would hear some melodramatic movies maybe it was used as this movie is kind inspired macbeth music at times gives eerie vibe complements particular tone movie if you like anti hero movies which have serious tone this one is you character joji is same level as character kammaran kammara sambhavam,0.5164128464128463,0.12063325563325564,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10,This is why we love Malayalam cinema.,"This is just a general review. I won't reveal any specific details but just share some of my general insights.This film is the perfect reason why the Malayalam Film Industry is considered far superior than Bollywood and other South Indian film industries. This film is firstly a treat to the eye. This level of film making I've seen only in Malayalam films. Yes the cinematography is breathtaking, showing the lush green landscapes of Kerala and the camerawork and all, but the acting is what stands out for me. Fahad Fazil, like what can be said that hasn't already been said about this guy? This guy is a joy to look at. His voice, mannerisms, the way he conveys with his eyes, feels so natural. The guy's a born performer. I'm a fan of his and think he's the best actor I've seen to date in India. He's god damn Brilliant. And so are the other actors. They all are so natural and so amazing. The casting is simply perfect.These guys take care of the technical aspects so well, the end result being a spectacular, technically perfect film. Mallus imo have surely mastered the art of film making.Another thing I appreciate is that there are no unnecessary songs or stuff like that or even Product Placements that can ruin the fun for people like me and make a film hard to be taken seriously. Except for the Jeep lol. But it was quite subtle. The BGM is tense and adds gravitas to the scenes. Splendid job, Joji team.

7,Story lacking in conviction,"Speaking of the director's previous movies - Maheshinte Prathikaaram and Thondimuthal were classes apart.The problem with Joji is there is an element of predictability lingering in the air, right from the start till the very end.Characters have no great depth, all we know about Joji is he is frustrated with his life, but to what level and due to what reason is not clearly conveyed.

10,A Classic Masterpiece.,"Joji is a retelling of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", in a different place, in a different circumstance, with familiar characters. Greed for money and power drives one for mindless actions.Even though the story has been told a million times over 4 centuries, the screenplay for this film is so tightly written, it forces the audience glue their eyes on to the screen throughout the 2hour runtime, keeping every moment engaged. Many characters do come and go in this film, yet Joji is the one that grabs the attention even in places where he is offscreen.Direction of the film is just brilliant. There are scenes where the emotions of character is shown in a frame without dialogues ( Bincy in kitchen with fire beside shows the fire burning inside her).Even the pond is a character in this film. And so is the Airgun.Music of the film is just perfect, far beyond the usual stuff that is used in such films, adding to the ominous and thrilling elements.Dileesh Pothan- Shyam Pushakaran- Fahad Faasil combo proved for the third time, that story, actors, and director are enough to create a masterpiece. Budget is never a limitation. This is a film that stays among the classics of cinema.Baburaj proved that he is an actor beyond his muscular body. Shammi Thilakan utilised the opportunity to show off his prowess. Unnimaya even with a few space in the film did a phenomenal job. All the characters in the film, big and small created an impression including Basil Joseph who stood against the intimidating Baburaj.Dileesh Pothan needs to make more movies.",classic masterpiece,joji is retelling shakespeares macbeth different place different circumstance with familiar characters greed money power drives one mindless actions even though story has been told million times over 4 centuries screenplay this film is so tightly written it forces audience glue their eyes screen throughout 2hour runtime keeping every moment engaged many characters do come go this film yet joji is one that grabs attention even places where he is offscreen direction film is just brilliant there are scenes where emotions character is shown frame without dialogues bincy kitchen with fire beside shows fire burning inside her even pond is character this film so is airgun music film is just perfect far beyond usual stuff that is used such films adding ominous thrilling elements dileesh pothan shyam pushakaran fahad faasil combo proved third time that story actors director are enough create masterpiece budget is never limitation this is film that stays among classics cinema baburaj proved that he is actor beyond his muscular body shammi thilakan utilised opportunity show off his prowess unnimaya even with few space film did phenomenal job all characters film big small created impression including basil joseph who stood against intimidating baburaj dileesh pothan needs make more movies,0.5201190476190476,0.1606547619047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.47}"

6,Another successful adaption of Shakespeare's Macbeth with more family friendly content.,"Joji (2021) : Movie Review -Shakespeare's Macbeth has been adapted many times before and will be adapted many times in future too. From Hollywood's version made by Orson Welles to Japanese Cinema's Throne Of Blood (1957) by Akira Kurosawa to Bollywood's Maqbool (2004) of Vishal Bhardwaj and many more, Macbeth has been made in different industries with different cultural touch. Now, it's Malayalam Cinema making their own version with Joji and expectedly it has different shades to have its own existence. Dileesh Pothan's version is set in more family friendly atmosphere while the crime world is excluded partially. Joji is a successful attempt to create something intense with new methods and it delivers enough for its own consideration. However, it has limited quality assurance which does not match the high expectations (of you have any).Joji is set in a house of Panchel family. Joji, an engineering dropout and the youngest son of a rich family lives with his aspirations of becoming super wealthy. Driven by greed and blind ambition, he decides to execute his plans following an unexpected event in the family which leads to expected bad consequences. Ok, so this one is intense for sure and sort of thriller, not a complete thriller because if its easily predictable nature. The screenplay is little slow while completing the scene which you can already predict and that's exactly how it appears on screen. Thankfully, it doesn't take long runtime to sum up all the events and therefore remains somewhat pacy.Fahad Faasil as Joji delivers a cracking performance and that was expected. He hardly fails to deliver the goal especially in such acting oriented roles. In supporting roles or should I say next leading roles, Baburaj, Mundakayam, Sunny PN, Alister Alex and Unnimaya Prasad are more than fine with theirs limited dialogues. Joji could have had better dialogues as it comes with realistic effects and thrilling mode but all it had to offer was barely average.Let's move towards the best parts of the film, the technical aspects and Direction. Cinematography, editing, background score and direction these four things has literally saved this predictable script with brilliant results all over. The frames captured by Shyju Khalid are eye pleasing and the background score is superbly chilling. Pothan's direction is the best thing about Joji. Without his methodical and intense storytelling Joji would have ended up as a an average flick. Overall, Joji is a fine draft based on legendary Macbeth and also has some of its own identity to be known, but only if you are not expecting too much.RATING - 6/10*",another successful adaption shakespeares macbeth with more family friendly content,joji 2021 movie review shakespeares macbeth has been adapted many times before will be adapted many times future too hollywoods version made by orson welles japanese cinemas throne blood 1957 by akira kurosawa bollywoods maqbool 2004 vishal bhardwaj many more macbeth has been made different industries with different cultural touch now its malayalam cinema making their own version with joji expectedly it has different shades have its own existence dileesh pothans version is set more family friendly atmosphere while crime world is excluded partially joji is successful attempt create something intense with new methods it delivers enough its own consideration however it has limited quality assurance which does not match high expectations you have any joji is set house panchel family joji engineering dropout youngest son rich family lives with his aspirations becoming super wealthy driven by greed blind ambition he decides execute his plans following unexpected event family which leads expected bad consequences ok so this one is intense sure sort thriller not complete thriller because if its easily predictable nature screenplay is little slow while completing scene which you can already predict thats exactly how it appears screen thankfully it doesnt take long runtime sum up all events therefore remains somewhat pacy fahad faasil as joji delivers cracking performance that was expected he hardly fails deliver goal especially such acting oriented roles supporting roles or should i say next leading roles baburaj mundakayam sunny pn alister alex unnimaya prasad are more than fine with theirs limited dialogues joji could have had better dialogues as it comes with realistic effects thrilling mode but all it had offer was barely average lets move towards best parts film technical aspects direction cinematography editing background score direction these four things has literally saved this predictable script with brilliant results all over frames captured by shyju khalid are eye pleasing background score is superbly chilling pothans direction is best thing about joji without his methodical intense storytelling joji would have ended up as average flick overall joji is fine draft based legendary macbeth also has some its own identity be known but only if you are not expecting too much rating 6 10,0.5454574924293234,0.20034281446253271,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7,Prentitious setups throughout than a genuine story.,"I would have given it 6 but it's not that worse though. The biggest issue I got with this is it feels extremely a false setup, trying too hard or pretentious to make it look artsy film and while doing so they kind of lost the story. I mean think of it, why are you watching it and who you rooting for? Joji? Or anyone? And why?I did like the Grandpa character developed and expected more but it's all just style over substance. Even Joji , keep aside who acted it and think, do you really care for him and what for? Even the drunkard guy had some character at one point when he rubs wrong with Priest, each character is half baked, no where building to anything worth rooting for. And the biggest issue is the lack story and genuine intent to tell a story native to the location. It all looks so fake trying to show off rather than be yourself! Sorry I said it.The death of the head of the family doesn't have any authentic emotional impact to anyone of audience or for character to root of what anyone is doing anything. Though surely it's beautifully shot and kind of I want to shine show myself music moments, but it all feels ingenuine, as if someone watched few Iranian, European, Japanese films and took like I want these these shots, and these thriller elements style from movies and just muddled it all up. There is not a single character I was able to emotionally root for even say it's antihero or villain as such.Though acting was pretty good. I have noticed this lately where a streak of ""Influenced"" films in recent times coming out from Malayalam and Tamil films which takes strong inspirations influence from many of foreign films and filmmakers just put it out there as if no one can catch it and think will grab the accolades. I mean nothing wrong is learning from foreign films, but have something genuine rooted for what the society itself offers. It's a pile of garbage if you keep just copy pasting what you learned. Same thing most Industries are doing lately. So did bollywood once and still does and they don't even get where they are making mistake as though like a sugar rush of not seeing the issue. Not to be rude, I just love Shakespearean works but using a play just to spark interest rather than giving genuine adaption to is tough. And societies, cultures, language, people change in different demography. One should understand this. I can't make films watching say Russian films throughout and just imitate say a family drama setup in Goa or anywhere in India. That would come across fake in context to world cinema. That's where many are heading towards.The native story, the tone, the atmosphere we all live in India got it's own style, mannerism which surely can be shown to the world. Surely we can learn form world cinema but just don't copy paste it and call it as unique you know. You can see this nature not just in many recent films but just in cinematography itself you will see this turquoise teal colors and sort of a music which is completely feels not matching to the scenario. Many stories are as such. It's sure good for that time watching, but what are we really doing though? Think of it..Forget all that, because what they tried with all that learning, you know what hurt this movie the most, they lost the sense to tell a compelling story. That's the biggest issue. Overall it's 7 you can give, but it's mostly 5 or 6 for world cinema.If you just have this fan love for Fahaad acting and read Shakespearean work, plays than you might like it, but if you see it as a cinema itself as a whole, you might not really like it and might relate to what I wrote.",prentitious setups throughout than genuine story,i would have given it 6 but its not that worse though biggest issue i got with this is it feels extremely false setup trying too hard or pretentious make it look artsy film while doing so they kind lost story i mean think it why are you watching it who you rooting joji or anyone why i did like grandpa character developed expected more but its all just style over substance even joji keep aside who acted it think do you really care him what even drunkard guy had some character at one point when he rubs wrong with priest each character is half baked no where building anything worth rooting biggest issue is lack story genuine intent tell story native location it all looks so fake trying show off rather than be yourself sorry i said it death head family doesnt have any authentic emotional impact anyone audience or character root what anyone is doing anything though surely its beautifully shot kind i want shine show myself music moments but it all feels ingenuine as if someone watched few iranian european japanese films took like i want these these shots these thriller elements style movies just muddled it all up there is not single character i was able emotionally root even say its antihero or villain as such though acting was pretty good i have noticed this lately where streak influenced films recent times coming out malayalam tamil films which takes strong inspirations influence many foreign films filmmakers just put it out there as if no one can catch it think will grab accolades i mean nothing wrong is learning foreign films but have something genuine rooted what society itself offers its pile garbage if you keep just copy pasting what you learned same thing most industries are doing lately so did bollywood once still does they dont even get where they are making mistake as though like sugar rush not seeing issue not be rude i just love shakespearean works but using play just spark interest rather than giving genuine adaption is tough societies cultures language people change different demography one should understand this i cant make films watching say russian films throughout just imitate say family drama setup goa or anywhere india that would come across fake context world cinema thats where many are heading towards native story tone atmosphere we all live india got its own style mannerism which surely can be shown world surely we can learn form world cinema but just dont copy paste it call it as unique you know you can see this nature not just many recent films but just cinematography itself you will see this turquoise teal colors sort music which is completely feels not matching scenario many stories are as such its sure good that time watching but what are we really doing though think it forget all that because what they tried with all that learning you know what hurt this movie most they lost sense tell compelling story thats biggest issue overall its 7 you can give but its mostly 5 or 6 world cinema if you just have this fan love fahaad acting read shakespearean work plays than you might like it but if you see it as cinema itself as whole you might not really like it might relate what i wrote,0.5225654225654227,0.13186741936741936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.35}"
6,"Well acted, but this movie is not for everyone.","Good acting is necessary but not sufficient quality to make a good film. Joji is a simple film about evil minded children who are willing to kill their own father in order to inherit his property. If you end up watching the time while watching a film, then it means you are not really enjoying it. Joji is one such film. Slow burners are fine as long as things take an interesting turn in the third act of the film, but unfortunately Joji remains a slow and boring film from start to the end. Throughout the film I felt bad for all the parents who probably do have such immoral kids. We are used to watching movies from the hero's point of view, but this film is about the villains, their thought process, and their state of mind. This was perhaps one of the reasons why I could not love this film.",well acted but this movie is not everyone,good acting is necessary but not sufficient quality make good film joji is simple film about evil minded children who are willing kill their own father order inherit his property if you end up watching time while watching film then it means you are not really enjoying it joji is one such film slow burners are fine as long as things take interesting turn third act film but unfortunately joji remains slow boring film start end throughout film i felt bad all parents who probably do have such immoral kids we are used watching movies heros point view but this film is about villains their thought process their state mind this was perhaps one reasons why i could not love this film,0.5892290249433106,-0.056349206349206336,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.14}"
