10,Such an emotional tribute to a wonderful actor.,There is no better way to give tribute to a genuinely amazing actor. The film was pretty emotional and touching. Such natural acting from #Sushanth and #SanjanaSanghi and a brilliant execution from other the cast and crew. The movie indeed had plot holes and rushed up situations but I don't think anyone will notice those stuffs as the movie maintained a emotionally touching storyline and knowing the fact that Sushanth left us made it way more emotional and can't finish the movie without releasing a single drop of tear.,such emotional tribute wonderful actor,there is no better way give tribute genuinely amazing actor film was pretty emotional touching such natural acting brilliant execution other cast crew movie indeed had plot holes rushed up situations but i dont think anyone will notice those stuffs as movie maintained emotionally touching storyline knowing fact that sushanth left us made it way more emotional cant finish movie without releasing single drop tear,0.5466269841269842,0.21686507936507937,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.45, 'Fear': 0.15}"

2,An Objective Review,"Under ordinary circumstances , I would never have watched this film, given that it is an official remake of a film that I would not have watched even in extra-ordinary circumstances. But the unfortunate and untimely demise of Mr. Rajput played some part in impelling me to watch the movie.I solemnly affirm that I tried my best to watch the movie in its entirety ,but failed multiple times,because, the movie, is admittedly quite poorly made. There is no grip in the plot, the dialogues are cheesy or stale,the music and background score is unimaginative and imitative.The movie of rife with jejune sequences,that neither fit in the story nor the cultural setting,where the director decides to insert them. On the whole, one can attribute the lacklustre effort to the director as also the basic story line.I tried my best to not let sentimentality get the better of judgment ,and consequently, I concluded that barring the basic theme of the story, Dil Bechara is a nondescript affair that can be easily avoided.",objective review,under ordinary circumstances i would never have watched this film given that it is official remake film that i would not have watched even extra ordinary circumstances but unfortunate untimely demise mr rajput played some part impelling me watch movie i solemnly affirm that i tried my best watch movie its entirety but failed multiple times because movie is admittedly quite poorly made there is no grip plot dialogues are cheesy or stale music background score is unimaginative imitative movie rife with jejune sequences that neither fit story nor cultural setting where director decides insert them whole one can attribute lacklustre effort director as also basic story line i tried my best not let sentimentality get better judgment consequently i concluded that barring basic theme story dil bechara is nondescript affair that can be easily avoided,0.40438596491228074,0.03859649122807018,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"

1,Sushant Doesn't Need this!!!!,"I didn't know SSR before Kai Po Che, even when he was a huge TV star then. But the moment I saw Kai Po Che's trailer, Promo Songs, I became a fan of him. That's quite rare as many viewers become a fan only after watching a film. Dil Bechara is the last film of Sushant. That's enough reason for fans to watch the icon for one last time on screen. However the film doesn't live upto it's expectations. The filmmaker failed to capture the soul of the story completely.Reasons are listed below:1. Cliched Opening: The film starts with lead actress voiceover narrating Granny's fairytale that's so Cliche. The narration part is very ineffective and fails to build a momentum.2. Screenplay is terrible. It's unnecessarily so fast that characters are forced to be accepted with whatsoever little we know about them.3. Manny's Character was so poorly written. They tried to bring the vintage SRK's flavour to the character that it doesn't make you feel for him whatsoever. In a film like this, the lead characters must be written so carefully as both are suffering from terminal illness. Sushant gave his best. But the writers didn't give him a proper character.4. Supporting Characters were underutilized: Manny's friend JP has more screen time. But his character doesn't make you feel for him despite becoming blind. Manny's Granny is shown barely in the film. The veteran actress'potential was not utilised at all and if given more screentime, it would definitely add a lot to Manny's character.5. The Unfinished Song: Though it was a decent composition...it's not much impactful considering the importance of the song to the entire film. The picturization of the song was also pale. Simply the song doesn't make you crave for more and more as it should do.6. The Cringeworthy Short film: Both lead actors make a short film (supposedly inspired from Rajni films), which is so obnoxious to watch. The worst thing about it is, though it starts as a tribute to Rajni, the makers take it so ludicrously that it ends up as a tribute to SRK and DDLJ.7. Irritating Abhimanyu Veer: When the film isn't going anywhere, I thought, Saif Ali's cameo might create a right impact, forgetting everything happened before. But once he enters, you would feel begging him to leave. His character is so irrational and tests audiences patience. It ends up çreating a worst impact on the film....that if it were not for Sushant, I would've stopped watching it instantly.For some so talented like Sushant... who did terrific job in his previous films, this film is so underwhelming. Anyway, as he already gave us masterpieces before, I was not looking forward for much as a fan.#RIPSushant",sushant doesnt need this,i didnt know ssr before kai po che even when he was huge tv star then but moment i saw kai po ches trailer promo songs i became fan him thats quite rare as many viewers become fan only after watching film dil bechara is last film sushant thats enough reason fans watch icon one last time screen however film doesnt live upto its expectations filmmaker failed capture soul story completely reasons are listed below 1 cliched opening film starts with lead actress voiceover narrating grannys fairytale thats so cliche narration part is very ineffective fails build momentum 2 screenplay is terrible its unnecessarily so fast that characters are forced be accepted with whatsoever little we know about them 3 mannys character was so poorly written they tried bring vintage srks flavour character that it doesnt make you feel him whatsoever film like this lead characters must be written so carefully as both are suffering terminal illness sushant gave his best but writers didnt give him proper character 4 supporting characters were underutilized mannys friend jp has more screen time but his character doesnt make you feel him despite becoming blind mannys granny is shown barely film veteran actresspotential was not utilised at all if given more screentime it would definitely add lot mannys character 5 unfinished song though it was decent composition its not much impactful considering importance song entire film picturization song was also pale simply song doesnt make you crave more more as it should do 6 cringeworthy short film both lead actors make short film supposedly inspired rajni films which is so obnoxious watch worst thing about it is though it starts as tribute rajni makers take it so ludicrously that it ends up as tribute srk ddlj 7 irritating abhimanyu veer when film isnt going anywhere i thought saif alis cameo might create right impact forgetting everything happened before but once he enters you would feel begging him leave his character is so irrational tests audiences patience it ends up reating worst impact film that if it were not sushant i wouldve stopped watching it instantly some so talented like sushant who did terrific job his previous films this film is so underwhelming anyway as he already gave us masterpieces before i was not looking forward much as fan,0.506475155279503,0.012490824392998302,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.42}"
