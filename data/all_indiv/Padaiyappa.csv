10.0,The best of Rajini,"I was utterly disappointed after looking at the rating of the movie - 5 - who are those @#$% who rated this movie. I would give it a straight 10. This was a better movie compared to Chandramukhi (and of course BABA).Here the director has given Rajini ample scope to perform in all three stages of the hero's life. His style, stunts and comedy in the first half. His responsible side after his dad's demise and as a father of 2 teens in the latter stages of the movie.Initially it seemed that it was Ramya Krishnan's movie rather than Rajni's, but that was the highlight of the whole movie. You have to create something which is really bad so that our hero can destroy it with his flair.I am still angry at the ratings for this movie. Hats off to Ravikumar(director) and Rajni and Ramya.",best rajini,i was utterly disappointed after looking at rating movie 5 who are those who rated this movie i would give it straight 10 this was better movie compared chandramukhi course baba here director has given rajini ample scope perform all three stages heros life his style stunts comedy first half his responsible side after his dads demise as father 2 teens latter stages movie initially it seemed that it was ramya krishnans movie rather than rajnis but that was highlight whole movie you have create something which is really bad so that our hero can destroy it with his flair i am still angry at ratings this movie hats off ravikumar director rajni ramya,0.38974358974358975,0.002564102564102555,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.45}"

7.0,"Commercial ""Masala"" Movie","Entertaining to the core, this is another in a line of commercial Rajinikanth movies. Rajini is certainly the typical hero who can do no wrong! The usual Rajini magic with his one-liner (roughly translated as: My way is unique), stunts and songs about how grateful he is to Tamil Nadu and the people who have given him his fame are all there in this movie. Soundarya is rather aptly cast as the sweet servant who captures Rajini's heart. The real highlight is Ramya Krishnan as the villain. She plays the role of an egotistical and haughty woman who falls in love with the hero and has to deal with his rejection and ultimate marriage to her servant and yet remains undefeated!

7.0,A movie Rajni fans will love,The movie is designed to please Rajni lovers. It is action packed and full of Rajni mannerisms and AR Rehman songs.

10.0,The Best Mass Movie of All Time,"My friends this is one of the best movies in Tamil Cinema especially the best style of Rajnikanth sir. This is a celebration of the time when he first became superstar and a trend setter. I don't know what is up with the reviewers of this movie. Sure this movie is set in the village but this is the best movie that is based in the village as nowadays village movies are not that great anymore. The story is nice and the plot was good. Sure there were some illogical parts but come on its a superstar movie. Ramya Krishnan just stole the show I mean her performance was amazing and she was the one of the highlights of this film. Soundarya was good as well especially her shyness and innocence. Nassar is good and Manivannan was quite funny. Senthil as usual his comedy is good and keeps the movie going. Abbas had an amazing presence as Padyappa's son in law and one of the best actors of the '90s and '00s. The whole supporting cast performed well as they really helped the main cast. Of course I couldn't forget about the one and only Sivaji Ganesan who had a memorable presence in this film especially as the father of Padayappa. It was a rare occasion to see even more than one superstar in one movie. To see Sivaji Ganesan as superstar of one generation and Rajnikanth the superstar of the next generation. A.R. Rahman gave the best songs and BGM for Superstar Rajnikanth's movie. This is among his best works and among the best music for Rajni sir among Ilayaraja, MS Viswanathan, and Deva. Sivaji Ganesan even to this day is one of the best actors of all time. May his soul rest in peace. Soundarya was one of the most sought after actresses during the '90s and '00s may her soul rest in peace. Manivannan may his soul rest in peace. Padyappa is among one of Rajnikanth's best movies. This is style done gracefully and not only a treat for Rajnikanth fans but a treat for Indian movie fans. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",best mass movie all time,my friends this is one best movies tamil cinema especially best style rajnikanth sir this is celebration time when he first became superstar trend setter i dont know what is up with reviewers this movie sure this movie is set village but this is best movie that is based village as nowadays village movies are not that great anymore story is nice plot was good sure there were some illogical parts but come its superstar movie ramya krishnan just stole show i mean her performance was amazing she was one highlights this film soundarya was good as well especially her shyness innocence nassar is good manivannan was quite funny senthil as usual his comedy is good keeps movie going abbas had amazing presence as padyappas son law one best actors 90s 00s whole supporting cast performed well as they really helped main cast course i couldnt forget about one only sivaji ganesan who had memorable presence this film especially as father padayappa it was rare occasion see even more than one superstar one movie see sivaji ganesan as superstar one generation rajnikanth superstar next generation r rahman gave best songs bgm superstar rajnikanths movie this is among his best works among best music rajni sir among ilayaraja ms viswanathan deva sivaji ganesan even this day is one best actors all time may his soul rest peace soundarya was one most sought after actresses during 90s 00s may her soul rest peace manivannan may his soul rest peace padyappa is among one rajnikanths best movies this is style done gracefully not only treat rajnikanth fans but treat indian movie fans i would definitely recommend this friend,0.5758406432748538,0.4987938596491227,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.48, 'Sad': 0.02, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,Rajnikanth's best forever!!,Being a 90s kid while this movie was released it was like a festival. Even now if you watch the film is fresh. One could not ask for more from Rajnikanth. Such a splendid style that goes hand in hand with his dialogues and ARR music. So much of plot in the movie. A very well written family drama with lot of Goosebumps moments. One can go and watch it and feel energetic.,rajnikanths best forever,being 90s kid while this movie was released it was like festival even now if you watch film is fresh one could not ask more rajnikanth such splendid style that goes hand hand with his dialogues arr music so much plot movie very well written family drama with lot goosebumps moments one can go watch it feel energetic,0.475,0.4416666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.2}"
7.0,80s Family Drama formula blended into superhit mass action saga with Rajinikanth's larger than life image.,"Padayappa (1999) : Brief Review -80s Family Drama formula blended into superhit mass action saga with Rajinikanth's larger than life image. Everything about Padayappa is overwhelming and outbreaking for mass lovers. We have been through family dramas about pride and promises but none of them had such a terrific mass appeal. Tamil flick Nattamai was a trendsetter in that family drama genre with king sized characteristics and Padayappa is very much like copy of it except for the fact it gives you Rajinikanth in larger than life avatar. Remember Bahubali recently and how Rajamouli took his protagonist to almost god level with his extraordinary vision? If i can say so then Padayppa had the same vision then, of course considering the limits of filmmaking during 90s. The death of Padaiyappa's father destroys his family. But his luck changes, and he is able to lead a prosperous life, until his nemesis plots to ruin his happiness once more. That later half is quite similar 80s formula where we see the incomplete of Revenge of one generation is carried forward to the next generation in their old days. All said so, the writing doesn't really matter much because it's a out an out mass film so it just had to take care of basic storyline. Rajinikanth goes all out, full of his swag and on majestic level as Padayappa. He's unbeatable, he's the KING! Rajini was expected to do these marvelous things but Ramya Krishnan came as a Big Surprise! What a great female antagonist she had played. First she looks damn hot in the beginning, the sex appeal is too high. Later, she turns obsessive and reckless yet delivers a cracking performance. Rajini vs Ramya was like a Clash of Titans! Ravikumar goes completely out of the Box from narrow minded mass filmmaking and presents a larger than life mass Flick in Family Drama genre which was a rare thing, it still is actually. Overall, a Super Mass Entertainer for contemporary cinema.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",80s family drama formula blended into superhit mass action saga with rajinikanths larger than life image,padayappa 1999 brief review 80s family drama formula blended into superhit mass action saga with rajinikanths larger than life image everything about padayappa is overwhelming outbreaking mass lovers we have been through family dramas about pride promises but none them had such terrific mass appeal tamil flick nattamai was trendsetter that family drama genre with king sized characteristics padayappa is very much like copy it except fact it gives you rajinikanth larger than life avatar remember bahubali recently how rajamouli took his protagonist almost god level with his extraordinary vision if i can say so then padayppa had same vision then course considering limits filmmaking during 90s death padaiyappas father destroys his family but his luck changes he is able lead prosperous life until his nemesis plots ruin his happiness once more that later half is quite similar 80s formula where we see incomplete revenge one generation is carried forward next generation their old days all said so writing doesnt really matter much because its out out mass film so it just had take care basic storyline rajinikanth goes all out full his swag majestic level as padayappa hes unbeatable hes king rajini was expected do these marvelous things but ramya krishnan came as big surprise what great female antagonist she had played first she looks damn hot beginning sex appeal is too high later she turns obsessive reckless yet delivers cracking performance rajini vs ramya was like clash titans ravikumar goes completely out box narrow minded mass filmmaking presents larger than life mass flick family drama genre which was rare thing it still is actually overall super mass entertainer contemporary cinema rating 7 10 by,0.40264227642276423,0.1643089430894309,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.29}"
