,A three hour film that feels too short,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me.

10.0,Awesome,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people.""",awesome,movie started out pretty innocently first 20 minutes i was wondering where movie was going then it started happen horrible cruelty concentration camps oskar schindler is example man that no matter what situation there are people who wont go along with cruelty society im sure it took courage do what he did because one wrong move youll be dead movie brought life this great man who really shouldnt be forgotten thanks steven spielberg i think hell be remembered generations come movie like this should be made once while not that movie should be used evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well movie is still best vehicle do so i still think that oskar shindlers last words this movie was one best dialog movie history why did i keep this badge i could have saved person why did i keep this car i could have saved five more people,0.5599206349206349,0.2857142857142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,"Bring me the heads of Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann n Mengele.","Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry.

10.0,You don't have to be Jewish to be touched by this response to inhumanity.,"History has proved that the old saying, ""God makes mad first whom he intends to destroy"", and in the case of Nazi Ralph Fiennes in this Steven Spielberg masterpiece, that is oh, so true. Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight ""Die, Nazi, Die!"" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and ""Schindler's List"" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like ""Schindler's List"" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life ""Schindler Jews"" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.",you dont have be jewish be touched by this response inhumanity,history has proved that old saying god makes mad first whom he intends destroy case nazi ralph fiennes this steven spielberg masterpiece that is oh so true unfortunately lot innocent people have pay that madness meanwhile that truly adds intensity his madness as it increases his vileness just gets more more out control other end spectrum is liam neesons oscar schindler businessman who knows by allowing nazis take his jewish workers away his productivity will suffer selfish motives keep these innocent people being sent death camps as schindler learns truth about atrocities going becomes closer people who work very hard him he goes out his way keep nazis going through with their evil plans atrocities you see here are things we cant fathom here america innocent children are forced hide human waste avoid discovery innocent woman prisoner with background architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that building being constructed is doomed collapse after which evil fiennes simply orders his men do what she suggested fiennes picks targets guns them down also has schindlers aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old contribute innocent young girl red coat only color this black white movie wanders around warsaw as ghetto is destroyed neeson almost looses his right hand man magnificent ben kingsley because paperwork mix up this culminates most daring escapes nazi persecution that is where neeson realizes full effect whats going breaking down scene that will have you shivering your seat i cant watch these movies without temptation scream at nazis screen even most outlandish propaganda films war era i tended either applaud loudly or scream delight die nazi die as villain gets their come uppance either through brutal murder or firing squad after lengthy trial revealed their shame many those times my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged me that i was unaware i was capable you cant call these feelings manipulation by direction spielberg obviously felt passion story he was telling as if he knows that this can cross over into any race any culture any religion rarely recent movie history has it been so obvious when film was released that it would sweep academy awards schindlers list truly deserved every honor which it received some stories are so painful that you cant go back watch them easily i find that every so often i need movie like schindlers list remind me how vile humanity can be how one compassionate human being can change course history so many finale with real life schindler jews honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy,0.4938062169312169,0.012106481481481485,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Spielberg's most important work,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done.

10.0,"Incredibly moving and visually disturbing, Spielburg's best by far!","Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10.

10.0,It's About Our Humanity,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.",its about our humanity,we need look at work art like this see ourselves this movie this is result regime that no longer saw worth human being it politicize life this leads monstrous treatment people because they are not people their eyes i saw this film first week it came out we were vacation hilton head island south carolina i remember my wife i not being able talk almost 15 minutes after it was over then we needed talk about something else there are few experiences that can do that someone since that time ive had many others tell me same thing why is this movie so much more effective than other holocaust films first all theres something personal about it we get know people even bad guys secondly recreation death camps is so accurate then there is spot genius little girl red coat if anyone wants complain about black white watch this film we get see what can be done with shades shadows work schindler is work heart against great odds scene at end when holocaust survivors visit graveyard is what moves film i think that everyone should see this film at some time then sit down think about what is being done people here our own country,0.37234299516908215,0.146316425120773,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,Devastating,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget.",devastating,holocaust is dark touchy subject many many believed it never happened despite meticulous records kept by nazis themselves those who lived through it were scarred forever even now can barely bring themselves discuss its horrors despite controversy around event there is one thing certain steven spielberg created masterpiece with schindlers list it is film that will find no equal terms bleak crushing drama it sets out what it intends do marvelously leaves viewer emotionally drained questioning humanity itself film is black white very conscious choice by director that makes subject matter already disturbing even more so bleak harrowing oskar schindler is known saving thousands jews destined grim fate during world war 2 movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal with constant brutal oppression by nazi camp guards sadistic amon goth with terrifying portrayal by ralph fiennes yes this film will not make you cheery or happy yes it is about miserable dark period human history but it is important film watch anyone interested this historic subject matter also beautiful work art film lovers truly one spielbergs finest works fact that he is jewish himself does add personal touch tragic tale but he never tries overdo sympathy or antipathy towards any group film everyone is human this film jews nazis tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period history we will never forget,0.5834523809523811,-0.0636845238095238,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.3}"

,Emotional Release,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List. At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change. I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial. I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure. After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film. It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself. I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing. I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things. Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a pile of personal photographs of family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses. That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock. I was kind of mad at Spielberg. I mean, doesn't he know when to back off. It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever.",emotional release,i dont know why but couple days ago i pulled out my copy schindlers list at first i thought well maybe ill watch few minutes it its so depressing but i feel like watching good movie change i hadnt seen this picture several years since it was released first time i saw film theater i went with my parents was somewhat denial i tried block out pain that was before me retain my composure after realizing its brilliance i tried forget film it certainly wasnt something dwell this time when i watched film i really surprised myself i sat cried like i havent years but thats good thing ive been so divorced my feelings so wrapped up my own selfish hell that i forgot what life is capable becoming now spielberg himself has admitted that he tends over sentimentalize things take scene when stern has just been rescued train by schindler as two men walk away camera pans large room where suitcases countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through pile personal photographs family lay strewn amidst wasted boots eye glasses that scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened i will admit that towards end when schindler was going about how he could have sold his car save more lives or sold his pin even second inspection that scene seems rather forced even enough jerry seinfeld mock i was kind mad at spielberg i mean doesnt he know when back off it seems with absolute masterpiece like this film he would have been more careful edited out this truly sentimental passage with violins going haywire regardless im awe this picture with his latest saving private ryan i do think that spielberg is truly one if not greatest directors film ever,0.557127192982456,0.0526159147869674,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,When The State Dehumanizes A People,"It would not have been possible to have made Schindler's List immediately after World War II. The public was just taking in the magnitude of the Holocaust, they might not have believed it. Fortunately for the prosecutors at Nuremberg and for history the Nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. With a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of Israel questioned by those who ought to know better, Steven Spielberg has given us a work for the ages.If you can sit through two incredibly long and sorrowful films one ought to see Schindler's List back to back with The Diary Of Anne Frank. In the latter film, we see a very ordinary group of people fighting for survival to escape the fate of what we see happened to so many. The fact they were days from possible liberation makes the sorrow of that film all the more poignant.Schindler's List is a story of escape from the ultimate fate of six million. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson is a German businessman who sees a chance at some nice war profits using some incredibly cheap labor from the concentration camps. He's willing to start a factory in occupied Poland with slave labor Jews. Towards that end he hears of a man who ran a factory among the Jews in the newly formed Cracow ghetto, Itzak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Kingsley agrees to work for him and with him recruiting the labor force, Neeson gets his factory going. With that comes responsibility for these people. He fights for them, the original ones and some added to his growing work force. Over the over 3 hour film, Neeson gradually changes and his concern for his charges becomes humanitarian. He plays a dangerous game, especially with concentration camp commandant Ralph Fiennes. A man who delights in the total power he's been handed and the liberation from all civilized restraints to exercise barbarism, arbitrary and capricious. Fiennes will chill you with his penultimate portrayal of a perfect Nazi.Let us not forget that Schindler himself was a Nazi. He did in fact in the end go broke in paying out bribes for special consideration for his charges that meant their very lives. It's also possible that he saw the way the war would end and that those responsible for the Holocaust would be held accountable. Some have speculated that he did this for no other reason than to bank credit with possible witnesses. If that was the case it certainly worked because he was investigated and not charged with any war crimes.Still I'd prefer to believe the testimony of those on the scene including the real life Itzak Stern. Those are the folks that ought to know.Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg.

10.0,"""This list... is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf.""","The Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed.Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, ""Batman Begins"") was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the Kraków Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache.""It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave.With the arrival of Amon Goeth (played as the epitome of evil by Ralph Fiennes, ""Red Dragon""), a Hauptsturmführer of the SS, the hopeless plight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""Today is history,"" proclaims Goeth. ""Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of it. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history.""This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible.Long known as a ""blockbuster"" filmmaker  with such adventure classics as ""Jaws,"" ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to his name - ""Schindler's List"" was - and remains - Steven Spielberg's most mature directorial effort. Working with a screenplay that Steven Zaillian adapted from Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning 'Schindler's Ark,' Spielberg treats the subject matter with the respect it deserves. Wisely choosing to depict the events as realistically as possible, Spielberg allows the images to speak for themselves. Flawless acting, stunning cinematography and a haunting John Williams score excel this film above all others of the 1990s. This is the powerful story of the difference that just one man can make, and it is a story that deserves to be seen by all. We can only feel grateful that it was Steven Spielberg who chose to be at the helm.",this list is absolute good list is life all around its margins lies gulf,holocaust is undoubtedly one most significant horrifying events twentieth century between 1938 1945 jewish population was segregated persecuted culminating merciless slaughter approximately six million jews this figure is quoted film though most historical estimates vary between five seven million amidst all this butchery one man decided make difference famously saving lives more than 1100 jews men women children who would otherwise have been killed oskar schindler played brilliantly by liam neeson batman begins was sudeten german industrialist wealthy womanizer who wasnt afraid throw his money around always bearing his nazi party badge proudly schindler would often frequent nightclubs extravagantly showering high ranked nazi officers their girlfriends with champagne caviar with impeccable connections black market there was little that he couldnt get his hands he was good person know buying friends was something that schindler could do well he would often use these newfound alliances aid his own business ventures when thousands polish jew population was relegated krak w ghetto 1941 schindler saw opportunity further success enlisting desperate jewish investors employing jewish workers who were substantially cheaper employ open enamelware factory his connections high places ensured lucrative army contracts schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew despite doing little run company beyond offering it certain panache it is clear beginning that oskar schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices when schindler requests services itzhak stern superb ben kingsley gandhi clever humanitarian jewish accountant stern declares that by law i have tell you sir im jew well im german so there we are replies schindler indifferently before getting straight business it is not race that he is concerned with it is himself course his money stern does not enjoy running schindlers business he initially acquires little satisfaction it when schindler attempts convey his genuine gratitude his profitable services with glass whiskey stern absentmindedly refuses drink it embittered schindler drinks it himself before ordering stern leave with arrival amon goeth played as epitome evil by ralph fiennes red dragon hauptsturmf hrer ss hopeless plight jews grows darker harrowing extended sequence largely based testimonies holocaust survivors jews are mercilessly liquidated krakow ghetto many simply shot spot today is history proclaims goeth today will be remembered years now young will ask with wonder about this day today is history you are part it six centuries there has been jewish krakow by this evening those six centuries will be rumor they never happened today is history this sequence also marks celebrated appearance little girl red coat ingenious plot device character was based upon real girl named roma ligocka who unlike her film counterpart survived war wrote memoir entitled girl red coat memoir embodiment innocence schindler spots small girl wandering amongst black white chaos krakow ghetto we follow her as she retreats into building takes shelter under bed when schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him be incinerated he is understandably horrified unable understand how soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent this event memorably signifies turning point schindlers attitudes towards carnage fuelling his desire save as many jews as possible long known as blockbuster filmmaker with such adventure classics as jaws e t extra terrestrial raiders lost ark his name schindlers list was remains steven spielbergs most mature directorial effort working with screenplay that steven zaillian adapted thomas keneallys booker prize winning schindlers ark spielberg treats subject matter with respect it deserves wisely choosing depict events as realistically as possible spielberg allows images speak themselves flawless acting stunning cinematography haunting john williams score excel this film above all others 1990s this is powerful story difference that just one man can make it is story that deserves be seen by all we can only feel grateful that it was steven spielberg who chose be at helm,0.5095265462506843,0.1090831964969896,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.46}"

Equally good is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then helps Schindler save more people.

9.0,"Harrowing, Disturbing & Beautifully Filmed","This isn't much I can add to what hasn't been said or written some dozen years after this was released. It's still one of the most powerful stories ever put on film, mainly because it's based on fact. Since it's Hollywood, you don't know how much of this is true but the Holocaust certainly is and that's enough. The little details don't matter.This movie features extremely good acting by the three leads: Liam Neson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley. Fiennes is particularly good as the Nazi villain. He's downright scary and one of the most rotten, despicable human beings ever put on film....but that was the intent. I don't know if his character (or lack of it) was exaggerated since this was made by a famous Jewish filmmaker (Steven Spielberg) who has made the Nazis look as bad as possible in a number of his movie (not that they don't deserve it!). Nonetheless, Fiennes' portrayal of ""Amon Goeth"" is one you'll remember. You'll want to punch this idiot right in the nose.Neeson, in the title role as ""Oskar Schlinder,"" is intriguing as the industrialist who slowly sees immoral things happening that the become too repulsive for him to support. For much of the film, he still isn't a ""good guy"" but he certainly comes around and becomes a hero in the end. Neeson's scene near the conclusion when ""Schindler"" parts with ""his"" Jews at the end of the war is extremely moving. It brings tears to my eyes every time. When he agonizes that ""I could have done more,"" it is something all of us could say and probably will some day. That sentence by him haunted me after each viewing.In addition to the moving story, the black-and-white cinematography in here is magnificent. Not many movies today are made in black-and-white and that's too bad because with today's cameras and knowledge, it can look tremendous. (i.e. ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" ""Ed Wood,"" etc.) The camera-work helped draw me back to several viewings.A lot of people would not watch this movie a second time and I can't blame them. It's tough to watch. There are some brutal, harrowing, scenes in here with executions, naked people being led to the gas chambers....just some very disturbing scenes. It should be seen at least once, though, by everyone.",harrowing disturbing beautifully filmed,this isnt much i can add what hasnt been said or written some dozen years after this was released its still one most powerful stories ever put film mainly because its based fact since its hollywood you dont know how much this is true but holocaust certainly is thats enough little details dont matter this movie features extremely good acting by three leads liam neson ralph fiennes ben kingsley fiennes is particularly good as nazi villain hes downright scary one most rotten despicable human beings ever put film but that was intent i dont know if his character or lack it was exaggerated since this was made by famous jewish filmmaker steven spielberg who has made nazis look as bad as possible number his movie not that they dont deserve it nonetheless fiennes portrayal amon goeth is one youll remember youll want punch this idiot right nose neeson title role as oskar schlinder is intriguing as industrialist who slowly sees immoral things happening that become too repulsive him support much film he still isnt good guy but he certainly comes around becomes hero end neesons scene near conclusion when schindler parts with his jews at end war is extremely moving it brings tears my eyes every time when he agonizes that i could have done more it is something all us could say probably will some day that sentence by him haunted me after each viewing addition moving story black white cinematography here is magnificent not many movies today are made black white thats too bad because with todays cameras knowledge it can look tremendous i e man who wasnt there ed wood etc camera work helped draw me back several viewings lot people would not watch this movie second time i cant blame them its tough watch there are some brutal harrowing scenes here with executions naked people being led gas chambers just some very disturbing scenes it should be seen at least once though by everyone,0.5374007936507935,0.035511739417989456,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,My brief review of the film,"The most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an epic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age.",my brief review film,most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made be epic or acclaimed film spielberg made it as personal film himself other jews affected by holocaust there is nothing flashy about film except neesons bravura performance spielbergs usual style is invisible cinematography editing although excellent are not shown off make spectacle film or give it epic feel yet it is still compulsive involving utterly heart wrenchingly moving filming part history that should not be forgotten screenplay is one best ever written it captures stories so many holocaust survivors but without distracting main story at hand black white photography editing is perfect john williams provides perfectly subtle but nice music score acting is simply brilliant with liam neeson towering as oskar schindler ralph fiennes bringing out nazi character amon goeth into full flesh ben kingsley embeth davidtz give off excellent performances too film also has lot say about absolute power corrupting spiraling out control such message film can be applied any time crisis not just holocaust this is not just one ten best films ever produced but it shall remain so years come because its messages terms power racism are applicable any age,0.5287037037037038,0.2830246913580247,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Powerful and moving if not exactly a fun night in!,"As Nazi Germany invades Poland, opportunist Oscar Schindler sees a chance to open a factory serving the military and using Jews for labour. However, as the full horror of the war on the Jewish people becomes ever more clear, Schindler's selfishness turns more into compassion for his fellowman.Having spent 10 weeks watching `Taken' and remembering just how awful Spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental, I revisited this film as it was showing in the build up to the TV coverage of the 2003 Oscar ceremony. It is a powerful film simply because Spielberg manages to keep the mush out of it and just let the events speak for themselves. When people are shot on the street there is no John Williams music or slow-motion, they simply fall in a bloody heap and the film moves on. This makes it shockingly cold and that is the aim.The story is difficult to summarise because a surprising amount of it is spent away from the story of Schindler and on the plight of the Jews generally. Again this theme within the narrative stops to wandering and allows it to be impacting. True there is an element of `look what happened, isn't this terrible?' about it, but not too much. In the final hour in particular it gets a little sentimental but not to the point of spoiling things.Neeson's Schindler makes you wonder why he wasn't able to get any character into his recent role in Star Wars I. Here he keeps Schindler a complex man, driven by a mix of selfishness and compassion but Spielberg simplifies him a bit towards the end (but I may be being a bit picky). Fiennes' Goeth is also wonderfully drawn. A cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities and Fiennes holds the focus whenever he is onscreen. The support cast are all excellent right down to extras  if you think it is easy to scream and wail convincingly then you should compare this to Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones! I never doubted that any of the actors were anything but the characters they played.Spielberg rightly won his Oscars for this and his direction is excellent. Although I do dislike him immensely when he goes all `apple pie' on us, he is great at what he does and this is one of his best films since Jaws. A powerful, moving film that is moving for all the right reasons and not just because John Williams cranks in. Difficult to watch but worth the effort.",powerful moving if not exactly fun night,as nazi germany invades poland opportunist oscar schindler sees chance open factory serving military using jews labour however as full horror war jewish people becomes ever more clear schindlers selfishness turns more into compassion his fellowman having spent 10 weeks watching taken remembering just how awful spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental i revisited this film as it was showing build up tv coverage 2003 oscar ceremony it is powerful film simply because spielberg manages keep mush out it just let events speak themselves when people are shot street there is no john williams music or slow motion they simply fall bloody heap film moves this makes it shockingly cold that is aim story is difficult summarise because surprising amount it is spent away story schindler plight jews generally again this theme within narrative stops wandering allows it be impacting true there is element look what happened isnt this terrible about it but not too much final hour particular it gets little sentimental but not point spoiling things neesons schindler makes you wonder why he wasnt able get any character into his recent role star wars i here he keeps schindler complex man driven by mix selfishness compassion but spielberg simplifies him bit towards end but i may be being bit picky fiennes goeth is also wonderfully drawn cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities fiennes holds focus whenever he is onscreen support cast are all excellent right down extras if you think it is easy scream wail convincingly then you should compare this kate capshaw indiana jones i never doubted that any actors were anything but characters they played spielberg rightly won his oscars this his direction is excellent although i do dislike him immensely when he goes all apple pie us he is great at what he does this is one his best films since jaws powerful moving film that is moving all right reasons not just because john williams cranks difficult watch but worth effort,0.6371941137566137,0.0982101521164021,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.44}"

8.0,A moving story.,"Steven Spielberg, until the appearance of this film, was rightly noted mainly for his child's view of movies, fast action, easy sentiment, and a generally accurate sense of appeal to fantasy and wish fulfillment. He pretty much discarded that sort of innocence here, without leaving behind his appreciation of the commercial value of a story.It's impossible not to be deeply moved. The extermination program of the Nazis was the most horrific offense to human morality of the 20th century, and one of the worst in history. It wasn't the worst of the slaughters. The two world wars qualified for those honors. It wasn't even the worst example of ethnic cleansing, as it's come to be called. But more than six million Jews and more than seven million other undesirables -- homosexuals, the mentally ill, gypsies, political dissidents -- perished in the camps and not a single Jewish family in Europe went untouched. And it wasn't a war in which the victims were fighting back. It was a deliberate and very thorough act of genocide on the part of a people that Madame de Stael once described as ""a nation of poets and dreamers.""It's a kind of ""cross-over"" movie in which the protagonist is not Jewish but rather a Christian who comes to their rescue. A basically decent man comes to his senses. This is the formula, whether the despised and abused minority are Jews or African-Americans. If it were otherwise, there would be a danger of this being seen somehow as a ""Jewish"" movie by the unenlightened masses and, as a consequence, might suffer at the box office. Better ""In the Heat of the Night"" than ""Superfly."" But Spielberg has avoided most of the clichés associated with films of the final solution. No voice overs telling us of the suffering. No stock footage of bull dozers plowing corpses into mass graves. For the most part, the story stays at the personal level. (We hear hardly anything of the progress of the war.) And it's at this level that the film excels, due to the mature script and the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Feinnes. There are many other characters, including Embeth Davidtz.The film is good because Neason's character begins not as a racist or a humanitarian but as a moral nihilist. He cares about nothing but money and the sensory pleasures it affords. He couldn't care less about the Jews, or about the Nazis either for that matter. The war to him is just a way of making a profit using cheap labor. And the script rises above the formulaic in not giving him a moment of epiphany. At no point does his brow furrow, his eyes light up, and he thinks to himself, ""My God, what am I doing?"" Nope. Instead, his development is informed by minor but important insights distributed here and there. After the surrender, he leaves the camp as a fugitive, dressed in prison clothes, mourning his carelessness in not saving more lives.Spielberg tells the story in a straightforward way but of course some incidents and dialog from events of fifty years ago must be fabricated. And the fabrications are well done. Especially enjoyable is the touchy, sometimes abrasive, and often humorous relationship between Neason, the salesman and con man who simply has no head for business, and Ben Kingsley as the matter-of-fact accountant who does. I'd give examples of some exchanges but there isn't space.Spielberg hasn't quite gotten over his taste for easy sentimentality. There are only two touches of color in this black-and-white movie. A little girl in a rose-colored coat appears two or three times, so that we can know who it is when her body is wheeled past in a barrow, just another victim. And when the workers hold a ceremony on Shabat, the candle flames are touched with a warm orange that signifies life. Effective, yes, but unnecessary in an adult film like this. Most people watching the film may be trusted to know what's going on without being nudged. But that's small stuff. Somewhat more embarrassing is a scene in which a German officer screams like a maniac and makes gargoyle faces at the camera after emptying his pistol into a mountain of burning bodies. Are we supposed to learn from this that the people running the camps were evil? The Nazi's extermination program prompted many studies in social science, none of which has contributed much to our understanding of why this, and similar programs, seem to be so common around the world. It's easy enough to blame Germany and the SS, but what happened in Kosovo, Maylasia, Cambodia, and Rwanda? Perhaps one of the reasons we've never really understood it is that we don't want to. Perhaps the answer lies not in ""F"" (for ""facism"") scales or ideographic studies of power but in the darkest aspects of human nature itself. Is there a group of people who have nothing in common but their ethnic identity that we ourselves would enjoy seeing wiped off the map? We all have massive cerebral cortices, much of the functions of which seem devoted to damping down impulses from structures lower down on the brain that generate desires to mate, to flee from danger, and to kill things and people that get in our way. Some day science might give us an answer but until then we have to rely on poets like Robert Burns.'Many and sharp the num'rous ills Inwoven with our frame! More pointed still we make ourselves Regret, remorse, and shame!
