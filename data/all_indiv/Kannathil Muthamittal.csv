9.0,Deeply touching...,"I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.This is the first Indian film I've seen in the Tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one. Amudha is played by P.S. Keerthana, and she is one of the few child actors I've seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying. Her charm and beauty held the film together.",deeply touching,i saw this film at 2002 toronto international film festival this is first indian film ive seen tamil language while it does share some similarities with other indian films wonderful music choreography sweeping storyline director attempts more than just entertain film tells story amudha precocious nine year old whose parents reveal her that she was adopted thus beginning odyssey that takes them all india war torn sri lanka gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes violence expressly make point though it is simplistic one amudha is played by p s keerthana she is one few child actors ive seen who can be precocious yet not annoying her charm beauty held film together,0.5256944444444445,0.14375000000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.15}"
9.0,Splendid,"Sri Lanka... not a country I've ever given much thought to, I have to admit. I didn't even know it was near India, let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983. It seems that the rebels of the Tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years, causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island.Mani Ratman's latest film, A PECK ON THE CHEEK, tells the story of a young girl named Amudha, who is separated from her Sri Lankan parents by the war and raised by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a bright and mischievous girl, whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. Although her adopted parents love her as much as could be, and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children, Amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family.Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it the other way around?). A PECK ON THE CHEEK inhabits similar territory, but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers. The central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family, and especially that between a child and her adopted parents. It's a pretty honest and open look at feelings, that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others. It's an emotionally complex film, with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way.The film revolves around 9 year old Amudha, played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress P.S. Keerthana in her first and only acting role. She's a princess and a monster, always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long. The young actress is perfectly cast for the role, and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her.A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name I was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience. Never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact, I dare say. The film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen.Mani Ratman's direction is superb, very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work I've seen from this director yet. The film is visually very stylish, with some excellent camerawork and imagery. A.R. Rahman provides the film's soundtrack, which is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music (based on first impressions at least) but still shows his great musical talent.I'm not aware of a DVD release for the film yet - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. The production is a truly world class effort, and I am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure.Recommended.",splendid,sri lanka not country ive ever given much thought i have admit i didnt even know it was near india let alone that there has been bloody civil war going there since 1983 it seems that rebels tamil minority have been ongoing conflict with military regime that runs country many years causing many deaths widespread suffering island mani ratmans latest film peck cheek tells story young girl named amudha who is separated her sri lankan parents by war raised by young indian couple amudha is bright mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as child although her adopted parents love her as much as could be have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children amudha cannot help but want learn more about her biological family mani ratman is probably best known his 1998 film dil se which hides story about terrorism politics inside love story or is it other way around peck cheek inhabits similar territory but is perhaps more ambitious ground it covers central theme that binds movie is love between all various members family especially that between child her adopted parents its pretty honest open look at feelings that can be extremely touching heartwarming at some times quite painful at others its emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave very human way film revolves around 9 year old amudha played with charm vivaciousness by young actress p s keerthana her first only acting role shes princess monster always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her long young actress is perfectly cast role does tremendous job various often difficult emotional scenes required her peck cheek has such innocent name i was quite unprepared intensity experience never has such small act come with such enormous emotional impact i dare say film is bold artistic effort explore issues that are not frequently covered silver screen mani ratmans direction is superb very confident mature most sophisticated work ive seen this director yet film is visually very stylish with some excellent camerawork imagery r rahman provides films soundtrack which is not as good as his classic dil se or bombay music based first impressions at least but still shows his great musical talent im not aware dvd release film yet i saw it tamil with english subtitles thanks san francisco international film festival which film was undoubtedly highlight production is truly world class effort i am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins receive wider exposure recommended,0.5530230880230879,0.20674603174603173,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,The Unconditional Love Of Two Parents,"Mani Ratnam's 'Kannathil Muthamittal' is another of the movie from his 'political terror' series (along with films like 'Roja', 'Bombay' and 'Dil se'). It tells an intense story about 9 year old Amudha who, with the help of her adopted parents, seeks to find her birth mother in Sri Lanka. The movie is set with the backdrop of the civil war in Sri Lanka. With the help of the actors, Ratnam terrifically demonstrates the depth of the relationships between the adopt parents and the child. Their unconditional love for Amudha brings them all the way to war-driven and terror stricken villages in search for Amudha's answers. In a beautiful scene, even after being attacked and escaping a fatal encounter, Indra, for her daughter's satisfaction, bravely suggests without hesitation that they go to the park to check if Shama has arrived.The cinematography is wonderful and the sets and the exotic locations are mindblowing. In addition to that there is A.R. Rahman's soulful score. I loved the songs, the title song being my favourite. The soundtrack reminds us Rahman's older music. I did not like how the last song was visualized on the father and daughter. It uses the clich√©d meditation scenes, the Buddha statue (ridiculously positioned at different angles) and the typical monks-walking-at-the back. While many of the songs are beautiful, they look a little out of place. A question, why was Amudha so obsessed with finding her biological mother while she asks no questions regarding her biological father.'Kannathil Muthamittal' boasts of some very strong performances. Simran delivers a beautifully understated performance who loves her daughter no matter what. Madhavan is sublime. His intensity and restraint prove what a skillful actor he is. Young actress P.S. Keerthana holds her own with these professional actors. The film centres around her and she does a fine job by pulling it off. Nandita Das is fabulous. Prakash Raj is irritating and his Sinhalese is all wrong.Though 'Kannathil Muthamittal' revolves mainly around the Tamil people, the film is, in a way, arguably a bit partial as it shows how the war has affected the Tamil people in Sri Lanka without implying how this also had severely dangerous consequences for the non-Tamil Sri Lankan. Then again, the war is only a part of the film as 'Kannathil Muthamittal' is more about the unconditional love between two parents and their daughter. This is another outstanding movie by Mani Ratnam before he went downhill with movies like 'Yuva' and 'Guru'.",unconditional love two parents,mani ratnams kannathil muthamittal is another movie his political terror series along with films like roja bombay dil se it tells intense story about 9 year old amudha who with help her adopted parents seeks find her birth mother sri lanka movie is set with backdrop civil war sri lanka with help actors ratnam terrifically demonstrates depth relationships between adopt parents child their unconditional love amudha brings them all way war driven terror stricken villages search amudhas answers beautiful scene even after being attacked escaping fatal encounter indra her daughters satisfaction bravely suggests without hesitation that they go park check if shama has arrived cinematography is wonderful sets exotic locations are mindblowing addition that there is r rahmans soulful score i loved songs title song being my favourite soundtrack reminds us rahmans older music i did not like how last song was visualized father daughter it uses clich d meditation scenes buddha statue ridiculously positioned at different angles typical monks walking at back while many songs are beautiful they look little out place question why was amudha so obsessed with finding her biological mother while she asks no questions regarding her biological father kannathil muthamittal boasts some very strong performances simran delivers beautifully understated performance who loves her daughter no matter what madhavan is sublime his intensity restraint prove what skillful actor he is young actress p s keerthana holds her own with these professional actors film centres around her she does fine job by pulling it off nandita das is fabulous prakash raj is irritating his sinhalese is all wrong though kannathil muthamittal revolves mainly around tamil people film is way arguably bit partial as it shows how war has affected tamil people sri lanka without implying how this also had severely dangerous consequences non tamil sri lankan then again war is only part film as kannathil muthamittal is more about unconditional love between two parents their daughter this is another outstanding movie by mani ratnam before he went downhill with movies like yuva guru,0.6656018518518518,0.23821759259259256,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.48}"

I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.By the way to all we westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move. I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges toppled Lagaan last year.'Devdas' is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love, fate and destiny. I would keep away from it. Anyway, not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a revamp Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many issues. They are heavily talented but not showcased properly.",how did they miss this movie,i am big follower indian movies especially malayalam tamil shame india not sending this movie as their official oscar entry i have seen this movie it has clearly revealed me maturity tamil cinema has its screenplay narrative which bollywood better catch up with by way all we westerners tamil cinema is more qualitative very different bollywood which is all about good looks glamour promotion coming point what was india thinking when they sent movie like devdas oscars that was really masochist move i think they are trying punish oscar judges with boredom by sending devdas since judges toppled lagaan last year devdas is just brigthly colored but stale predictable melodrama love fate destiny i would keep away it anyway not sending movie like kanathil muthital shows how much revamp indian administration needs save them poor administrators who lack intelligence now i know why this country has so many issues they are heavily talented but not showcased properly,0.45722222222222214,0.1388888888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9.0,An entertaining film that also tackles serious issues,"In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. Human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek, winner of several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human cost of war is made quite clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.Beautifully photographed in Southern India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of Sri Lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by P.S. Keerthana in a memorable performance, Amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (J.D. Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a Red Cross camp. In a loving flashback, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, father Thiru (Madhavan) a prominent Tamil writer, and mother Indra (Simran) a TV personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.Young Amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. While she is playing, Thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that ""you are not our daughter"" and the response is predictable. Distraught, she questions who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the Tamil separatists. The family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mostly with skill by Ratnam, though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however, I found the musical dramatizations of songs by A. R. Rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich√©d and commercial, yet A Peck on the Cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. That it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.",entertaining film that also tackles serious issues,sri lanka country divided by religion language civil war between pro sinhalese government liberation tigers tamil eelam ltte separatist organization has claimed estimated 68 000 lives since 1983 human rights groups have said that as result war more than one million people have been displaced homeless or living camps impact children families caught conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam his 2002 film peck cheek winner several awards at national film awards india while civil war is merely backdrop story young girls voyage discovery human cost war is made quite clear ratnam gives fighting universal context pointing finger at global arms traffickers as source wrongdoing beautifully photographed southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran setting mirroring terrain sri lanka film tells moving story about adopted 9 year old girl who sets out find her real mother middle fighting sri lanka played with deep feeling expressiveness by p s keerthana memorable performance amudha is brought up by loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama nandita das dileepan j d chakravarthi were forced flee when fighting broke out leaving her red cross camp loving flashback we see amudhas adoptive parents father thiru madhavan prominent tamil writer mother indra simran tv personality marry facilitate their adoption darker skinned little girl young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly her ninth birthday according parents prior agreement while she is playing thiru tells her almost matter fact tone that you are not our daughter response is predictable distraught she questions who her father was what her mothers name was why she gave her up so forth but few answers are forthcoming amudha runs away several times until her parents agree go sri lanka help her find her true mother now fighter tamil separatists familys immersion reality civil war leads some traumatic moments difficult decisions handled mostly with skill by ratnam though sequence where family was caught crossfire felt amateurish peck cheek is course bollywood style film that means tons music melodrama melodrama did not get way because strong performances by lead actors however i found musical dramatizations songs by r rahman counter mood film with their slick high production techniques fast paced music video style editing yet compelling nature story honesty which it is told transcend films limitations tamil cinema has been criticized by many even within country as being too clich d commercial yet peck cheek is both film entertainment one that tackles serious issues that it successfully straddles line between art commerce is not rejection but tribute,0.43201923076923077,0.06758012820512821,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,The two faces of motherhood.,"I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha, a playful well-loved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence. On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. This tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her. Several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother. The country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess. But this also leads to their meeting the new Shyama - one who finally is confronted by Amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter.The story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons that drive the birth mother, the normalcy of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film. The film has excellent performances from Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolute stunner role as Amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste P. S. Keerthana. This performance won her a National award.The cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. I am intrigued by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. I think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl. His one liners were hilarious. The mother played by Simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids. The shock, angst, and obsession of the child Amudha was outstandingly portrayed by P. S. Keerthana. Her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking. In fact the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das, and her husband. Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. It also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy.Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - I rarely weep in the movies, but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick. This is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film!",two faces motherhood,i finally snagged copy kannathil muthamittal through netflix spent new yeras eve watching amazing drama unfold it began with shyama winsome nandita das getting married dhileepan backwaters sri lanka then war takes over their romance shyama has flee india is refugee camp as she gives birth child several years later we see amudha playful well loved child p s keerthana who is darling or burden teachers parents fellow schoolmates alike very how solve problem like maria sequence her birthday she is told by her parents thiru madhavan indra simran that she is not their biological child she was adopted this tilts her confident love filled world she constantly dwells why her birth mother left her several attempts at truancy later adoptive parents take her sri lanka try find her birth mother country is torn asunder by raging civil war trio are inevitably caught up mess but this also leads their meeting new shyama one who finally is confronted by amudha asked why she abandoned her daughter story child who has grapple with fact that she was abandoned at birth her obsessive drive reconnect with her birth mother unconditional love adoptive parents demons that drive birth mother normalcy chennai horrors terrorism ravaged sri lanka mani ratnam made masterful film that blended many ingredients into saga that is soul stirring ar rahmans music beautifully complements magical poignant moments film film has excellent performances madhavan nandita das simran absolute stunner role as amudha abandoned one done by child artiste p s keerthana this performance won her national award cinematography is visual poetry each frame is beautifully crafted breathtakingly shot i am intrigued by connection mani ratnam has with terrorism love obsessions i think his exploration these subjects is absolutely outstanding mahadevans character was quite unique his passion idealism did not make him selfish rather was well matched with how much he cared little girl his one liners were hilarious mother played by simran was also quite multi dimensional she was idealistic loved adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids shock angst obsession child amudha was outstandingly portrayed by p s keerthana her wide accusing eyes did most talking fact enigmatic characters were those nandita das her husband perhaps mani deliberately made them mysterious so as not give us overt ideas why they were way they were enigma why terrorist becomes what he or she becomes it also kept him being judgmental this was another conflict which he took no sides but merely reported while showing human tragedy kannathil muthamittal is visual poetry soul stirring drama i rarely weep movies but this one left me moist eyed little heartsick this is beautiful film treasure keeper if you can find copy beg borrow or steal one today watch film,0.5872697563874035,0.2568181818181818,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10.0,"If not perfect, what is?","The Director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian film I had seen ""Dil Se"" which led me down the path of buying well over 122 Hindi DVDs in thecourse of four months. I can say I understood the total attraction, I wassomehow confused as to why the film would stop for ""music videos"". It was an excellent movie, I didn't know what to make of the dancing and the femalevocals were a bit shrill for my western ears, but somehow I found AR Rahmen's score hypnotic. I bought the soundtrack the following day and then Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and with the exception of ""Ichi thekiller"" a few other Korean films , I can't be bothered to watch much else. Kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of Hong Kong, Horrorand Action/Science fiction films for the past 30 years. But I should get back to Kannathil Muthamittal, It is one of the Mani Ratman's latest efforts and I laughed, Cried, Got totally mad, terrified and most of all I didn't feel manipulated.

,"Sensitive, top-notch film from a great director ...","The film has Maniratnam written all over it. It is subtle in its content, yet manages to be in-your-face with some trademark-Maniratnam blunt dialogs and blunt visuals too. I've only seen Spielberg and Benigni who have managed to balance subtlety and directness wonderfully. Maniratnam is not their class but very close on their heels. At times he is better than them!The performances are superb, the production values are excellent, particularly the camera and art direction. Yet I have to mention two let downs in the movie. One is sort of major - Rahman's background score. It had a widely fluctuating quality - at times (in the final scenes and in the scenes following Amudha's birthday) bordering on superb and at times (in most of the war scenes, in the scene when Amudha sees the young LTTE girls) downright intrusive. The second one is a minor let down - editing. The movie could have used a good 10 minute trimming in the middle stages. The first half hour is a series of disjointed events thrown at you at a rapidfire pace, which may not be easy for even Tamilians to follow, not to say how difficult it is for the Western audience. Yet, being a Tamilian, while I relished the first half hour of the movie so much, I can't help but wonder how much of that brilliance remained after translating the dialogs. Personally I had a very hard time translating all the comedy in the movie when I attempted it for North Indians and Americans!That said, I have watched the movie 5 times already. I don't think I'll stop watching it anytime soon. One of the best to come out of India, heck, one of the finest movies ever made.

,Refreshingly different from the normal Indian fare pumped out into our multiplexes but a tad overdone and in need of just an extra kick in the script,"Separated from her new husband by the war, Shyama flees Shi Lanka with other refugees despite being pregnant with their child. Alone, young and with no real hope for a future Shyama puts her girl up for adoption. Years later and the girl (T. Amudha) is living with her mother and father (Indra and Thiruchelvan) happily. Despite her still being quite young, Indra and Thiuchelvan take the decision to tell Amudha that she is adopted ¬ñ causing her a certain amount of distress and making her run away fro a short time. Back home and forgiven, Thiruchelvan tells Amudha the story of how she inspired his writing and how she caused the marriage between him and Indra.Inspired by real stories of adopted children from this area, I was attracted to this film because it appeared to be different from some other Indian films I had seen (specifically not a three hour romance with an album full of songs in it). Although I am aware of the situation in Sri Lanka, I had never learnt enough to appreciate the impact on the populace in terms of refugees etc and this film did shed light on that to a certain extent. The plot focuses on the impact on Amudha ¬ñ born out of her country and into an adopted family. For no other reason than to kick-start the story, her adopted parents decide to tell her that she is adopted and seem genuinely surprised when she is upset and then wants to find her mother! This sort of thing happened a couple of times and, although it got the film moving into wider issues, it was a problem that it was written in such an unconvincing fashion and not attached to reality. This also takes away from the emotional impact because you might find the characters hard to believe in. Despite this the film is still worth seeing and just about manages to get away with the sudden sea change between small story to conflict zone footage and moralising.Of course it is still a bit moving and is generally quite interesting while avoiding the terrible clich√©s of all the Bollywood films that tend to make it to the UK cinemas. Those films are usually overblown affairs about a boy and girl in love (but with an obstacle to happiness) and loads of songs. Here the film still tends to overdo things but it is a smaller story based in reality and was more interesting and accessible to me. The script is a bit problem and the sudden move to depicting the civil war in Sri Lanka is a big step that would have been a problem had I not been interesting in it already. A big part of it working is a natural and convincing performance from first timer Keerthana. She is very good and I found myself easily caring about Amudha because of her work. Madhavan wasd a lot less convincing and was too stiff and unrealistic in his character ¬ñ maybe this sort of performance is OK in crowd-pleasing fairy tales but it was just poor for the most part in this film. Simran was pretty good but the real maternal emotion comes from Das in a small but key role in the film. With all the adults doing OK it is left to Keerthana to lead the film and she does very well apart from a few moment where you can she her giggling behind her hands when she shouldn't be.Overall this is an OK film but not as smooth and as effective as many others have said. Unlike many Indian films, the songs are restrained numbers that support the story rather than dominate it and the direction is good ¬ñ again quite restrained and good at drawing the beauty out of the surrounding as well as staging large action sequences. The acting is a bit mixed but Keerthana is impressive with a natural, convincing and likable performance.The material is a problem though as some plot turns lack any sense of reality or logic while the jump from domestic drama to social commentary and moralising is a pretty bit one and is also a jump too far.",refreshingly different normal indian fare pumped out into our multiplexes but tad overdone need just extra kick script,separated her new husband by war shyama flees shi lanka with other refugees despite being pregnant with their child alone young with no real hope future shyama puts her girl up adoption years later girl t amudha is living with her mother father indra thiruchelvan happily despite her still being quite young indra thiuchelvan take decision tell amudha that she is adopted causing her certain amount distress making her run away fro short time back home forgiven thiruchelvan tells amudha story how she inspired his writing how she caused marriage between him indra inspired by real stories adopted children this area i was attracted this film because it appeared be different some other indian films i had seen specifically not three hour romance with album full songs it although i am aware situation sri lanka i had never learnt enough appreciate impact populace terms refugees etc this film did shed light that certain extent plot focuses impact amudha born out her country into adopted family no other reason than kick start story her adopted parents decide tell her that she is adopted seem genuinely surprised when she is upset then wants find her mother this sort thing happened couple times although it got film moving into wider issues it was problem that it was written such unconvincing fashion not attached reality this also takes away emotional impact because you might find characters hard believe despite this film is still worth seeing just about manages get away with sudden sea change between small story conflict zone footage moralising course it is still bit moving is generally quite interesting while avoiding terrible clich s all bollywood films that tend make it uk cinemas those films are usually overblown affairs about boy girl love but with obstacle happiness loads songs here film still tends overdo things but it is smaller story based reality was more interesting accessible me script is bit problem sudden move depicting civil war sri lanka is big step that would have been problem had i not been interesting it already big part it working is natural convincing performance first timer keerthana she is very good i found myself easily caring about amudha because her work madhavan wasd lot less convincing was too stiff unrealistic his character maybe this sort performance is ok crowd pleasing fairy tales but it was just poor most part this film simran was pretty good but real maternal emotion comes das small but key role film with all adults doing ok it is left keerthana lead film she does very well apart few moment where you can she her giggling behind her hands when she shouldnt be overall this is ok film but not as smooth as effective as many others have said unlike many indian films songs are restrained numbers that support story rather than dominate it direction is good again quite restrained good at drawing beauty out surrounding as well as staging large action sequences acting is bit mixed but keerthana is impressive with natural convincing likable performance material is problem though as some plot turns lack any sense reality or logic while jump domestic drama social commentary moralising is pretty bit one is also jump too far,0.4780981896890989,0.17618297422274687,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"

8.0,Mani Ratnam's Sensitive and Emotional tale set in Srilanka War Conflicts.,"Kannathil Muthamittal (2002) : Brief Review -Mani Ratnam's Sensitive and Emotional tale set in Srilanka War Conflicts. There have been many Hollywood films set in War periods telling very much about how families lived those days or how some people kept their relationship intact despite deadly restrictions and some of them were even love stories. Mani Ratnam finds a big way in this War conflicts section with Kannathil Muthamittal and explores many big things in just one narrative. War Conflicts, Drama, Family, Motherhood, Childhood and a Message of Peace to improvise the next generation and what not Kannathil Muthamittal has got everything. The film is about a little girl who learns on her 9th birthday that she was adopted therefore she seeks to meet her real mother. This sensitive topic gets all what it needs from detailing in characters to suitable locations to realistic conflicts to heart touching emotions. The only thing it doesn't do is, it doesn't really give a chance to the child at the end to decide which mother to love more and why. That part could have been extended and it would have looked more subtle and detailed. Anyways, whatever it shows in about 135 minutes is nothing short of amazing experience. Mani Ratnam has grabbed everything in right manners and his storytelling ability makes it even better in cinematic terms. R Madhavan, Simran and Nandita Das are fine in thier roles but the child artist P. S. Keerthana does more than expected. Cinematography is good, background score is excellent and dialogues in many specific scenes are exceptional. Overall, Kannathil Muthamittal makes 2 to 3 good films in just one narrative and that's what makes it very special. Normally we either see a good family drama or a good emotional saga or a good war conflicts film but this is combo of all three. So, a Must See.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",mani ratnams sensitive emotional tale set srilanka war conflicts,kannathil muthamittal 2002 brief review mani ratnams sensitive emotional tale set srilanka war conflicts there have been many hollywood films set war periods telling very much about how families lived those days or how some people kept their relationship intact despite deadly restrictions some them were even love stories mani ratnam finds big way this war conflicts section with kannathil muthamittal explores many big things just one narrative war conflicts drama family motherhood childhood message peace improvise next generation what not kannathil muthamittal has got everything film is about little girl who learns her 9th birthday that she was adopted therefore she seeks meet her real mother this sensitive topic gets all what it needs detailing characters suitable locations realistic conflicts heart touching emotions only thing it doesnt do is it doesnt really give chance child at end decide which mother love more why that part could have been extended it would have looked more subtle detailed anyways whatever it shows about 135 minutes is nothing short amazing experience mani ratnam has grabbed everything right manners his storytelling ability makes it even better cinematic terms r madhavan simran nandita das are fine thier roles but child artist p s keerthana does more than expected cinematography is good background score is excellent dialogues many specific scenes are exceptional overall kannathil muthamittal makes 2 3 good films just one narrative thats what makes it very special normally we either see good family drama or good emotional saga or good war conflicts film but this is combo all three so must see rating 8 10 by,0.5261752786220872,0.28381205673758864,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,Search of a kid.,"I have seen this movie when it was released and no doubt it is heart touching. I liked the point of view of a kid who came to know that what she was thinking about her were actually not true. It's a shatter to that small kid. And her search to find out who she is. And before and after she knows about her, the relationship between her and her foster-mom. That's a nice view. A R Rahman adds his stress by a good re-recording and songs. In this movie mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advices (like in Vuyire) but simply narrates the characters as they are . And because of that the film exactly strikes the audience. The pool bath scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not convey perfectly what it meant for. Mani Ratnam has amazingly improved.21-04-2010: Now I can see how cunningly lots of scenes are put in this movie against the (so called) terrorists. E.g. The kids with guns and in terrorists uniform is a much deliberated scene to damage the freedom movement's motives. But the director clearly captures the 'deadliness' of the rebellion movement (wheel chair sequence). No leader will cry like a baby as Nandita Das cried here.

8.0,A Bit Too Long To Get To The Obvious Conclusion,"I am not a maven on Indian cinema, neither Bollywood nor Tamil, having seen only a handful of them, including Taare Zameen Par, My Name Is Khan, Outsourced, and Udaan. I have enjoyed all of the above, especially TMZ. I found ""A Peck On The Cheek"" which I saw on a Netflix DVD, to be overall an extremely well done film, with excellent effects in the war scenes, and fine performances, especially the girl who played ""Amudja"". She gave a very realistic and complex portrayal of a 9 year old, who upon finding out she was adopted (with little sensitivity by her parents), wants to find out who her biological mother was. From that point, it was a given that she would eventually connect with her. We have seen in flashback at the start of the film how her mother became married and why she gave her child up. The only reason I gave the film an 8 instead of 10, as so many have, is the journey took too long to get there. There were a number of events that took a substantial amount of time, while advancing the story very little if any. This had the effect, for me, to become a bit impatient. And the music, which was great in TMZ, seemed here to just break the flow and intensity of the film, without being relevant.Despite this, I liked the film and would recommend it, but unlike some other reviewers, I don't think I would want to watch it repeatedly, as I have done with TMZ, Outsourced, Khan, and Udaan, all of which I have purchased.

8.0,"Despite a very slow and confusing start, stick with this film","Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb.At first, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. At the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India. At a refugee center, you see the lady about to give birth--after which the titles to the film finally are revealed.The entire focus of the film then changes completely--to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras, India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family. None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing--what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film. Somehow or another, she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad #2--though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parents.Soon after this, the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film), as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused. Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way, the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother. Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents (particularly the adoptive mother) was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest.Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a very, very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants, off and on, for three decades. The family's decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble, but also a bit stupid at times--as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents--first you tell her she ISN'T your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE!!! Sure, the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother, but this really was stupid in hind sight. If it were me, I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid--thus avoiding being in the middle of a war!Despite my complaints, the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding. Far from perfect, it sure hits an emotional home run. Also, while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films, many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where--this IS standard in most films from India--including those made in Bollywood (Bombay) and Tamilwood/Kollywood (Madras).",despite very slow confusing start stick with this film,last night i saw peck cheek kannathil muthamittal with english subtitles oddly it was 137 minutes long slightly longer than time listed imdb at first i found myself losing interest this film because rather confusing style filming really lost me context what was occurring was missing i am glad i stuck with it at beginning young couple is married shortly after wedding war breaks out their native sri lanka lovers are separated months later wife is very pregnant board refugee vessel heading india at refugee center you see lady about give birth after which titles film finally are revealed entire focus film then changes completely young girl who is about turn 9 madras india you see her her home she talks camera about her life family none this seems that interesting or important you wonder what is missing what about lady who was about give birth my wife i debated this we finally guessed that this little girl was actually child lady first part film somehow or another she had been adopted was talking about her life with mom dad though she did not realize these people were not her biological parents soon after this parents revealed themselves be total idiots one complaints i had about film as they decided tell this very young girl truth about her parentage tell it way that left girl emotionally screwed up confused despite stupid decision telling her worst way parents made up this by agreeing help her find her biological mother seeing impact all this had girl parents particularly adoptive mother was impressive watch sure sparked my interest unfortunately sri lanka has been involved very very long brutal civil war with tamilese militants off three decades familys decision look mom back sri lanka was indeed noble but also bit stupid at times as they took so many risks nearly got killed again again by just blindly jumping into middle war this was all exciting captivating but also left me wondering about sanity adoptive parents first you tell her she isnt your biological child now you take her middle war zone sure kid really wanted meet her biological mother but this really was stupid hind sight if it were me i might have been tempted pay unemployed actress play part fool kid thus avoiding being middle war despite my complaints film was lovely watch was very rewarding far perfect it sure hits emotional home run also while i expected this because i have seen several indian films many westerners will be bit surprised by vivid songs that seem come out no where this is standard most films india including those made bollywood bombay tamilwood kollywood madras,0.5121232876712326,0.04115296803652968,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Absolute gold,"This film is absolute gold. If you haven't seen it, do. Mani Ratnam outdoes himself once again. This film introduced me to Nandita Das as well, though everyone shines in this movie. My only regret is I've never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs. We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of Southern India, as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer, this movie stands up to being seen again and again, and the story within the story, The Umbrella, is done so well, as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book.

10.0,Spell-binding drama,"It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Or Time, if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes, cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practises.Where does one start? The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer-author and 3 adorably naughty children? Or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies? Whichever way one looks at it, this film is worth being in your collection, if you happen to like Mani Ratnam's compelling dramas.Mr. Ratnam is a past master in blending fictional tales within real life incidents and in this film, he oozes class in adapting two real-life stories into one. I will not go into the story as it is better seen than read. But, what I will dwell upon is the impact it had upon me and why, for all the war-mongering that happens in this world, it cannot destroy that simple yet inexhaustible force called hope.Innocence, in its purity, cannot fathom the complex desires of adult decadence and greed. Nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants. It is an innocence of such nature that drives Amudha to seek her biological parents, despite warnings that they could be lost in the cauldron of civil war. Having survived a terrorizing experience of conversing with a physically challenged man only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise, Amudha sticks to her cause in a manner that tears down her well-wishers' resistance. And finally, when the twain do meet, mother and daughter, the reunion is so taut with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears. Aided by a coruscating background score from A R Rahman, the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the stoniest of hearts: a list of questions that Amudha has to ask her biological mother. In a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it, a child discovers its mother, alive in body but lost in spirit. With the crushing realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who bore her, Amudha does to her adoptive mother what this film's title means: a peck on the cheek.As for the cast, the trail is clearly blazed by the brilliant PS Keerthana. Mr. Ratnam has a gift of extracting spectacular performances from little-known child artistes, but this should take nothing away from Keerthana for an award-winning performance. With an able supporting cast of Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the stupendous Nandita Das (Shyama), she embellishes the scenes in almost every frame she is in. The music may be not as memorable as other Rahman offerings but that still didn't stop him from garnering another National Award for the best music direction. ""Vellai Pookal"" is as much an ode for the need to cherish human life as it is for nature. The dialogues are top-class (sample the touching exchange Amudha and Indira have on the swing, shortly after the revelation that she is not Indira's biological daughter) and the cinematography, superb.This film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions. Do not judge it as a lesson in film-making; you will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from the Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman stable.",spell binding drama,it pays watch readers digest or time if it was original source article that served as supposed inspiration mani ratnam make this masterpiece based true story adopted girl who goes search her biological parents mr ratnam paints classic that rivets as much as it rebukes cherishes as much as it chastens preaches as much as it practises where does one start foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife northern sri lanka chaotic household family headed by firebrand engineer author 3 adorably naughty children or that murky region where reality crosses point providing comfortable existence becomes monster incredulous sinister events ideologies whichever way one looks at it this film is worth being your collection if you happen like mani ratnams compelling dramas mr ratnam is past master blending fictional tales within real life incidents this film he oozes class adapting two real life stories into one i will not go into story as it is better seen than read but what i will dwell upon is impact it had upon me why all war mongering that happens this world it cannot destroy that simple yet inexhaustible force called hope innocence its purity cannot fathom complex desires adult decadence greed nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by fierce determination seek what it wants it is innocence such nature that drives amudha seek her biological parents despite warnings that they could be lost cauldron civil war having survived terrorizing experience conversing with physically challenged man only realize that he is more lethal entity disguise amudha sticks her cause manner that tears down her well wishers resistance finally when twain do meet mother daughter reunion is so taut with emotion that even temperamental adoptive father is reduced tears aided by coruscating background score r rahman scene that follows is poignant melt even stoniest hearts list questions that amudha has ask her biological mother culmination as dramatic as sequence incidents leading it child discovers its mother alive body but lost spirit with crushing realization that she has no hope staying with one who bore her amudha does her adoptive mother what this films title means peck cheek as cast trail is clearly blazed by brilliant ps keerthana mr ratnam has gift extracting spectacular performances little known child artistes but this should take nothing away keerthana award winning performance with able supporting cast madhavan thiru simran indira stupendous nandita das shyama she embellishes scenes almost every frame she is music may be not as memorable as other rahman offerings but that still didnt stop him garnering another national award best music direction vellai pookal is as much ode need cherish human life as it is nature dialogues are top class sample touching exchange amudha indira have swing shortly after revelation that she is not indiras biological daughter cinematography superb this film is clear statement drop arms as much as it is respect human life expressions do not judge it as lesson film making you will only lose out experiencing one very best mani ratnam r rahman stable,0.4681010101010101,0.18558080808080807,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.36}"
