10.0,"""He travels the fastest who travels alone""","There are some great WW1 films out there, the granddaddy of them all in my view being 1930's 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. Also appreciate many of the actors here, though they are in cameo roles, and Sam Mendes as a director (of the films of his seen, almost all, 'Spectre' is the only one to not do much for me). Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman are masters in their field, Deakins is one of the best cinematographers in the business and Newman's score for 'Road to Perdition' is a favourite.'1917' was seen for all those reasons. As well as because of the critical acclaim, with it being considered as one of 2019's year's best films. After seeing it, my thoughts are that the acclaim for '1917' is richly deserved in one of the best and most powerful films that year. It did connect a lot with me, due to watching it not long after reading the harrowing war diaries of my great-grandfather (who fought in the war and was mustard gassed and blinded).First and foremost, '1917' is a visual and technical achievement. It is beautifully and evocatively designed and Deakins' cinematography, with awe-inspiring and never gimmicky use of the long unbroken one take technique, is nothing short of masterful. Mendes ensures that the tension, even in the slower moments, never slips, keeping the intensity (at its best almost nerve-shredding) going.Newman provides another hauntingly beautiful score, that does stir the emotions in the latter parts of the film when things become more urgent. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity, so much so it was like being there. The film is intelligently scripted and to me the two lead characters, especially Scofield, were easy to get behind, interesting and their bond came over as realistic. The story is engrossing throughout, it briefly loses a little momentum just before the climax perhaps, but the first half is emotionally powerful and the climax is unpredictably intense.Such a good job is done too with showing the full horrors of war from a visual standpoint, a psychological one and in the unflinching action. Without going too far, the point of view not being hammered home. '1917' benefits hugely from the splendid lead performance of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman is strong too despite his role not being quite as meaty. The cameos from Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden and Andrew Scott manage to make big impressions in short screen time.Overall, brilliant and powerful film. One of the best films personally watched in 2020. 10/10.",he travels fastest who travels alone,there are some great ww1 films out there granddaddy them all my view being 1930s all quiet western front also appreciate many actors here though they are cameo roles sam mendes as director films his seen almost all spectre is only one not do much me roger deakins thomas newman are masters their field deakins is one best cinematographers business newmans score road perdition is favourite 1917 was seen all those reasons as well as because critical acclaim with it being considered as one 2019s years best films after seeing it my thoughts are that acclaim 1917 is richly deserved one best most powerful films that year it did connect lot with me due watching it not long after reading harrowing war diaries my great grandfather who fought war was mustard gassed blinded first foremost 1917 is visual technical achievement it is beautifully evocatively designed deakins cinematography with awe inspiring never gimmicky use long unbroken one take technique is nothing short masterful mendes ensures that tension even slower moments never slips keeping intensity at its best almost nerve shredding going newman provides another hauntingly beautiful score that does stir emotions latter parts film when things become more urgent sound is thrilling its authenticity so much so it was like being there film is intelligently scripted me two lead characters especially scofield were easy get behind interesting their bond came over as realistic story is engrossing throughout it briefly loses little momentum just before climax perhaps but first half is emotionally powerful climax is unpredictably intense such good job is done too with showing full horrors war visual standpoint psychological one unflinching action without going too far point view not being hammered home 1917 benefits hugely splendid lead performance george mackay dean charles chapman is strong too despite his role not being quite as meaty cameos benedict cumberbatch colin firth richard madden andrew scott manage make big impressions short screen time overall brilliant powerful film one best films personally watched 2020 10 10,0.5236338797814208,0.31372950819672124,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Reasonably accurate in showing the hell that is war.,"I am not particularly a huge fan of war films. Much of it is because they too often glamorize war or present bullet-proof heroes who are anything but realistic. However, I am glad I watched ""1917"" because neither of these problems exist in the story plus it's a very good depiction of war and the awfulness of it...particularly WWI.The story is very simple...two lance corporals are sent on a mad dash across enemy territory to alert troops on the other side of this no-man's land that they are walking into a trap. The film shows their journey and the thrilling finale.The plot is among the simplest I've seen in a war film and the movie is really about action and the men's struggle to sneak across the battlefield and alert their troops....simple. Yet it was made so thoughtfully and realistically that it really worked well. A brilliantly made film...among the best I've seen about war. But it's also very graphic and unpleasant....so be forewarned.",reasonably accurate showing hell that is war,i am not particularly huge fan war films much it is because they too often glamorize war or present bullet proof heroes who are anything but realistic however i am glad i watched 1917 because neither these problems exist story plus its very good depiction war awfulness it particularly wwi story is very simple two lance corporals are sent mad dash across enemy territory alert troops other side this no mans land that they are walking into trap film shows their journey thrilling finale plot is among simplest ive seen war film movie is really about action mens struggle sneak across battlefield alert their troops simple yet it was made so thoughtfully realistically that it really worked well brilliantly made film among best ive seen about war but its also very graphic unpleasant so be forewarned,0.53078231292517,0.18063492063492065,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,Another Day In One Long Take,"The command has realized that the Germans have pulled back for a trap on a British offensive. The telephone lines are cut, and the only way to get the orders through to the colonel commanding the offensive is to send two soldiers through the lines. One of them has special incentive. His elder brother is a soldier in the attack. If it goes through, 1600 men, will be wiped out for no purpose.... including the soldier's brother.It's a classic story-telling format that dates back to the ANABASIS: get from point A to Point B, only here it's just two men traveling through the alternating inferno of the Great War's front lines, and the bucolic springtime of northern France. Effective as that is, director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have shot it, as near as they could manage, as one long take - after I had realized what they were doing, about twenty minutes into the film, I began to look for ways of editing things together. While I spotted a few, there was really only one obvious spot, and that was after more than an hour had passed.This deliberate effort to make this movie in this manner clearly has a point. It is a constant barrage, one long cinematic sentence that must be swallowed whole. It forces the viewer to take it all in in one piece, giving, perhaps, a hint of the overwhelming sensory overload of this struggle to get through.It certainly worked on me.",another day one long take,command has realized that germans have pulled back trap british offensive telephone lines are cut only way get orders through colonel commanding offensive is send two soldiers through lines one them has special incentive his elder brother is soldier attack if it goes through 1600 men will be wiped out no purpose including soldiers brother its classic story telling format that dates back anabasis get point point b only here its just two men traveling through alternating inferno great wars front lines bucolic springtime northern france effective as that is director sam mendes cinematographer roger deakins have shot it as near as they could manage as one long take after i had realized what they were doing about twenty minutes into film i began look ways editing things together while i spotted few there was really only one obvious spot that was after more than hour had passed this deliberate effort make this movie this manner clearly has point it is constant barrage one long cinematic sentence that must be swallowed whole it forces viewer take it all one piece giving perhaps hint overwhelming sensory overload this struggle get through it certainly worked me,0.4728778467908903,0.13861283643892341,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.48}"
8.0,"1917 recruits you to experience a war journey done in an impressive ""one-shot"" style that I can't say i've seen before","Saving Private Ryan, 30 Seconds over Tokyo, Patton, Inglorious Bastards, The Great Escape and Schindler's List are only a few of the countless movies about World War II that have been made. In fact, many are still made today. So why haven't there been a lot of movies about the first World War? I think it comes down to exactly what was being fought for and what it meant for everyone. Everyone can agree that Nazism is bad and running a nation as a dictatorship robs everyone of their freedom. Germany was a common enemy that everyone would want to fight, similar to a simple film's goal of good against evil.While World War I may have not had a simple enemy to get behind, it's still an important war as it collapsed several European empires, set the stage for a revolution in Russia, put the U.S. in a larger military position and unfortunately led to the deaths of millions. What movies can do is really put us in the position of those solders to see the magnitude of warfare and it's path of devastation. This may make 1917 one of the most intense movies to sit through, but an important one to witness.In the misty month of April in 1917, English soldiers are resting after seeing the Germans pulling back from the western front. Two solders, Blake (played by Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (played by George MacKay) are assigned to deliver a message to another Battalion. They receive more information from General Erinmore (played by Colin Firth), where they find out that the 2nd Battalion , which is assuming an easy victory, is about to walk into a deadly battle with most of the German offensive attacking there. With the phone lines cut, both Blake and Schofield are instructed to cross No Man's Land to find the Battalion and deliver a message to not attack.Plot wise, that's all you need to know about 1917. The rest of the movie follows these two men as they cross over the horror that is No Man's Land, abandoned German trenches and everything else that would scare any soldier crossing the lines. What separates this from a lot of other war movies is that the entire film is created to appear that everything is done in one continuous shot, never taking the perspective away from the main characters. This also includes time and light, depending whether it's day or night.Even with it's ambition, 1917 is still a phenomenal movie that's an experience that gave my heart a large rush. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) clearly wanted to give audiences the best way to experience the trenches and gunshots and did so through this one shot story. Birdman may have done something similar, but given how many extras and special effects went off, I would love to see a behind the scenes look at how everything was done. The cinematography pays a lot of detail to little things like the color of the sky during sunrise and how much paler skin would become after death.The story feels a lot like something out of theme park or a video game...and I mean that in a good way. You're aware that your watching someone else's experience , but the right angles do make you feel like you're a part of it. Where 1917 endures in the story is it's simple goal while going through several layers of warfare Hell. I could see this getting boring quick, but despite it's one shot goal, every scene still has a different look that never feels too familiar. The movie knows not to stop for too long unless it was for an important reason. It's a rush.Does this movie into the bigger political or social impact of World War I? No, but that was never the intention. It's like watching someone's small story that is large in scale. If I did have any problems is that there's a point where a character is knocked out and he's awoken. I won't say where, but it broke part of the spell that the movie put me in. You can tell it's a point where they were hiding an edit, but if the movie had a bunch of them in plain sight, you'd think they could have done better.I'll give this eight dogfight planes out of ten. Like a lot of war movies, this isn't a pleasant experience. It isn't supposed to be; it's meant to be a tool to really give you something that a lot of people have forgotten about as WWI movies aren't made a lot. I highly recommend this if your willing to see something that I can't say I could make myself.",1917 recruits you experience war journey done impressive one shot style that i cant say ive seen before,saving private ryan 30 seconds over tokyo patton inglorious bastards great escape schindlers list are only few countless movies about world war ii that have been made fact many are still made today so why havent there been lot movies about first world war i think it comes down exactly what was being fought what it meant everyone everyone can agree that nazism is bad running nation as dictatorship robs everyone their freedom germany was common enemy that everyone would want fight similar simple films goal good against evil while world war i may have not had simple enemy get behind its still important war as it collapsed several european empires set stage revolution russia put u s larger military position unfortunately led deaths millions what movies can do is really put us position those solders see magnitude warfare its path devastation this may make 1917 one most intense movies sit through but important one witness misty month april 1917 english soldiers are resting after seeing germans pulling back western front two solders blake played by dean charles chapman schofield played by george mackay are assigned deliver message another battalion they receive more information general erinmore played by colin firth where they find out that 2nd battalion which is assuming easy victory is about walk into deadly battle with most german offensive attacking there with phone lines cut both blake schofield are instructed cross no mans land find battalion deliver message not attack plot wise thats all you need know about 1917 rest movie follows these two men as they cross over horror that is no mans land abandoned german trenches everything else that would scare any soldier crossing lines what separates this lot other war movies is that entire film is created appear that everything is done one continuous shot never taking perspective away main characters this also includes time light depending whether its day or night even with its ambition 1917 is still phenomenal movie thats experience that gave my heart large rush director sam mendes american beauty skyfall clearly wanted give audiences best way experience trenches gunshots did so through this one shot story birdman may have done something similar but given how many extras special effects went off i would love see behind scenes look at how everything was done cinematography pays lot detail little things like color sky during sunrise how much paler skin would become after death story feels lot like something out theme park or video game i mean that good way youre aware that your watching someone elses experience but right angles do make you feel like youre part it where 1917 endures story is its simple goal while going through several layers warfare hell i could see this getting boring quick but despite its one shot goal every scene still has different look that never feels too familiar movie knows not stop too long unless it was important reason its rush does this movie into bigger political or social impact world war i no but that was never intention its like watching someones small story that is large scale if i did have any problems is that theres point where character is knocked out hes awoken i wont say where but it broke part spell that movie put me you can tell its point where they were hiding edit but if movie had bunch them plain sight youd think they could have done better ill give this eight dogfight planes out ten like lot war movies this isnt pleasant experience it isnt supposed be its meant be tool really give you something that lot people have forgotten about as wwi movies arent made lot i highly recommend this if your willing see something that i cant say i could make myself,0.4567568972033257,0.10430461073318213,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"

But then it shouldn't waste too much time either, it should be faster paced, there should always be something to look at that's actually interesting. The stapled corpses get boring at some point.The biggest problem I had with this movie, were the unnecessary coincidences. 1) The germans take every step to not leave food or anything behind, yet there is exactly 1 cow and 1 milk bucket left. Which leads to 2) In the town the protagonist jump exactly into this 1 house wherw there's also a baby that needs this milk. 3) The rat. It just runs into the trap exactly when our protagonists are there. Of course. 4) The plane. You guessed it: It lands exactly at our heroes feet. And they decide to help the german guy (why?) which leads to Blakes death.Other than that, the movie really was spectacular and a feast for this eyes.

8.0,A technical masterpiece,"Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still a young lad. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.Roger Deakins' (Blade Runner 2049) cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's (Passengers) score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Chapman (Game of Thrones) do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Mark Strong (Shazam!), Richard Madden (Rocketman) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange) are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes.",technical masterpiece,sam mendes war drama is set during world war i very personal him as it tells story his grandfather used tell him when he was still young lad dedicated mendes hero this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers mission deliver message that could possibly save thousands fellow combatants filmed edited as if it was one long take camera never leaves our main protagonists blake dean charles chapman schofield george mackay out its sight mendes skyfall co writer krysty wilson cairns penny dreadful therefore corner themselves by relying this kind linear storytelling tell very focused but at times somewhat thin tale some scenes are so empty it will sure test audiences patience technical 1917 is true feast eyes ears roger deakins blade runner 2049 cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior anything else youve seen this year sure will be one thing people unanimously praise sound editing mixing visual effects production design are all outstanding these are things people will remember it is thomas newmans passengers score that elevates every moment happening front you intensifying emotions brought by our main characters although mackay captain fantastic chapman game thrones do pretty phenomenal job at capturing true essence their characters going through literal hell its side characters with little no screen time who steal their spotlight andrew scott fleabag mark strong shazam richard madden rocketman benedict cumberbatch dr strange are checkpoints along way but man do they impress with few lines theyre given 1917 is without doubt technical masterpiece that will inspire many filmmakers but i cant feel bit let down as overall film it wants play heavy tune your heartstrings but cant reach that level sentiment because focus technicalities pulled me out story it sure is one better films 2019 has brought big screen yet bit more focus script couldve made this cinematic masterpiece decade nonetheless i recommend watching this biggest screen possible enjoy another fine piece cinema brought you by sam mendes,0.5026790123456791,0.1442283950617284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,One of the greatest war films,"I am pretty late to reviewing 1917, I saw it as soon as it came out in theatres and by God is this a cinematic experience!

At times, it can get a bit overwhelming, I must admit. There were many times during the film where I would burst into tears!The hype is real, watch this movie if you haven't! One thing that made me really sad is that this film did not win ""Best Picture"" Oscar, sure, you can say Parasite all you want, but at the end of the day 1917 is a practically flawless film.

His script was amazing, the dialogue is fantastic, that little scene with Benedict Cumberbatch was awesome, everything about this movie hit the right note.I don't want to make this review too long, but I strongly reccommend that you watch this movie, the main performances are excellent, cinematography is next level and it is war movie perfection.",one greatest war films,i am pretty late reviewing 1917 i saw it as soon as it came out theatres by god is this cinematic experience if you didnt see this movie cinema what were you doing i mean seriously what were you wasting your time because this movie is amazing ive seen many great films this decade dont get me wrong but 1917 has be one best atmosphere cinematography this movie makes you feel like youre part war roger deakins is easily greatest cinematographer working today that is just straight fact at times it can get bit overwhelming i must admit there were many times during film where i would burst into tears hype is real watch this movie if you havent one thing that made me really sad is that this film did not win best picture oscar sure you can say parasite all you want but at end day 1917 is practically flawless film like ive said feel this film is mastered so well by roger deakins very well deserved his oscar win best cinematography category one thing i havent mentioned yet is that sam mendes directs sh out this movie his script was amazing dialogue is fantastic that little scene with benedict cumberbatch was awesome everything about this movie hit right note i dont want make this review too long but i strongly reccommend that you watch this movie main performances are excellent cinematography is next level it is war movie perfection,0.6351598972922502,0.3633053221288515,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,1917,"Absolutely incredible - I've seen it 3 times in cinemas and each time I find myself even more in awe of, blown away by, and in love with this film. It's thrilling, tense, gentle, satisfying, and deeply beautiful. As a huge fan of the war genre, this is unlike any other film I've ever seen - it finds its true strength in its unexciting, human moments rather than in the mindless chaos of firefights, while still managing to have some of the most exhilarating and edge-of-your-seat segments I've ever seen. Schofield is a brilliant and unconventional choice for the lead character, and his empathy and softness have made him one of my favourite characters of all time and an exceptionally rare example of how quiet tenderness truly can carry a war film better than loud banter and hyper-masculine bluster so often does. Krysty Wilson-Cairns is a genius and George Mackay said so much more in Schofield's silence than most actors could hope to in the grandest monologue.

8.0,"A technical marvel, 1917's one-shot conceit is immersive and affecting","1917 is a very good film in general, but it's the way it's shot that marks it as an artistically cutting-edge film. It brings the technical excellence of Dunkirk, with great war sets and brutally realistic depictions of the intensity of war, but intelligently turns to a humanist angle in telling a simple story of two men trying to help their country's men. There are no bad elements of 1917, but it's the phenomenal execution of the one-shot technique that makes it great. The tracking shots in the trenches made me realize how much less immersive it is to be constantly cut to the front of the next shot, rather than seeing the path the characters take. Given that it's this one epic journey, it is fitting to go on it with Schofield the whole way. The colors and big war shots (especially Schofield running across the war zone to reach the captain and him jumping into the river) were gorgeous. The score is essential, ratcheting tension up quickly in scenes like the rat trip wire and also calming it down in personal scenes like one character's death and when Schofield meets the baby and woman. War is so extreme and all-encompassing that it's truly difficult for any film to accurately capture it, but 1917 belongs up there with the best efforts. It is a film of brutality and loyalty, but above all it's a beautiful work of art about one of the ugliest subjects known to man.",technical marvel 1917s one shot conceit is immersive affecting,1917 is very good film general but its way its shot that marks it as artistically cutting edge film it brings technical excellence dunkirk with great war sets brutally realistic depictions intensity war but intelligently turns humanist angle telling simple story two men trying help their countrys men there are no bad elements 1917 but its phenomenal execution one shot technique that makes it great tracking shots trenches made me realize how much less immersive it is be constantly cut front next shot rather than seeing path characters take given that its this one epic journey it is fitting go it with schofield whole way colors big war shots especially schofield running across war zone reach captain him jumping into river were gorgeous score is essential ratcheting tension up quickly scenes like rat trip wire also calming it down personal scenes like one characters death when schofield meets baby woman war is so extreme all encompassing that its truly difficult any film accurately capture it but 1917 belongs up there with best efforts it is film brutality loyalty but above all its beautiful work art about one ugliest subjects known man,0.5083666154633898,0.22299283154121866,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.3}"

10.0,Review from a combat veteran.,"Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn't ""bond"" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are ""walking"" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of ""shell shock,"" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch ""They Shall Never Grow Old,"" an exceptional documentary.",review combat veteran,last night col ferry i col coldwell both usa were able watch new wwi film 1917 before it has national release it is cinematographic feast eyes long expansive shots that follow protagonists as they execute their mission it does not hide horrors that existed trench warfare it shows them their brutality abundance my great uncle died as consequence his service fighting trenches mustard gas poisoning many ways it reminded me saving private ryan those who have served combat i have deployments iraq afghanistan i cannot tell you if film will be too difficult watch it might well be especially if incoming artillery is trigger me as camera travels few inches above dirt advancing slowly up berm my response was visceral i was taken back patrols we walked afghanistan not knowing what was around corner not relaxing heightened vigilance not knowing if there would be ied child wearing suicide vest sniper taking aim protagonists this film as all who served are serving surviving climb up berm there is no sigh relief no respite fear uncertainty they we survive move forward face more uncertainty watching allowed me pay homage my great uncle approximate 800 000 other brits who were killed or died as consequence their service germany lost over 2 million soldiers war estimates put total casualty numbers both military civilians at 40 million half killed or died wounds infection i rate this film as 10 10 many reasons directing acting set design cinematography musical score raw emotion it invokes some critics have said they never felt connection with characters i suspect they never served combat while brotherhood including female war fighters is strong there is also common characteristic possessed by all war fighters ability focus mission suppress emotion even as those around fighter fall this was quality i recognized actors why viewer doesnt bond with main protagonists we viewer were mission with them we grieve as we can move watch if you will but know there is no pleasure watching film will grab you beginning not let you go even though we know outcome wwi there is no joy there is no peace watch because it will allow you glimpse at horror brutality war reflect their service sacrifice note as we viewer are walking through trenches glancing shots young soldiers shows them with flat affect isolation almost apathy this is face shell shock what we know call post traumatic stress disorder original ww1 footage watch they shall never grow old exceptional documentary,0.3807542884465961,0.059331480485326646,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8.0,Huge technical achievement,"Two young British soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are tasked with a mission to carry a message far beyond enemy lines which could save 1600 men from walking straight into a trap.I am personally not a huge fan of WW1 and WW2 movies, but there's no denying the fact that this movie is a huge technical achievement. Roger Deakins is one of the best cinematographers of our time. Some shots are mind-blowing. It's hard to imagine how it was shot. Every movie Deakins is involved with looks astonishing and 1917 is no exception. The score, sound editing/mixing, visual effects, and production design are all outstanding.1917 is shot and edited to look like one continuous shot, but that is not the case. This illusion was created with camera trickery and great editing. Sometimes you're able to tell when the camera cuts when darkness obscures the screen for a second or when the camera passes by a wall. Contrary to popular belief, the longest scenes were according to one of the lead actors, Dean-Charles Chapman, only 7- or 8-minutes.I can't begin to fathom the amount of preparation and planning that went into this movie. Creating a war movie to look like one shot from start to finish is not an easy task. It took extreme planning from the director and the cinematographer.The actors give great performances. I did at first not find Chapman and Mackay's performances to be very believable, but it took a quick turn. I did not find it very appropriate for Blake to be cracking jokes whilst being in constant danger. But suddenly the tables flipped, and it got more serious which I enjoyed.When Blake is bleeding out, we can see his face turn pale. This was done without the use of special effects or makeup. I don't know how it's possible, but his face is naturally flushed with color. I think this was an amazing detail and I had no clue it was done without the use of makeup or special effects.Some people might find 1917 to be lacking character and some might call it a ""gimmick film"", which I understand but I don't fully concur. While the plot is simple, the movie still has heart and great action. The last sequence when Schofield is searching for Colonel Mackenzie is great.The first 10 minutes of the movie were flawless. I was engaged and I was thinking how this would be my favorite movie of all time, but I don't think the rest of the movie held this standard. 1917 is still technically one of the greatest movies of all time and it's an enjoyable watch too. I highly recommend you watch it.",huge technical achievement,two young british soldiers blake dean charles chapman schofield george mackay are tasked with mission carry message far beyond enemy lines which could save 1600 men walking straight into trap i am personally not huge fan ww1 ww2 movies but theres no denying fact that this movie is huge technical achievement roger deakins is one best cinematographers our time some shots are mind blowing its hard imagine how it was shot every movie deakins is involved with looks astonishing 1917 is no exception score sound editing mixing visual effects production design are all outstanding 1917 is shot edited look like one continuous shot but that is not case this illusion was created with camera trickery great editing sometimes youre able tell when camera cuts when darkness obscures screen second or when camera passes by wall contrary popular belief longest scenes were according one lead actors dean charles chapman only 7 or 8 minutes i cant begin fathom amount preparation planning that went into this movie creating war movie look like one shot start finish is not easy task it took extreme planning director cinematographer actors give great performances i did at first not find chapman mackays performances be very believable but it took quick turn i did not find it very appropriate blake be cracking jokes whilst being constant danger but suddenly tables flipped it got more serious which i enjoyed when blake is bleeding out we can see his face turn pale this was done without use special effects or makeup i dont know how its possible but his face is naturally flushed with color i think this was amazing detail i had no clue it was done without use makeup or special effects some people might find 1917 be lacking character some might call it gimmick film which i understand but i dont fully concur while plot is simple movie still has heart great action last sequence when schofield is searching colonel mackenzie is great first 10 minutes movie were flawless i was engaged i was thinking how this would be my favorite movie all time but i dont think rest movie held this standard 1917 is still technically one greatest movies all time its enjoyable watch too i highly recommend you watch it,0.5633006535947713,0.28099906629318394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.23}"

10.0,One of the greatest war movies of all time,"This is hands down one of the greatest war movies to ever hit the silver screen along with being very unique. The hell of the WWI battlefield is a subject that hasn't been covered in a long time and Mr. Mendes executes this perfectly. A movie like this couldn't have been made 50 years ago but with today's advances in film making along with a large studio budget Mr. Mendes takes us through an adventure every bit as harrowing as Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line.The use of the single shot was brilliant as it brings the viewer along in the trenches and further adds to the realism to the film. I was surprised to hear that this was gimmicky effect from some critics, I feel Mr. Mendes nailed it brilliantly with the help of some fantastic cinematography. The set pieces were so realistic and detailed, a lesser director would've focused more on them but for this ride the camera never stops moving and it's a benefit to the film.There was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film. The dialogue was great and certainly was a key component of making the single shot method work here. There is no pointless exposition in the movie.This isn't a piece to glorify war but rather demonstrate how one can be brave all the while showing their vulnerabilities and fear that any normal person would feel in that type of situation. There are no gratuitous bits in the film to exemplify heroism, just a simple story that allows the characters to shine and define bravery on their own terms.From the acting, to the score, to the cinematography, editing and overall direction of the film Mr. Mendes absolutely knocked it out of the park. This isn't just one of the best war movies of all time, I believe it's truly one of the best pieces of film to ever grace the big screen. 1917 will leave you breathless and for many like myself, in tears when the journey comes to and end.Bravo!!",one greatest war movies all time,this is hands down one greatest war movies ever hit silver screen along with being very unique hell wwi battlefield is subject that hasnt been covered long time mr mendes executes this perfectly movie like this couldnt have been made 50 years ago but with todays advances film making along with large studio budget mr mendes takes us through adventure every bit as harrowing as saving private ryan thin red line use single shot was brilliant as it brings viewer along trenches further adds realism film i was surprised hear that this was gimmicky effect some critics i feel mr mendes nailed it brilliantly with help some fantastic cinematography set pieces were so realistic detailed lesser director wouldve focused more them but this ride camera never stops moving its benefit film there was no slow part movie audience is enthralled with journey first minute film dialogue was great certainly was key component making single shot method work here there is no pointless exposition movie this isnt piece glorify war but rather demonstrate how one can be brave all while showing their vulnerabilities fear that any normal person would feel that type situation there are no gratuitous bits film exemplify heroism just simple story that allows characters shine define bravery their own terms acting score cinematography editing overall direction film mr mendes absolutely knocked it out park this isnt just one best war movies all time i believe its truly one best pieces film ever grace big screen 1917 will leave you breathless many like myself tears when journey comes end bravo,0.5727545489740612,0.2925038714672861,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,"""We need to keep movin'. Come on!""","Impressively filmed, the movie's staging, set design, lighting, cinematography and choreographed action sequences are all top notch and deserving of recognition. I should mention the soundtrack as well, which complements the story as two young soldiers progress their way through No Man's land to deliver an urgent message to a distant unit that faces annihilation. The film makers wisely selected two relatively lesser know actors for the film's protagonists so that celebrity wouldn't get in the way of the story. I was somewhat surprised that Dean-Charles Chapman, portraying Lance Corporal Blake, didn't make it to the end of the movie. His death before mid-picture left Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) the unenviable task of making his way alone across enemy held territory to complete an almost impossible mission. Among a number of astonishing scenes, I was most impressed with the German plane crash that came within inches of claiming the lives of both men. Though the picture claims it's status as being filmed in one continuous tracking shot, there appear at least one or two instances where that might not have been the case, one in particular being quite obvious, even if masked rather well. Even so, the technique may very well earn Sam Mendes the Best Directing Oscar, along with Cinematography and Production Design. The trenches and battleground scenes are particularly impressive, especially near the finale in which the British unit prepares for it's assault. In any case, the picture stands as a worthy achievement in film making, and is especially recommended.",we need keep movin come,impressively filmed movies staging set design lighting cinematography choreographed action sequences are all top notch deserving recognition i should mention soundtrack as well which complements story as two young soldiers progress their way through no mans land deliver urgent message distant unit that faces annihilation film makers wisely selected two relatively lesser know actors films protagonists so that celebrity wouldnt get way story i was somewhat surprised that dean charles chapman portraying lance corporal blake didnt make it end movie his death before mid picture left lance corporal schofield george mackay unenviable task making his way alone across enemy held territory complete almost impossible mission among number astonishing scenes i was most impressed with german plane crash that came within inches claiming lives both men though picture claims its status as being filmed one continuous tracking shot there appear at least one or two instances where that might not have been case one particular being quite obvious even if masked rather well even so technique may very well earn sam mendes best directing oscar along with cinematography production design trenches battleground scenes are particularly impressive especially near finale which british unit prepares its assault any case picture stands as worthy achievement film making is especially recommended,0.5549382716049385,0.26049382716049385,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,"Engaging, but the technical delivery carries the weakness in the narrative","This is an impressive bit of filmmaking, and it won 3 Oscars for just that - however the areas of the wins are quite telling and fit with my experience of watching it. The wins were all technical in nature, which is fitting because 1917 is a film that very much impresses on its delivery first, and its content a reasonably distant second. It is sort of understandable, because the central plot is about rushed forward motion, and this does mean limited opportunity for the film is flesh out its characters and scenario. It does have a go at it, and does reasonably well, but mostly this aspect is a weakness.In terms of tension and thrills, it does well at its best, producing many good set-pieces through the run-time. The downside of this is that sustained periods without big moments, or engaging smaller drama, do give an up/down feeling to the pace of delivery. Broadly though, it flows well and takes the viewer along with it. Main reason though was the technical delivery. I am a sucker for a ""single-shot"" delivery, so I was already open to loving this film on that basis alone. Okay it is not one single take so much as a series of takes (longest of which is 8 minutes), but this is still hugely impressive and it gives the film the sense of movement and momentum that the narrative benefits from. Cinematography, lighting, sound, editing, effects - all the technical aspects come together impressively and it enough to carry the film over the weaknesses in other areas. The cast occasionally distract by virtue of their fame, but mostly they work well, and the two young leads sell their situations well.Overall though, I still ended the film thinking about the technical aspects than I was about the characters or the film as a whole - which isn't a good situation. When I watched The Irishman, I quickly stopped noticing the de-aging technology and just got into the film; however here the same didn't happen consistently - I found I was broken out of the film and was focused on the camera movement, editing etc.",engaging but technical delivery carries weakness narrative,this is impressive bit filmmaking it won 3 oscars just that however areas wins are quite telling fit with my experience watching it wins were all technical nature which is fitting because 1917 is film that very much impresses its delivery first its content reasonably distant second it is sort understandable because central plot is about rushed forward motion this does mean limited opportunity film is flesh out its characters scenario it does have go at it does reasonably well but mostly this aspect is weakness terms tension thrills it does well at its best producing many good set pieces through run time downside this is that sustained periods without big moments or engaging smaller drama do give up down feeling pace delivery broadly though it flows well takes viewer along with it main reason though was technical delivery i am sucker single shot delivery so i was already open loving this film that basis alone okay it is not one single take so much as series takes longest which is 8 minutes but this is still hugely impressive it gives film sense movement momentum that narrative benefits cinematography lighting sound editing effects all technical aspects come together impressively it enough carry film over weaknesses other areas cast occasionally distract by virtue their fame but mostly they work well two young leads sell their situations well overall though i still ended film thinking about technical aspects than i was about characters or film as whole which isnt good situation when i watched irishman i quickly stopped noticing de aging technology just got into film however here same didnt happen consistently i found i was broken out film was focused camera movement editing etc,0.3842396825396825,0.2023031746031746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"

Wasn't sure if I was going to like that that approach to filming but it worked for this film.The movie looked fantastic and the scenes and shots were breath taking. Sound and music score really helped a viewer on an emotional level as well.While I was engrossed and drawn into this film from start to finish, after it was over and I had time to reflect on it, I found it not the profound masterpiece others have stated it as.The plot in general was unrealistic - there are better ways to deliver a message than sending two soldiers across enemy lines and relying on luck and hope.Some of the scenes dragged as well, which caused the movie to lose momentum for me. Felt the build up often yes, but then there would be scene that made me lose interest (truck ride. French woman & baby).Acting wasn't spectacular either, from anyone in the film. You can have all the explosions and battle scenes you want that look great, but if the actors can't carry the script along it won't work as a whole. This is why the comparisons that mention Saving Private Ryan don't work for me - those actors drew you in with their performances. That didn't happen here, and between the acting and the momentum losing scenes, is why I cant rate this film any higher.Close, but missed the mark for a perfect film, but a good watch none the less.",good but not great,one shot look this movie was interesting wasnt sure if i was going like that that approach filming but it worked this film movie looked fantastic scenes shots were breath taking sound music score really helped viewer emotional level as well while i was engrossed drawn into this film start finish after it was over i had time reflect it i found it not profound masterpiece others have stated it as plot general was unrealistic there are better ways deliver message than sending two soldiers across enemy lines relying luck hope some scenes dragged as well which caused movie lose momentum me felt build up often yes but then there would be scene that made me lose interest truck ride french woman baby acting wasnt spectacular either anyone film you can have all explosions battle scenes you want that look great but if actors cant carry script along it wont work as whole this is why comparisons that mention saving private ryan dont work me those actors drew you with their performances that didnt happen here between acting momentum losing scenes is why i cant rate this film any higher close but missed mark perfect film but good watch none less,0.542632850241546,0.247463768115942,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
