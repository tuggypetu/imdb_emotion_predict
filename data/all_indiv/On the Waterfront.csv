8.0,"Powerful portrait of N.Y. docks , being stunningly performed and excellently directed by Elia Kazan","This compelling and dynamic drama is set on New York's dock where mobsters control the Union and stevedores . An ex-prize fighter named Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando who deservedly won an Academy Award) turned longshoreman struggles to stand up to his corrupt union bosses (Lee J Cobb) and is embroiled in violence . Malloy faces the terrible dilemma of whether or not to turn informer . While his brother (it was originally offered to Lawrence Tierney , but he asked for too much money so the role went to Rod Steiger who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance) is a crooked lawyer and he meets a beautiful ex-nun (Eva Maria Saint , Grace Kelly turned down the role of Edie Doyle, deciding to make Rear Window instead) and falls in love for her .This is an interesting and thought-provoking film with attractive plot by screenwriter Budd Schulberg , containing intense drama with pungent lines , emotion , wonderful performances , memorable climax , magnificent direction and classic musical score by maestro Leonard Berstein . For this brooding film and highy charged throughout story writer Budd Schulberg took the idea from newspapers , as he started with an expose series written for The New York Sun by reporter Malcolm Johnson , the articles won him a Pulitzer Prize and were reinforced by the 1948 murder of a New York dock hiring boss which woke America to the killings , graft and extortion that were endemic on the New York waterfront . Marvelous acting by entire casting . Marlon Brando is perfect as stevedore who faces the thorny dilemma of whether or not to become himself into an unfortunate informer . The taxicab scene , one of the most known scenes in the cinema, in which Brando began to improvise some dialogue , while surprising Rod Steiger listened and Kazan simply stood back and let the two actors direct themselves . Along with first-rate main cast : Brando , Steiger , Eva Maria Saint , appearing here and there great secondaries giving nice interpretations , such as : Lee J. Cobb , Leif Erickson , Michel V. Gazzo, Pat Henning , James Westerfield , Martin Balsam , Pat Hingle , Nehemiah Persoff, among others . Being film debuts of Michael V. Gazzo, Pat Hingle, Martin Balsam, and Eva Marie Saint . The leading characters were based on real people: Terry Malloy was based on longshoreman and whistle-blower Anthony De Vincenzo ; Father Barry was based on waterfront priest John M. Corridan ; Johnny Friendly was based on mobster Albert Anastasia. On the Waterfront is widely known to be an act of expiation on the part of Elia Kazan for naming names to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) during the Joseph McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950s.This trend-setting film has a gritty portrait of N. Y. waterfront and stand up well nowadays and resulted to be a huge financial hit , it is a winner all the way , as from a budget of just under $1 million, the film went on to gross ten times its production costs in its initial release. And winning eight Academy Awards , including : Best Picture , Direction (Elia Kazan) , Actor (Marlon Brando), special mention for Eva Maria Saint who gave a debut performance that won her the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award, Cinematography (cameraman Boris Kaufman) , Art Director (Richard Day) . The motion picturre was compellingly directed by Elia Kazan , and it seems to be a direct response to Miller's play The Crucible. In fact , Kazan intended it as a direct attack at his former close friend Arthur Miller who had been openly critical of Elia's actions . Rating : Very good , above average , and a real must see . Well worth watching .",powerful portrait n y docks being stunningly performed excellently directed by elia kazan,this compelling dynamic drama is set new yorks dock where mobsters control union stevedores ex prize fighter named terry malloy marlon brando who deservedly won academy award turned longshoreman struggles stand up his corrupt union bosses lee j cobb is embroiled violence malloy faces terrible dilemma whether or not turn informer while his brother it was originally offered lawrence tierney but he asked too much money so role went rod steiger who was nominated academy award his performance is crooked lawyer he meets beautiful ex nun eva maria saint grace kelly turned down role edie doyle deciding make rear window instead falls love her this is interesting thought provoking film with attractive plot by screenwriter budd schulberg containing intense drama with pungent lines emotion wonderful performances memorable climax magnificent direction classic musical score by maestro leonard berstein this brooding film highy charged throughout story writer budd schulberg took idea newspapers as he started with expose series written new york sun by reporter malcolm johnson articles won him pulitzer prize were reinforced by 1948 murder new york dock hiring boss which woke america killings graft extortion that were endemic new york waterfront marvelous acting by entire casting marlon brando is perfect as stevedore who faces thorny dilemma whether or not become himself into unfortunate informer taxicab scene one most known scenes cinema which brando began improvise some dialogue while surprising rod steiger listened kazan simply stood back let two actors direct themselves along with first rate main cast brando steiger eva maria saint appearing here there great secondaries giving nice interpretations such as lee j cobb leif erickson michel v gazzo pat henning james westerfield martin balsam pat hingle nehemiah persoff among others being film debuts michael v gazzo pat hingle martin balsam eva marie saint leading characters were based real people terry malloy was based longshoreman whistle blower anthony de vincenzo father barry was based waterfront priest john m corridan johnny friendly was based mobster albert anastasia waterfront is widely known be act expiation part elia kazan naming names house committee un american activities huac during joseph mccarthy witch hunts 1950s this trend setting film has gritty portrait n y waterfront stand up well nowadays resulted be huge financial hit it is winner all way as budget just under 1 million film went gross ten times its production costs its initial release winning eight academy awards including best picture direction elia kazan actor marlon brando special mention eva maria saint who gave debut performance that won her best supporting actress academy award cinematography cameraman boris kaufman art director richard day motion picturre was compellingly directed by elia kazan it seems be direct response millers play crucible fact kazan intended it as direct attack at his former close friend arthur miller who had been openly critical elias actions rating very good above average real must see well worth watching,0.5137021867021866,0.26831346431346437,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,"Kazan's film constitutes an extraordinary tour de force of fluid direction and nervous, edgy acting","""On the Waterfront"" is basically the story of one man, Terry Malloy, a young dock worker with a little, and unsuccessful, experience as a boxer but not much intelligence or purpose He wastes his time around the docks, vaguely discontented about his life and revealing a tender trace in his otherwise tough manner as he tends his pigeons caged on the roof of his modest building His brother Charley (Rod Steiger), a suave opportunistic lawyer, works for the local dockers' union, headed by Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), the arrogant mob boss Friendly takes affectionate interest in Terry and tries to make things easy for him He also takes advantage of Terry by involving him in the killing of an uncooperative docker Unaware of their murderous intentions, Terry sets the trap for the man who is thrown from a roof top because he allowed himself to be interviewed by a crime investigating commissionTerry's alienation from the crooked union leaders starts when he meets the dead man's sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint), and realizes the grief he has brought into her life She asks his help in bringing the racketeers to justice, as does Father Barry (Karl Malden), a priest of complete goodness and rightness Brando's moral dilemma was superbly drawn in the film He's an ordinary man finding the courage to stand up and be counted As portrayed by Brando he is touchingly believable The rest of the cast is excellent:Cobb is extremely good as the brute fury boss who intimidates the workers into silence, stopping at nothing to maintain his position of power on the docks... Rod Steiger gives his finest performance as the clever and suave opportunistic lawyer who works for the local docker's union...Eva Marie Saint manages to make the blood go through Brando's valves reviving and creating a heart that never existed before... Karl Malden is hard and clear as the activist Catholic priest who continue encouraging other longshoremen to testify, inciting Brando to fight for his rightsregardless of the costrather than be a pawn in a ruthless system of bribes and killings... ""On the Waterfront"" is one of the great American films, not only because it bravely spreads a strong light on the violation of justice, but because it is a powerful piece of cinema, which push forward a classic study of man's responsibility to his fellow man... The film won eight Academy Awards...",kazans film constitutes extraordinary tour de force fluid direction nervous edgy acting,waterfront is basically story one man terry malloy young dock worker with little unsuccessful experience as boxer but not much intelligence or purpose he wastes his time around docks vaguely discontented about his life revealing tender trace his otherwise tough manner as he tends his pigeons caged roof his modest building his brother charley rod steiger suave opportunistic lawyer works local dockers union headed by johnny friendly lee j cobb arrogant mob boss friendly takes affectionate interest terry tries make things easy him he also takes advantage terry by involving him killing uncooperative docker unaware their murderous intentions terry sets trap man who is thrown roof top because he allowed himself be interviewed by crime investigating commission terrys alienation crooked union leaders starts when he meets dead mans sister edie eva marie saint realizes grief he has brought into her life she asks his help bringing racketeers justice as does father barry karl malden priest complete goodness rightness brandos moral dilemma was superbly drawn film hes ordinary man finding courage stand up be counted as portrayed by brando he is touchingly believable rest cast is excellent cobb is extremely good as brute fury boss who intimidates workers into silence stopping at nothing maintain his position power docks rod steiger gives his finest performance as clever suave opportunistic lawyer who works local dockers union eva marie saint manages make blood go through brandos valves reviving creating heart that never existed before karl malden is hard clear as activist catholic priest who continue encouraging other longshoremen testify inciting brando fight his rights regardless cost rather than be pawn ruthless system bribes killings waterfront is one great american films not only because it bravely spreads strong light violation justice but because it is powerful piece cinema which push forward classic study mans responsibility his fellow man film won eight academy awards,0.5104651162790699,0.09861111111111112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,A classic for all the right reasons,"Watching On The Waterfront nowadays, two scenes stand out head and shoulders above the rest. First is the impassioned speech by Father Barry (Karl Malden) to the gathered dock workers in the hull of a ship where he tries to rally them against the mobsters running their lives. Second is the confrontation between Terry and Charlie Malloy (Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger) in the back of a taxi which ends in one brother pointing a gun at the other and Brando's now legendary ""contender speech."" Both of them are sequences where the characters do nothing but talk but each is a fine example of what makes On The Waterfront the undeniable classic it is; acting, scripting, cinematography, music, everything fits into one cohesive whole and the end result is a welcome addition to any film collection.The story here concerns Terry Malloy, a New York shipyard worker who finds his conscience bothering him when one of his friends is murdered. Terry at first is a tough guy with a grim outlook (""you know my philosophy on life, give it to 'em before they give to you"") who despite his inner turmoil refuses to confess anything to the Police as it would make him a ""rat."" However, the arrival of Malden's headstrong Preacher and the victim's innocent sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint in her debut appearance) throws his deaf and dumb world into chaos. Soon, Terry finds himself falling for Edie and the Preacher's words hit home, leaving the angry young dockworker to question what's really right. The mob meanwhile aren't too happy about Terry's UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP and begin to pile on the pressure, especially his older brother Charlie who's torn between loyalty to his boss and looking out for his younger sibling. Before anyone can put a lid on things, the dockyard becomes a very tense place to be.Brando of course puts his heart and soul into his performance. Terry by his very nature isn't one to carry his heart on his sleeve and so the great Method Actor is left to convey his turmoil through body language alone. It is a testament to how good he is that you can tell exactly what Terry is feeling even though he hardly ever expresses it verbally. Instead his shoulders hunch with resigned indignation and his eyes spark with anger, Brando playing the part so well he more or less disappears into the character completely. While he may have taken a lot of the credit however, he is far from the only strong presence in the film as Karl Malden's rock hard Preacher is just as compelling, his depiction of the dignified man of Christ who isn't afraid to drink beer and smoke cigarettes with the Wharf rats being a refreshingly positive portrayal of a Catholic leader. Eva Marie Saint meanwhile puts in a convincing portrayal of Edie, but she is hamstrung a little by some old fashioned writing. Her pursuit of her brother's murderers give her some powerful moments but there are a couple of instances where it becomes all too clear that the part was written by a man. However, she still gives us one of the most touching moments in the film, a confrontation with Terry where most of their chat is disrupted by a tug horn that is achingly sad despite the absence of dialogue.Acting is only one half of the equation of course and needless to say, the story remains constantly gripping. The murder that opens the film leaves an instant grip on the viewer's attention and as Terry spirals further into an intricate web of half truths, things get incredibly dark. The New York tenement blocks that tower over the proceedings provide an imposing sense of claustrophobia while the rooftops are a smoke laden jungle of chimney stacks and TV aerials. However, if you look closely it becomes apparent that the crew still had some fun with the material and there is some subtle humour to be had - a wedding party degenerating into a brawl and a bar full of panicked customers emptying into the streets followed by a shot of one isolated individual desperately jumping into the bathroom.All in all therefore, On The Waterfront is a film that is thoroughly deserving of its reputation. Brando excels in his role and heads up a highly talented cast giving it their all. Most of all though, it's an engaging and captivating story of urban paranoia, filled with tough guys spitting out slang in barking New York accents. Think you're a big shot, do ya? Huh? Well do us all a favour and check this one out.

,A Few Side Remarks on a Consensus Classic,"No need to echo consensus points, except to say the movie is indeed a powerhouse. Instead, I'll offer a few side comments. The production took place during the McCarthy era. Thus, I expect the catalytic role of Father Barry is no accident, appealing, as it does, to the aggressive anti- communist sentiments of the period. Apparently, initial preferences were to make the union gangsters communists instead of real gangsters. For various reasons, the communist idea was shot down and we get Johnnie Friendly, instead. Still, the religious message is spread on pretty thick by a forcefully effective Karl Malden as the working class Father.In this same political vein, Director Kazan was never forgiven by large segments of the Hollywood left for naming names before the HUAC sub-committee on communist influence in the US. Apparently, he looked upon this movie as a defense of his role before the committee. After all, it's Terry's (Brando) willingness to testify about underworld control of the union that breaks their hold. But, of course, the movie couldn't end on a bland courtroom proceeding, so we get the powerful showdown on the docks, where Terry undergoes a purifying beating for his earlier collaboration with Friendly.It's hard to say enough about the effectiveness of the decision to film on actual dockside in New Jersey. The uncompromising nature of that filming lends necessary grit to an explosive drama. Note too the ongoing sounds of the waterfront that keep reminding us.Maybe I missed something, but I can't understand why the mob killed Charley (Steiger) instead of Terry once they knew Terry would inform. After all, what's going to motivate a guy to retaliate more than killing his brother. Charlie's dangling corpse does make for a powerful scene, as does Terry and Edie's expressionist flight down the shadowy alleyway. But the choice to kill Charlie still seems murky to me.Anyway, these are a few side remarks on a much reviewed film that remains an undiminished classic, even after 60-years.",few side remarks consensus classic,no need echo consensus points except say movie is indeed powerhouse instead ill offer few side comments production took place during mccarthy era thus i expect catalytic role father barry is no accident appealing as it does aggressive anti communist sentiments period apparently initial preferences were make union gangsters communists instead real gangsters various reasons communist idea was shot down we get johnnie friendly instead still religious message is spread pretty thick by forcefully effective karl malden as working class father this same political vein director kazan was never forgiven by large segments hollywood left naming names before huac sub committee communist influence us apparently he looked upon this movie as defense his role before committee after all its terrys brando willingness testify about underworld control union that breaks their hold but course movie couldnt end bland courtroom proceeding so we get powerful showdown docks where terry undergoes purifying beating his earlier collaboration with friendly its hard say enough about effectiveness decision film actual dockside new jersey uncompromising nature that filming lends necessary grit explosive drama note too ongoing sounds waterfront that keep reminding us maybe i missed something but i cant understand why mob killed charley steiger instead terry once they knew terry would inform after all whats going motivate guy retaliate more than killing his brother charlies dangling corpse does make powerful scene as does terry edies expressionist flight down shadowy alleyway but choice kill charlie still seems murky me anyway these are few side remarks much reviewed film that remains undiminished classic even after 60 years,0.4191207998350855,0.056129663986806834,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Magnificent statement about the power of one,"""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing."" (Edmund Burke) The evil in 1954's ""On the Waterfront"" is the union bosses, brilliantly portrayed by Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger and their thugs. They are allowed to do business because of the fright, intimidation, and passiveness of an entire group of longshoremen, who either work or don't while the big shots take kickbacks and steal from them. Then Joey Doyle, who had agreed to testify against the union bosses, is set up by a clueless Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) and thrown off of a roof. His sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint) is determined to find out what happened. But no one will talk. She shames Father Barry (Karl Malden) into taking more of an interest in what is happening on the docks, and he does. Still, no one's talking. Terry falls in love with Edie but still can't do the right thing. Another man is killed. When the killing finally affects Terry, he realizes something has to change.""On the Waterfront"" is one of the most amazing films ever made, directed by the great Elia Kazan. There were three Oscar nominations (Malden, Cobb and Steiger) in the Best Supporting Actor category, and the film took home the top acting awards, Kazan as director, and best film, best screenplay, best editing, best cinematography, best art direction. There was a nomination for Leonard Bernstein's fantastic score, and it's difficult to understand how he could have lost the award. This is the only film for which he wrote incidental music. It is fantastic, particularly in the tender moments between Terry and Edie.""On the Waterfront"" has the classic performance of Marlon Brando, a man who is loyal to his brother Charlie (Steiger) even though Charlie ruined Terry's fight career and now is part of the union corruption. Brando is sensational as a tortured young man (based on whistle-blower Anthony DiVincenzo) who knows what he should do, but the price is too high. It's his love of Edie that gives him a conscience. She's from another world and hasn't been jaded by life yet. It's impossible to believe that this role was offered to Grace Kelly, but it was. Why Kazan thought her cold beauty and finishing school accent would have fit into this scenario is beyond me. Saint is perfect - warm, strong, gentle and most importantly, comes off as the kind of girl who lives in a blue collar neighborhood.Lee J. Cobb as Johnny Friendly (based on real-life mobster Albert Anastasia) gives a bombastic, violent, and scary performance; Karl Malden is letter-perfect as the priest who fights for Terry's soul; and Steiger is excellent as Charlie, a weak man who has taken advantage of his brother to feather his own nest. Karl Malden's character of Father Barry was based on the real-life ""waterfront priest,"" Father John M. Corridan, who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the west side of Manhattan. Father Corridan was interviewed by screenwriter Budd Schulberg.The saddest thing in the film is the attitude of the young boy who helps Terry take care of Joey's pigeons. He's already been inculcated with the ""D&D"" (deaf and dumb) policy of the longshoremen.The cloudy, rich atmosphere of the story is captured by the Hoboken, New Jersey locations - although this is a fictionalized version of events on the New York waterfront.The end of ""Raging Bull"" is a homage to ""On the Waterfront."" The end of ""On the Waterfront"" will give you goosebumps.Evil only triumphs when good men do nothing. When those same men stand up for what they believe in, they show evil for what it really is - cheap, lousy, and dirty.",magnificent statement about power one,all that is necessary triumph evil is that good men do nothing edmund burke evil 1954s waterfront is union bosses brilliantly portrayed by lee j cobb rod steiger their thugs they are allowed do business because fright intimidation passiveness entire group longshoremen who either work or dont while big shots take kickbacks steal them then joey doyle who had agreed testify against union bosses is set up by clueless terry malloy marlon brando thrown off roof his sister edie eva marie saint is determined find out what happened but no one will talk she shames father barry karl malden into taking more interest what is happening docks he does still no ones talking terry falls love with edie but still cant do right thing another man is killed when killing finally affects terry he realizes something has change waterfront is one most amazing films ever made directed by great elia kazan there were three oscar nominations malden cobb steiger best supporting actor category film took home top acting awards kazan as director best film best screenplay best editing best cinematography best art direction there was nomination leonard bernsteins fantastic score its difficult understand how he could have lost award this is only film which he wrote incidental music it is fantastic particularly tender moments between terry edie waterfront has classic performance marlon brando man who is loyal his brother charlie steiger even though charlie ruined terrys fight career now is part union corruption brando is sensational as tortured young man based whistle blower anthony divincenzo who knows what he should do but price is too high its his love edie that gives him conscience shes another world hasnt been jaded by life yet its impossible believe that this role was offered grace kelly but it was why kazan thought her cold beauty finishing school accent would have fit into this scenario is beyond me saint is perfect warm strong gentle most importantly comes off as kind girl who lives blue collar neighborhood lee j cobb as johnny friendly based real life mobster albert anastasia gives bombastic violent scary performance karl malden is letter perfect as priest who fights terrys soul steiger is excellent as charlie weak man who has taken advantage his brother feather his own nest karl maldens character father barry was based real life waterfront priest father john m corridan who operated roman catholic labor school west side manhattan father corridan was interviewed by screenwriter budd schulberg saddest thing film is attitude young boy who helps terry take care joeys pigeons hes already been inculcated with d d deaf dumb policy longshoremen cloudy rich atmosphere story is captured by hoboken new jersey locations although this is fictionalized version events new york waterfront end raging bull is homage waterfront end waterfront will give you goosebumps evil only triumphs when good men do nothing when those same men stand up what they believe they show evil what it really is cheap lousy dirty,0.6306162646876933,0.223834879406308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,Not what I expected- so much more.,"IMDb Top 250: 105I finished On the Waterfront about 2 hours ago, and something strange happened. Something I haven't done in a long while, I can't for certain remember the film that caused it. When the film ended, I sat in silence for about 10 minutes.On the Waterfront is an inspiring film. There's a feeling you get watching it- movie magic. Something great is playing out in front of your eyes and you are taking in the collective effort of geniuses. Right from the start, with the dramatic score (that stays fine throughout) introducing the film, something special is happening.The plot synopsis gives the appearance of a plain film, and plain it is not. The mob, murder and romance are the stars of this show and right off the start this is apparent- like the lighting of a fuse. Then as the wick burns down, the drama unfolds. We learn about Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), his past and present, and his conflicted thoughts. We are introduced to characters that push him down the path he has to choose. A viewer grows to care about Terry, and until he decides for himself, we have no idea what he'll do.This film is an acting gold magnet- it received 5 nominations in acting alone. I'll start with Brando's legendary performance. It doesn't matter what you think of him offscreen because for 2 hours he is at his very best, one of the best in acting ever. Terry is a fantastic character and Brando gives an unrivalled, honest performance.Wanting him to stand against his negative influences are Father Barry (Karl Malden) and Edie (Eva Marie Saint). The father is a frustrated man, furious in his quest for righteousness. Only in The Exorcist have I liked a priest as much. He gives a raging performance, at its peak with a scolding of the longshoremen. Riveting. With him, but quite the opposite in character is Edie, who falls into the plot. Saint aces her characters role, which is to mold Terry. Their scenes are tender, believable, and in a recurring theme with the film, honest. During their bar scene I thought they could've just made a romance together, leaving out all the drama.On the other side, the mob union leaders, we have Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), the head honcho, who is ferocious, intimidating, and impeccably evil to honest workers. There's also Charley (Rod Steiger), Terry's older brother who is comfortably in with the mob. I didn't notice him at all, except for 'the scene' which must've made him in the Academy's eyes.Speaking of 'the scene', the pivotal Taxi cab dialogue between Terry and Charley, you can tell as it happens this is the moment, the peak of On the Waterfront and Marlon Brando. It is the turning point of the film, where Terry makes some huge realizations that we can infer from only his face and tone. I won't even discuss his words, as it's been done by absolutely everyone. There are several other great scenes, like the 'It's a crucifixion' speech and the various rooftop scenes.Right until the last scene we aren't sure what will happen. I won't spoil it, but it's elevating. Heroic. Even enlightening.On the Waterfront is about the small speaking out against the large and corrupt. It's about going against the flow, breaking the silence. Sometime in your life you were or will be in Terry's position to some degree, and you'll either do or don't. Leave it at that, please don't read the director's reasoning behind the film. Take it for what it is: a fantastic film that will make you want to be a better person who can speak out against wrongdoers. Powerful indeed.I thought On the Waterfront would be good, but not this good. With stupendous performances, a top notch story and a strong message, On the Waterfront is film at it's best. 9.4/10",not what i expected so much more,imdb top 250 105i finished waterfront about 2 hours ago something strange happened something i havent done long while i cant certain remember film that caused it when film ended i sat silence about 10 minutes waterfront is inspiring film theres feeling you get watching it movie magic something great is playing out front your eyes you are taking collective effort geniuses right start with dramatic score that stays fine throughout introducing film something special is happening plot synopsis gives appearance plain film plain it is not mob murder romance are stars this show right off start this is apparent like lighting fuse then as wick burns down drama unfolds we learn about terry malloy marlon brando his past present his conflicted thoughts we are introduced characters that push him down path he has choose viewer grows care about terry until he decides himself we have no idea what hell do this film is acting gold magnet it received 5 nominations acting alone ill start with brandos legendary performance it doesnt matter what you think him offscreen because 2 hours he is at his very best one best acting ever terry is fantastic character brando gives unrivalled honest performance wanting him stand against his negative influences are father barry karl malden edie eva marie saint father is frustrated man furious his quest righteousness only exorcist have i liked priest as much he gives raging performance at its peak with scolding longshoremen riveting with him but quite opposite character is edie who falls into plot saint aces her characters role which is mold terry their scenes are tender believable recurring theme with film honest during their bar scene i thought they couldve just made romance together leaving out all drama other side mob union leaders we have johnny friendly lee j cobb head honcho who is ferocious intimidating impeccably evil honest workers theres also charley rod steiger terrys older brother who is comfortably with mob i didnt notice him at all except scene which mustve made him academys eyes speaking scene pivotal taxi cab dialogue between terry charley you can tell as it happens this is moment peak waterfront marlon brando it is turning point film where terry makes some huge realizations that we can infer only his face tone i wont even discuss his words as its been done by absolutely everyone there are several other great scenes like its crucifixion speech various rooftop scenes right until last scene we arent sure what will happen i wont spoil it but its elevating heroic even enlightening waterfront is about small speaking out against large corrupt its about going against flow breaking silence sometime your life you were or will be terrys position some degree youll either do or dont leave it at that please dont read directors reasoning behind film take it what it is fantastic film that will make you want be better person who can speak out against wrongdoers powerful indeed i thought waterfront would be good but not this good with stupendous performances top notch story strong message waterfront is film at its best 9 4 10,0.5568979591836734,0.21802154195011336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,A film I consider absolutely perfect,"I watched ""On the Waterfront"" last night, and I have seen it many times. This movie is a perfect capsule for any viewer. The actors are superb in their roles, the dialogue is raw and powerful, the staging is tight and reflects the claustrophobic nature of the characters' lives in this part of Hoboken. You have the feeling that they never leave this area of maybe a few blocks, because they feel trapped by their circumstances, poverty, grueling work, and the corruption that's endemic in this place and system.Marlon Brando is Terry, a failed prize fighter with deep regrets and loneliness, who is a low-level thug in this corrupt system dominated by the bombastic, cruel union boss, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb in an electrifying performance). He rules the waterfront with brutality and terror. To make Terry feel even more trapped is the fact that his only living relative, his brother, Charlie (Rod Steiger), is Friendly's right-hand man. Terry has no great ambitions in life, and seems resigned to this bleak path until fate, and two shining lights, appear in his life: Edie (Eva Marie Saint), a decent, loving, determined and angelic blonde woman, and Father Barry (Karl Malden), the local priest who can throw a punch, drink a beer and stand up to the mob with the strength of his faith behind him. Terry and Edie embark on a seemingly doomed romance that both actors play so beautifully. You can feel their yearning, their awkwardness, their passion for each other and their deep connection -- all without the explicit nudity and fake grunting used in contemporary movies. When they embrace, you feel their desperation and desire for each other in a profound way.""On the Waterfront"" is certainly director Elia Kazan's great masterpiece. The performances are all outstanding, and Brando is just a marvel of tortured pain and passion and agony and courage. One particular thing I love about ""On the Waterfront"" is the scenery. Every set or outdoor shot conveys the grim, cold nature of the characters' lives. There is no movie glamour and little comfort here. Only a hot cup of coffee made on a plug-in heating plate in a ""cold-water flat,"" or a beer and a shot hastily consumed in a waterfront saloon are pleasures to these characters. Their clothes are patched. Edie's hair isn't ""styled,"" and she wears no makeup. Terry's face is a bit scarred. Malden's nose is...as we all know. The gritty setting feels real.

10.0,Still Packs A Wallop,"Still powerful after all these years, it's easy to see why this film won so many awards. Even though it isn't classified as ""film noir,"" it might as well be, as it has the earmarks of one: gritty, downbeat with a feeling of dread, magnificent black-and-white cinematography, etc.It's certainly not a ""fun"" movie but if you appreciate great film-making, you have to rate this near the top of the list Not only is the direction (by one of the all-time greats, Elia Kazan) superb and the photography striking, the acting also is top-rate.Marlon Brando was just riveting to watch in here and deserved all the accolades he received for his performance. Talk about a guy with mixed emotions and a tormented soul! Eva Marie Saint, as Brando's ""conscience"" and love interest, proved to be worthy in her role.The rest of the characters were angry people, always shouting it seemed, always upset at someone. Even the priest, played by Karl Malden, was that way although one of his passionate speeches was remarkable to hear. How many films does one hear about Jesus Christ being everywhere men are? None I can recall, offhand. He, like Saint's character, also influenced Brando to do the right thing.Lee J. Cobb filled his bill as the angriest of them all, the labor boss who would have anyone killed who dare speak out against his illegal practices, and Rod Steiger was his normal intense self as Brando's older brother. Hey, almost everyone was intense in this film. It gets you involves and wears you out by the end.Steiger and Brando's conversation in an automobile fairly late in the film (""I couda been a contenda"") is one of the most famous scenes in movie history, but I found many memorable scenes in this movie....too many to recount here.Suffice to say if you are looking for a hard-nosed drama with great acting and photography, a film that still looks and sounds up-to-date in many respects, don't be afraid to give this ""oldie"" a look.

7.0,Excellent performances; so-so story,"Elia Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" is frequently listed among the greatest of all American films. It concerns a longshoreman's inner and outer struggles in exposing the corruption of union bosses.Unquestionably, the strength of the film is the acting. Brando's performance in particular is one for the ages. He won his first Oscar for this role and Eva Marie Saint also garnered an Oscar in her introductory film role. On top of that Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb & Rod Steiger all earned Best Supporting Actor nominations. These accolades give an idea of the level of talent on display here.Kazan's direction is well done as he strives for a gritty, realistic look. Shooting on location was an important part of that. Leonard Bernstein's score, on the other hand, is often overbearing. There's nothing wrong with the music itself, only the prominence of it.The main area in which I feel the film doesn't quite deliver is the story. The film does a fine job of exploring the characters but I find that the underlying storyline doesn't really work for me. The main premise is a good one but after the initial confrontation I began to lose interest. The self-consciously 'inspiring' ending doesn't help, either.All things considered, I give the film high marks for the excellent acting and direction which, unfortunately, are in service of a merely average story.",excellent performances so so story,elia kazans waterfront is frequently listed among greatest all american films it concerns longshoremans inner outer struggles exposing corruption union bosses unquestionably strength film is acting brandos performance particular is one ages he won his first oscar this role eva marie saint also garnered oscar her introductory film role top that karl malden lee j cobb rod steiger all earned best supporting actor nominations these accolades give idea level talent display here kazans direction is well done as he strives gritty realistic look shooting location was important part that leonard bernsteins score other hand is often overbearing theres nothing wrong with music itself only prominence it main area which i feel film doesnt quite deliver is story film does fine job exploring characters but i find that underlying storyline doesnt really work me main premise is good one but after initial confrontation i began lose interest self consciously inspiring ending doesnt help either all things considered i give film high marks excellent acting direction which unfortunately are service merely average story,0.49821839080459773,0.23683908045977017,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Quite simply a classic,"Gripping, powerful drama of corrupt unions for dock workers and how one man Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) fights back.This movie is a definite must-see. The story is pretty simple and has been done before but the script is superb and all the actors are at the height of their powers. Brando is unbelievable as Malloy--he portrays his innocence and hurt so easily--I actually started to get a lump in my throat when he comes to grips about the corruption. Rod Steiger is great in a small role as his brother. The taxicab sequence between him and Brando has become a legend--rightfully. Lee J. Cobb is frightening as the leader of it all. Eva Marie Saint (in her first theatrical role) is gorgeous and just great as a woman who falls in love with Brando. The scenes between them are incredible. There's also superb direction by Elia Kazan--this is possibly his best work. The only debit here is Karl Malden as the priest--he overplays it way too much and got on more nerves.

10.0,My extended review of the film,"My comments here are written in light of having watching the film for a second time. While I liked 'On the Waterfront' a lot the first time round, I appreciated it even more the second time. There are some slight negative points - the music is at times overbearing and the religious side it tries to bring forth does not quite work - but there is not anything significant that I would flaw the film on.The acting is definitely the film's strongest point. Marlon Brando gives and intense and realistic performance. It is not just because of the famous car scene, or the well-known scene in the bar with Saint, that makes his performance great. It is everything that he does throughout, in particular the facial expressions that he captures on his face. Towards the end there is a scene in which he stands alone and just stares at his fellow workers. His expression is unflinching without being unrealistic. Eva Marie Saint is quite good too, also giving off a performance in which her face is central. However, there is less to talk about with her than there is about the supporting actors.When I first viewed the film, it was Karl Malden's acting that stood out the most to me. His performance and character are powerful, however on a second viewing it seems a bit over-the-top, as does the whole religious side of the film in which he is involved. On the other hand, Lee J. Cobb is brilliant as Johnny Friendly, providing a fierce performance while not letting his character turn into a stereotype of evil. Then there is Rod Steiger, whose acting, after only one viewing of the film, I did not take much notice of. He is hardly there, and until the point when he instructed to talk with Brando, he does not have much to do. Indeed, Rod Steiger has very few good scenes in the film, however he is excellent in those scenes. It is incredibly realistic acting, the way he interacts with his brother, and the way he is torn between the mob and his family.The next thing to mention is that this film could never be as effective in colour. The bleakness of the black and white prints is used well by Kazan. There are many shots of the characters, which just show their heads against a white sky: a bleak white sky. We cannot even see if it is cloudy or sunny day. The sky is as plain and as barren as what the future holds for each of the characters. Leonard Bernstein's music deserves a mention too. It is an electrifying score and often fits the actions very well. It is at times a tad overbearing (note the scene where Brando goes to Saint's house) as it has a tendency to over-ride the dialogue and the action. However, this does not subtract much from the overall picture.The sound recording is very realistic. The dock noises can often be heard, which helps to set up the waterfront atmosphere, and there is one scene in which the noise of a ship plays a key element in a conversation between Saint and Brando. In that conversation it is metaphoric, and it could even be argued that it is only heard through perceptual subjectivity. The other noises are sharply recorded too, such as banging at the basement of the church. The photography is excellent, using shadows very well to set up the atmosphere, all of which is captured well with some glides and tilts.One can praise a film for many different reasons, but it is not worth much unless one can explain what the film is about. I would say that 'On the Waterfront' is a drama about struggling against the restrictions of society, and of what it takes to stand up for what one believes in. However, I also see it as an exciting thriller about fighting corruption and the harshness of stevedore life in a community that is effectively run by gangsters. Perhaps it is about love and how relationships develop, and the events that help them to grow strong. I think different viewers will take some different out of it. And it is perhaps that, more than the artistic and cinematic qualities of the film, which makes it a great piece of cinema.",my extended review film,my comments here are written light having watching film second time while i liked waterfront lot first time round i appreciated it even more second time there are some slight negative points music is at times overbearing religious side it tries bring forth does not quite work but there is not anything significant that i would flaw film acting is definitely films strongest point marlon brando gives intense realistic performance it is not just because famous car scene or well known scene bar with saint that makes his performance great it is everything that he does throughout particular facial expressions that he captures his face towards end there is scene which he stands alone just stares at his fellow workers his expression is unflinching without being unrealistic eva marie saint is quite good too also giving off performance which her face is central however there is less talk about with her than there is about supporting actors when i first viewed film it was karl maldens acting that stood out most me his performance character are powerful however second viewing it seems bit over top as does whole religious side film which he is involved other hand lee j cobb is brilliant as johnny friendly providing fierce performance while not letting his character turn into stereotype evil then there is rod steiger whose acting after only one viewing film i did not take much notice he is hardly there until point when he instructed talk with brando he does not have much do indeed rod steiger has very few good scenes film however he is excellent those scenes it is incredibly realistic acting way he interacts with his brother way he is torn between mob his family next thing mention is that this film could never be as effective colour bleakness black white prints is used well by kazan there are many shots characters which just show their heads against white sky bleak white sky we cannot even see if it is cloudy or sunny day sky is as plain as barren as what future holds each characters leonard bernsteins music deserves mention too it is electrifying score often fits actions very well it is at times tad overbearing note scene where brando goes saints house as it has tendency over ride dialogue action however this does not subtract much overall picture sound recording is very realistic dock noises can often be heard which helps set up waterfront atmosphere there is one scene which noise ship plays key element conversation between saint brando that conversation it is metaphoric it could even be argued that it is only heard through perceptual subjectivity other noises are sharply recorded too such as banging at basement church photography is excellent using shadows very well set up atmosphere all which is captured well with some glides tilts one can praise film many different reasons but it is not worth much unless one can explain what film is about i would say that waterfront is drama about struggling against restrictions society what it takes stand up what one believes however i also see it as exciting thriller about fighting corruption harshness stevedore life community that is effectively run by gangsters perhaps it is about love how relationships develop events that help them grow strong i think different viewers will take some different out it it is perhaps that more than artistic cinematic qualities film which makes it great piece cinema,0.4551048752834468,0.15348072562358275,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Powerful every time I see it,"Back in the early 1950's, after a movie had run its course at the theaters, it did not go to video. Nor did it go on prime-time TV, as that concept came up many years later. Instead, they put it on afternoon TV, sometimes around dinner time. Well, that's when I'd come home from high school, and got to enjoy free black and white classics such as ""High Noon"" and ""On the Waterfront"".It made a moviefan of me for life. I remember the effect of ""On the Waterfront"", as I remember thinking about Terry Malloy in that final scene, ""Wow, that guy's got guts! I wish I could be like him."" Being just a typical Midwestern teen, I didn't know who Marlon Brando was, but I just was fascinated by this life of these good and bad people, on the tops of buildings and in the cold, wet streets and alleys of this far-away place near the waterfront.Now, every time I watch it, years later, I still love it. Yes, there is definitely an attempt to make Terry into a Christ-figure at the end. That's no coincidence that he stumbles from having been beaten to a pulp, to walk and carry a hook on his shoulders, to lead others to a better life. (In the book by Budd Schulberg, by the way, Terry disappears after testifying and what is thought to be his body is found floating in a barrel of lime. But he has become a legend on the waterfront.) I love the powerful Elmer Bernstein score (glaring for our present tastes, but back then, exactly what people expected to hear during a drama -- you've got to wonder what a future generation will say about the constant replays of fairly irrelevant pop and rap songs as themes during most movies today, dramatic or comedy). And being raised in a Catholic home, I found Father Barry to be a great dramatic figure, one of the only times I saw a priest portrayed as a gritty, brave, heroic person, not afraid to mix it up with the common folks in the parish. He smoked, drank and slugged it out. And he was not afraid to die for the right reason. Folks, that's true Christianity at work. And that's powerful.A classic. A must-see. 10/10",powerful every time i see it,back early 1950s after movie had run its course at theaters it did not go video nor did it go prime time tv as that concept came up many years later instead they put it afternoon tv sometimes around dinner time well thats when id come home high school got enjoy free black white classics such as high noon waterfront it made moviefan me life i remember effect waterfront as i remember thinking about terry malloy that final scene wow that guys got guts i wish i could be like him being just typical midwestern teen i didnt know who marlon brando was but i just was fascinated by this life these good bad people tops buildings cold wet streets alleys this far away place near waterfront now every time i watch it years later i still love it yes there is definitely attempt make terry into christ figure at end thats no coincidence that he stumbles having been beaten pulp walk carry hook his shoulders lead others better life book by budd schulberg by way terry disappears after testifying what is thought be his body is found floating barrel lime but he has become legend waterfront i love powerful elmer bernstein score glaring our present tastes but back then exactly what people expected hear during drama youve got wonder what future generation will say about constant replays fairly irrelevant pop rap songs as themes during most movies today dramatic or comedy being raised catholic home i found father barry be great dramatic figure one only times i saw priest portrayed as gritty brave heroic person not afraid mix it up with common folks parish he smoked drank slugged it out he was not afraid die right reason folks thats true christianity at work thats powerful classic must see 10 10,0.5458963585434173,0.11906629318394024,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
6.0,A sense of dislocation,"I queued for twenty minutes in a crowded cinema to get into this film, and was lucky to have even a sidelong seat... yet I was left in the end feeling disappointed. The only people on the IMDb who fail to worship ""On the Waterfront"" appear to be those who hate its director - on 'ethical' grounds. Well, I care little enough about Elia Kazan's history or politics, yet all the same somehow I wasn't sufficiently impressed. The film features all the technical skill of Hollywood's Golden Age, supporting actors and establishing shots and, yes, innovative use of music; in many ways I'd rate it 8 out of 10. But the best film ever - the greatest star performance? That I honestly can't see, and I admit that the high expectations hurt my reaction to the result. But thinking back, I find the chief causes of my vague dissatisfaction to be twofold: Marlon Brando, and the too-convenient outcomes of the plot.Brando I suppose I just don't 'get' - I saw him in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""One-Eyed Jacks"", and missed whatever-it-was I was supposed to spot then. Where I'm concerned he holds if anything a sort of physical anti-charisma - the slouch, the mumble - and the acting that supposedly makes his contemporaries look like posturing hams, I simply don't see. And so in my ignorance, not knowing that this was held to be one of the greatest performances of the century, I was left with the impression that Marlon Brando was actually the weak link in this film.The revelation that the character is thirty years of age comes as a real shock: he's treated and acts throughout as little more than a sulky teenager. The lack of expression may simply be skillful acting to depict the character's stunted emotional growth, but I'm afraid I found it hard to care much what happened to Brando's Terry Malloy, whereas Rod Steiger, with far briefer screen-time, brought brother Charley and his wrenching choice vividly to life. But there's nothing inherently wrong with the role of Terry, and I can't help feeling that it would have been fascinating to see what some other actor might also have made of it.My other serious problem, unfortunately, was the way that the plot treats our heroes with kid gloves... thus undermining the whole sense of menace on which any ""one man against the Mob"" plot ultimately relies. Yes, the script is happy enough to bump off a minor character or two in order to emphasise the threat of Friendly's organisation, and yes, Terry does finally get beaten up. But compared to the summary justice administered to Joey Doyle or Dugan for far lighter offences, a punch-up seems pretty easy going - Terry's lucky not to fall victim to another 'accident'.But the fact remains that up until then, our heroes have got away with open defiance. As far as the Production Code goes, Edie is evidently sacrosanct by virtue of her sex and the priest by virtue of his cloth (despite Dugan's portentous warnings, the worst the Father gets seems to be a rotten tomato). Brando is, one can only assume, preserved by being The Hero.A highly dramatic assassination attempt amounts to no more than driving a lorry at him in the street, with no attempt to finish the job as he takes the bait and hangs around Charley's body to emote. He walks into his enemies' headquarters with no more protection than a single unaccustomed gun, and no-one even attempts to lay a finger on him... even after his own ally, equally unscathed, knocks him down! The worst repercussion he seems to face, for all the trumpeted bravery of his betrayal, is a petulant ""you'll never work in this town again"" - and even this is undermined by a convenient unheralded change of heart on the part of the workers who have never previously cared for him: the 'bum' who gets all the cushy jobs and now the traitor who broke the code of the docks, yet losing a fight suddenly makes him some kind of holy hero. I'm left with that feeling of manipulation: things happening or failing to happen because they meet the desired message, not because they further the emotional value of the plot.Some aspects of the script are very well done, but I found myself with the jarring conviction that I'd just watched a film noir - and a good one, with all the skills and devices of the genre - with a tacked-on happy ending. In a great film, the plot should seem ordained, interlocking, inevitable. Here, I got the impression that the screenplay was more interested in showcasing big scenes for its star, and in an arbitrary moral, however obtained - maybe politics does come into it after all...In many ways, the film is good; it's worth having seen. But I cannot truthfully say that I would recommend it whole-heartedly to a friend, let alone recommend him to put himself to trouble or expense to see it, as I did. That makes for a rating of 6/10. Without Brando, for my part, it would probably have been a seven.(Edit: I was fascinated to discover by chance today that the uneasy strain between the basic story set-up and the final outcome is *not* in my imagination alone: it's the direct result of warring visions between writer and director. The character of Terry really has been 'sexed up' to provide Brando with a more significant and sympathetic role, and the apotheosis of the informer is all Kazan's idea - in Schulberg's published version, Terry winds up in an unmarked grave and Father Barry is the most important protagonist... It turns out that the dislocation that jarred me so can be traced with almost clinical exactness to this collision of two quite separate concepts of message and plot: frankly, it explains an awful lot!)",sense dislocation,i queued twenty minutes crowded cinema get into this film was lucky have even sidelong seat yet i was left end feeling disappointed only people imdb who fail worship

10.0,One of the most gripping film with a top notch mesmerizing performance by Brando.,"I first saw this in the early 90s. Revisited it recently. I love this masterpiece n Brando's performance is the highlight of the film. While there is no boxing action shown in the film, the film looks very realistic.

10.0,I could have been somebody...,"Elia Kazan's film is still amazing after 50 years. It's curious how it parallels Kazan's own life in the way the main character, Terry Malloy, ends up naming names to the commission investigating the corruption on the waterfront, the same way the director did in front of the HUAC committee, presided by the evil Senator Joe McCarthy and his henchman, Roy Cohn. Bud Schulberg's screen play is his best work for the movies. It also helped that Elia Kazan had a free reign over the film, which otherwise could have gone wrong under someone else's direction.Terry Malloy, as we see him first, is a man without a conscience. He is instrumental in ratting on a fellow longshoreman, who is killed because he knows about the criminal activities on the piers. At the same time, Terry is transformed and ultimately redeems himself because he falls in love with Edie Doyle, the sister of the man that is killed by the mob. Terry Malloy is a complex character. His own brother Charley, is the right hand man of Johnny Friendly, the union boss. Charley is trying to save Terry. It's clear that Charley is going to be sacrificed because of the way he is acting by the same people he works with. In a way, the death of young Doyle is paid back with Charley's own, an interesting twist of events, when it should have been Terry the one that had ratted in the first place.Marlon Brando had his best opportunity here. Everyone lavished praise for his performance. I don't know whether it was me, or what, but the way he played Terry, at times, is an enigma. Could it be the way he speaks? The taxi scene, when he speaks in his famous line, his voice sounds so out of character. Maybe it was Brando's take on the character, but in retrospect, he doesn't sound like a New York wise guy. Eva Marie Saint, whose made her debut in the cinema in this movie, is excellent as the sweet Edie. It's incredible she stays with Terry even though he's been instrumental in the death of her own brother. She is obviously in love with Terry and will do anything for him. Karl Malden's character is also symbolic. He represents the sanity and the salvation for an otherwise horrible person, because Terry up to this point has no conscience and he is resentful for the fact he never got to be somebody when he had a chance in the boxing ring.Lee J. Cobb, one of the great actors of the American movies gives a detailed performance as Johnny Friendly, the boss of the union local that controlled the waterfront. Rod Steiger, as the crooked brother Charley was amazing. There are a lot of minor roles such as Martin Balsam, who went to bigger and better things. Also, a non speaking Fred Gwynne who is part of Friendly's crew.This films owes a great deal to the black and white cinematography of Boris Kaufman and to the great musical score of Leonard Bernstein. Was it me, or was this film an inspiration for the music he later composed for West Side Story?One of the greatest films of all times.",i could have been somebody,elia kazans film is still amazing after 50 years its curious how it parallels kazans own life way main character terry malloy ends up naming names commission investigating corruption waterfront same way director did front huac committee presided by evil senator joe mccarthy his henchman roy cohn bud schulbergs screen play is his best work movies it also helped that elia kazan had free reign over film which otherwise could have gone wrong under someone elses direction terry malloy as we see him first is man without conscience he is instrumental ratting fellow longshoreman who is killed because he knows about criminal activities piers at same time terry is transformed ultimately redeems himself because he falls love with edie doyle sister man that is killed by mob terry malloy is complex character his own brother charley is right hand man johnny friendly union boss charley is trying save terry its clear that charley is going be sacrificed because way he is acting by same people he works with way death young doyle is paid back with charleys own interesting twist events when it should have been terry one that had ratted first place marlon brando had his best opportunity here everyone lavished praise his performance i dont know whether it was me or what but way he played terry at times is enigma could it be way he speaks taxi scene when he speaks his famous line his voice sounds so out character maybe it was brandos take character but retrospect he doesnt sound like new york wise guy eva marie saint whose made her debut cinema this movie is excellent as sweet edie its incredible she stays with terry even though hes been instrumental death her own brother she is obviously love with terry will do anything him karl maldens character is also symbolic he represents sanity salvation otherwise horrible person because terry up this point has no conscience he is resentful fact he never got be somebody when he had chance boxing ring lee j cobb one great actors american movies gives detailed performance as johnny friendly boss union local that controlled waterfront rod steiger as crooked brother charley was amazing there are lot minor roles such as martin balsam who went bigger better things also non speaking fred gwynne who is part friendlys crew this films owes great deal black white cinematography boris kaufman great musical score leonard bernstein was it me or was this film inspiration music he later composed west side story one greatest films all times,0.5259987088934457,0.24161540214171798,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Life Is Pretty Bad In Palookaville,"After three nominations for Best Actor in 1951 for A Streetcar Named Desire, 1952 for Viva Zapata, and 1953 for Julius Caesar, the Oscar was not to be denied Marlon Brando for the fourth time. Although his playing of Terry Malloy was indeed Oscar caliber stuff, the award was really for a most remarkable body of work on screen up to that time. It was also for setting a new trend in acting style and influencing the next three generations of players.On the Waterfront is also alleged to be Elia Kazan's answer to his critics of why he was a namer of names at the House Un-American Activities Committee. I don't think it was an accident that the subject of this film was labor racketeering. Forgotten by a lot of the people who defame Kazan today is that the Communist Party asked him to infiltrate and spy on not just actors, but various craft unions associated with film and theater. It was something he never forget.He's often called a friendly witness. To me a friendly witness is someone who was an unabashed admirer of the House Un-American Activities Committee and its work, someone like Adolphe Menjou or Hedda Hopper or even John Wayne, people who were convinced these people were doing a patriotic service. In On the Waterfront, labor racketeer Lee J. Cobb, a bullying loudmouth of a man, runs the longshoreman's local. He commits murder, extortion, and various other crimes at will without fear of reprisal because no one will talk because of their code against informing. Waterfront priest Karl Malden realizes it, but bangs his head against the code of deaf and dumb.Marlon Brando is a washed up ex-prizefighter who finds work on the docks through his older brother Rod Steiger who works for Cobb. Unknowingly he fingers Eva Marie Saint's brother for a hit and then he falls for her. The film is essentially Brando's struggle to find out what the right thing to do in this situation.When he's on the screen Brando dominates. He invests the character of Terry Malloy with a lot of layers and the audience really struggles with Terry in his soul searching. He starts to see Cobb and to a lesser extent his brother Steiger as more exploitive than helpful even in his own life. That famous taxi scene with Steiger who's got his own life on the line if he doesn't get his brother away from Eva Marie is one where it all comes out. Brando got his ticket to Palookaville and he doesn't like the neighborhood at all.Eva Marie Saint got a Best Supporting Actress in her film debut. She's pretty far from later characters she played like the cool blond of Cary Grant's dreams in North By Northwest. Those were more the roles she played in her career than the working class girl of On the Waterfront.Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, and Rod Steiger all were nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category and they wound up splitting the vote and allowing Edmond O'Brien to win for The Barefoot Contessa. The other nominee was Tom Tully in The Caine Mutiny. All three could have been winners.I remember when Elia Kazan died a few years ago and I think the unkindest cut of all for him was to be eulogized on television by Pat Buchanan. Though the left disowned him, he always considered himself a man of the left. One could fight injustice without submitting to a regimentation of the soul that Communism was when it triumphed. Something a lot don't realize today. The regimentation that Lee J. Cobb had on those longshoremen is what Kazan was expressing himself against in On the Waterfront. over fifty years later it's a landmark expression.",life is pretty bad palookaville,after three nominations best actor 1951 streetcar named desire 1952 viva zapata 1953 julius caesar oscar was not be denied marlon brando fourth time although his playing terry malloy was indeed oscar caliber stuff award was really most remarkable body work screen up that time it was also setting new trend acting style influencing next three generations players waterfront is also alleged be elia kazans answer his critics why he was namer names at house un american activities committee i dont think it was accident that subject this film was labor racketeering forgotten by lot people who defame kazan today is that communist party asked him infiltrate spy not just actors but various craft unions associated with film theater it was something he never forget hes often called friendly witness me friendly witness is someone who was unabashed admirer house un american activities committee its work someone like adolphe menjou or hedda hopper or even john wayne people who were convinced these people were doing patriotic service waterfront labor racketeer lee j cobb bullying loudmouth man runs longshoremans local he commits murder extortion various other crimes at will without fear reprisal because no one will talk because their code against informing waterfront priest karl malden realizes it but bangs his head against code deaf dumb marlon brando is washed up ex prizefighter who finds work docks through his older brother rod steiger who works cobb unknowingly he fingers eva marie saints brother hit then he falls her film is essentially brandos struggle find out what right thing do this situation when hes screen brando dominates he invests character terry malloy with lot layers audience really struggles with terry his soul searching he starts see cobb lesser extent his brother steiger as more exploitive than helpful even his own life that famous taxi scene with steiger whos got his own life line if he doesnt get his brother away eva marie is one where it all comes out brando got his ticket palookaville he doesnt like neighborhood at all eva marie saint got best supporting actress her film debut shes pretty far later characters she played like cool blond cary grants dreams north by northwest those were more roles she played her career than working class girl waterfront karl malden lee j cobb rod steiger all were nominated best supporting actor category they wound up splitting vote allowing edmond obrien win barefoot contessa other nominee was tom tully caine mutiny all three could have been winners i remember when elia kazan died few years ago i think unkindest cut all him was be eulogized television by pat buchanan though left disowned him he always considered himself man left one could fight injustice without submitting regimentation soul that communism was when it triumphed something lot dont realize today regimentation that lee j cobb had those longshoremen is what kazan was expressing himself against waterfront over fifty years later its landmark expression,0.3971271153089335,0.20334268004722553,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"

We are taught to hide feelings, not betray trusts (snitch), and yet how do we help the little guy, the downtrodden if we don't. It's a remarkable film about a man who has to do what he has to do and face beatings and exclusion and a reputation these dock workers would not want. He also has few prospects as the famous taxi scene shows us. It's too bad Brando had so many hang ups but maybe that's what made him great.

For me, Brando has always been the ultimate male. Simply put, bruiting desire. Brando represents the very definition of method acting, even though he was said to have hated the phrase. Being able to reach inside yourself and pull something out that kicks everyone in the ass. He was truly one of a kind. They say sometimes beautiful people are born under a dark cloud.

5.0,The Film School Movie,"Except for Karl Malden who overplays his role as a priest, the acting here is quite good. Rod Steiger, Lee J. Cobb, and Eva Marie Saint all give fine performances. And Brando is indeed terrific as Terry Malloy, the non-intellectual brick-head and former boxer who is torn between his own conscience and loyalty to a corrupt gang of bullies. His scene in the taxi with Steiger is his most famous in the film. But I actually prefer his performance in the bar, wherein he tries to console the sister of the dead man.Apart from the acting, however, I find little of interest. The B&W cinematography, though competent, is nothing special, except for the scene where Malloy and his girl run through an alleyway; that scene is quite effective and a good example of noir lighting. Otherwise, the visuals are drab, cheerless, and dull beyond words. The low contrast lighting of the blue-collar shipyard area conveys a mood of bleakness and misery.Most of the script's characters are humorless hoods and thugs devoid of sentiment or kindness. Everyone is angry, and they're angry through the whole story. There's not an ounce of humor anywhere. Conflict is both verbal and physical. This is a very talky script. Some of the longer scenes could pass for stage play material. I couldn't care less about the political intrigue that was the basis for the original film concept. And the film's background music is loud and overbearing.""On The Waterfront"" is one of several old movies that film school instructors like to use to show examples of high quality acting. Similarly, for a viewer to say he or she likes this movie would be ""safe""; hardly anyone will force him to defend his opinion.But times change. The movie is way outdated.

8.0,"More and more, the Rolled-out Dough will crook the Rolling Pin","Terry lives in the shadow of his smart brother Charley the Gent working for a double-handed businessman of the underworld. He had his best times of his life during his boxing career, and has brought his dimes in for his brother. Charley's boss named Johnny Friendly is the man who is behind Terry's fame, but he is also the same man who nibbled his dimes from boxing.The curtain opens with Terry working for Johnny Friendly to be participated in a murder. He does his duty and the murder takes effect. The victim was a labor, whose labor leader also works for Johhny Friendly. Terry turns gloomy when he finds out that the victim has been only seeking his rights when he became a rebel. Especially when Terry meets with the victim's sister his suspects grew. She reasons with him that there are two opposite sides: Johnny Friendly's rich and still-growing syndicate versus the dependent and needy workers who are driven into Johnny Friendly's punitive sanctions. Provided that Terry finds a third side: His own.A run of the mill plot of the mid-20th century. Everybody is pretty much familiar with labor union issues. Mainly the subject gives nothing more than workers seeking out their rights. However, consider that it's Elia Kazan who ushers a new era of actors who rage the whole scenes and turn out heroes out of bums. On the Waterfront has surely inspired millions. For instance, in Robert De Niro's ""Raging Bull"", a prize-fighter like Terry Malloy turns out to be a stage actor and affirms Terry's speech of reproach to his brother, where no other words could describe his situation he fell into.Marlon Brando's can-do attitude created an inspirational movement, imprinting our memory, that ""If Terry Malloy can do this, yes; I can do this, and yes; everybody can do this"". Subsequently movie makers began to deliver efforts and accomplishments to the silver screen in order to catch viewers' appreciations.

6.0,Hypocritical Meta-Fiction,"ON THE WATERFRONT is considered to one of the great classics of American cinema . It's easy to see why . It's a story that involves a nobody standing up to a powerful and corrupt organisation and doing the right thing , of one man making a difference . However it's impossible to watch this once you know the background of the director Elia Kazan . A Turkish immigrant to America he started off in theater and along with Lee Strasberg introduced something called "" Method acting "" where the actor gets in to the psychological depths and motivation of their character and effectively becomes that character . Where as previously film stars like Clark Gable , Errol Flynn etc etc were always playing a different shade of themselves a new breed of actors in the 1950s such as James Dean and Marlon Brando brought the method acting style to cinema and the method hit new heights in the late 1960s and 70s with New Hollywood . Perhaps we should be thankful for Kazan ? Maybe but the downside was Kazan was not a nice person at all from a very important moral viewpoint This film features a corrupt union who are fleecing the workers and lining their own pockets . The Waterfront Crime Commission are very interested in bringing down this corrupt union but they have a problem in that no one wants to talk to them and the union are more than happy to arrange accidents for suspected informers such as throwing people off roofs and fearing that former boxer Terry Molloy might snitch on them because they murdered the brother of a girl Molloy is falling in love with decide to put heavy pressure on him . You might like to consider that a couple of years previously Kazan was more than happy to testify in front of The House Of Un-American Activities and named eight former colleagues he knew from the American communist party with these eight people then being blacklisted . In effect he grassed them up and stabbed his friends in the back .With friends like that who needs enemies ? Continually this film screams that informing on "" bad guys "" is all that's needed for good to defeat evil and unfortunately while being a red might not necessarily make you a bad person there does seem to be some sort of moral equivalence of being a murderous gangster and someone suspected of leftist leanings . I mean it doesn't matter what someone has done because if they've done something wrong then they've only got themselves to blame if someone snitches on them isn't that right ? . A snitch is a good thing There's also a large dose of irony . The only character with a moral compass is Father Barry played by Karl Malden . Yeah I mean a Catholic priest makes for a superlative role model . Yeah I'm sure if Father Barry found out about a paedophile ring for example he'd be round the police station right away naming names ? Or maybe not . After the death of a longshoreman who knows too much Father Barry pleads in the name of Jesus for the workers to rise up against their cruel union bosses who are taking the bread from hungry babies and using it to pay for expensive suits .Let's think about this for a tiny second . If the character of Barry wasn't a priest and just an ordinary worker , and who doesn't mention Jesus and pointed out the exploitation the workers were experiencing what sort of person would Barry be ? No doubt a good guy but one with leftist , almost certainly fundamental Marxist leanings , in which case he'd automatically be blacklisted as a filthy red . Oh it's an entirely different ball game now eh comrade ? Yet another example of Americans not getting irony .

,Either it works for you ...,"... or it doesn't. This movie is considered a classic, but it may not appeal to as broad an audience as it once did. Unfortunately, I ended being part of the group that it did not really appeal to. As ground-breaking and artful as this movie may have been, to me, most of the elements were too commonplace by today's standards to be enjoyable.The movie is about a dockworker (Brando) who witnesses a murder of a fellow worker who was going to testify against the mob. The mob, as it turns out, runs the docking business on the waterfront. Brando's character was comfortable playing ""deaf and dumb"" to the murder until he meets and falls for the murdered man's sister. Add in a priest that weighs heavily on his conscience, and you can see where the movie is headed.The ideas involving whistle-blowing, inner moral conflict and even corrupt bosses vs. innocent laborers have been pretty well played out do date ... so as powerful as they once may have been, they are not quite as effective to a modern viewer.Brando's performance was clearly good and will forever stand the test of time. The way he moves, speaks and even communicates through his body-language is impressive. We can perceive his conflict and struggle through his mannerisms and the delivery of his words. Good as his performance was, it was not quite enough to make up for the familiarity of the plot.Because this movie is so well respected and celebrated, the prudent thing to say is to check the movie and see what you think. My rating only reflects the fact that it's not an automatic win in everyone's book; my guess is that you'll know in the first 15 minutes if this movie is going to appeal to you.",either it works you,or it doesnt this movie is considered classic but it may not appeal as broad audience as it once did unfortunately i ended being part group that it did not really appeal as ground breaking artful as this movie may have been me most elements were too commonplace by todays standards be enjoyable movie is about dockworker brando who witnesses murder fellow worker who was going testify against mob mob as it turns out runs docking business waterfront brandos character was comfortable playing deaf dumb murder until he meets falls murdered mans sister add priest that weighs heavily his conscience you can see where movie is headed ideas involving whistle blowing inner moral conflict even corrupt bosses vs innocent laborers have been pretty well played out do date so as powerful as they once may have been they are not quite as effective modern viewer brandos performance was clearly good will forever stand test time way he moves speaks even communicates through his body language is impressive we can perceive his conflict struggle through his mannerisms delivery his words good as his performance was it was not quite enough make up familiarity plot because this movie is so well respected celebrated prudent thing say is check movie see what you think my rating only reflects fact that its not automatic win everyones book my guess is that youll know first 15 minutes if this movie is going appeal you,0.5991666666666667,0.22416666666666665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Content With Ignorance.,"It's difficult to review a film that in almost all respects comes together exactly as it was intended to. There's not much left to criticize.The plot: Brando is Terry Malloy, a dock worker on the waterfront who gets mixed up with an innocent young schoolgirl, Saint, is persuaded by her and the local priest (Malden) to rat on his corrupt union bosses, is shunned by everyone because he has squealed, is even ridiculed by police officers, is beaten to a pulp, and is redeemed.I watched Kazan shooting one of the scenes -- Nehemiah Persoff drives Rod Steiger into the basement garage -- while I was growing up in the area and thought nothing of it at the time. Gee, another movie.On its release, my friends and I were somewhat surprised at how well Boris Kaufmann's perceptive photography captured the wintry streets of Hoboken, New Jersey, and at how much the people and their faces were recognizable types.As an adult, I was -- and still am -- stunned at how closely this movie approaches perfection. It's one of a small handful to which I would give the highest possible rating.There isn't much point in listing the details that make this such an outstanding story. It would require a book or two. But I'll make special mention of the first scene gum-chewing Brando and Saint have together, walking a little aimlessly through a children's playground. The air is filled with smoke from burning leaves. Brando pushes away a drunk asking for money. They remind each other of the schooldays they shared. Saint drops her white -- her very white -- glove accidentally and while they chat Brando picks it up and fiddles with it, brushing off the dirt, trying it on. ""You was a mess,"" says Brando of Saint as a little girl. ""I remember you from the first time I saw you,"" Saint replies with a self-conscious smile. The ex boxer Brando pushes his nose with with a fingertip -- ""The nose, right?"" Unable to understand that a pretty and innocent blond girl from a convent could find him interesting for his own sake. That's all there is to the scene, but it's almost flawlessly executed. What begins with two near strangers strolling through a dismal and leafless little park ends with a young man and woman who now can imagine themselves as friends, or more than friends. It's impossible to imagine how the scene could have been improved.No movie is perfect in every respect and this one becomes a little mechanical towards the last third. The courtroom scene is the weakest, although it's hard to see how it might have been left out. It's one of the best American films ever made and to miss it is to miss an awful lot.",content with ignorance,its difficult review film that almost all respects comes together exactly as it was intended theres not much left criticize plot brando is terry malloy dock worker waterfront who gets mixed up with innocent young schoolgirl saint is persuaded by her local priest malden rat his corrupt union bosses is shunned by everyone because he has squealed is even ridiculed by police officers is beaten pulp is redeemed i watched kazan shooting one scenes nehemiah persoff drives rod steiger into basement garage while i was growing up area thought nothing it at time gee another movie its release my friends i were somewhat surprised at how well boris kaufmanns perceptive photography captured wintry streets hoboken new jersey at how much people their faces were recognizable types as adult i was still am stunned at how closely this movie approaches perfection its one small handful which i would give highest possible rating there isnt much point listing details that make this such outstanding story it would require book or two but ill make special mention first scene gum chewing brando saint have together walking little aimlessly through childrens playground air is filled with smoke burning leaves brando pushes away drunk asking money they remind each other schooldays they shared saint drops her white her very white glove accidentally while they chat brando picks it up fiddles with it brushing off dirt trying it you was mess says brando saint as little girl i remember you first time i saw you saint replies with self conscious smile ex boxer brando pushes his nose with with fingertip nose right unable understand that pretty innocent blond girl convent could find him interesting his own sake thats all there is scene but its almost flawlessly executed what begins with two near strangers strolling through dismal leafless little park ends with young man woman who now can imagine themselves as friends or more than friends its impossible imagine how scene could have been improved no movie is perfect every respect this one becomes little mechanical towards last third courtroom scene is weakest although its hard see how it might have been left out its one best american films ever made miss it is miss awful lot,0.49833374172996814,0.07680919709221597,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.29}"
