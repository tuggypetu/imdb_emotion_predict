10,Note to Hollywood: This is how you make an action film.,"And yes, I'd consider this more of an action film than Sci/fi since it takes place in contemporary times and locations. Nowadays, it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their Nintendos/Playstations/whatever. So they come up with all of these PG-13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books, toys, or old TV shows. Looking back at T2, one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.The story of course deals with Arnold returning from the future to protect a boy who will some day lead the human resistance against a world run by machines. This time Arnold is the good guy (as per Schwarzenegger's request) and he's up against a lethal and much more advanced prototype sent to off the kid. The CGI used to create this new T-1000 terminator was jaw-dropping at the time this was released. Though technology to create such things is now infinitely more available, this has led to problems in my book. Now, there is too much done with computers, and stunts don't seem so wonderful if you know it was all done on a computer. Most of the stunts in T2 were live action and extraordinarily filmed using all types of vehicles and explosives. Director James Cameron really sold these stunts in terms of how he filmed them.Not all directors are a good as Cameron. That is a given. But directors looking at making action films should take note of other strengths found in the construction of T2. First of all, you don't need shaky camera movements to sell to your audience that there is an exciting or crucial scene happening. Here the photography is crisp and detailed. You see everything clearly that you need to see. Right down to the little things. The action sequences are perfectly blocked and the spacing between hostile parties is easy for the audience to figure out. We know who is shooting at who, and how far apart they are from each other. Cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with the weapons they were going to fire in the movie. And guns run out of ammunition and need to be re-loaded at appropriate times. Nothing seems artificial in a shootout.I could go on forever pointing out good qualities of this film. Just watching a bit of it on Bravo the other night reminded me why I saw it so many times in the theater. And this film was rated R! And it still made a fortune! That just proves if you make a good product, you don't have to dumb it down or tame it for the kiddies. If it's good enough, they'll find a way to see it! 10 of 10 stars. Unfortunately, the inspiration seems to have left this series with Cameron.The Hound.",note hollywood this is how you make action film,yes id consider this more action film than sci fi since it takes place contemporary times locations nowadays it can be hard distinguish action film video game fact there is one coming out soon that appears be both i guess studios these days feel that kids need something see while resting their fingers after long days playing their nintendos playstations whatever so they come up with all these pg 13 action films that are often mere meditations comic books toys or old tv shows looking back at t2 one may find action films today sorely lacking comparison story course deals with arnold returning future protect boy who will some day lead human resistance against world run by machines this time arnold is good guy as per schwarzeneggers request hes up against lethal much more advanced prototype sent off kid cgi used create this new t 1000 terminator was jaw dropping at time this was released though technology create such things is now infinitely more available this has led problems my book now there is too much done with computers stunts dont seem so wonderful if you know it was all done computer most stunts t2 were live action extraordinarily filmed using all types vehicles explosives director james cameron really sold these stunts terms how he filmed them not all directors are good as cameron that is given but directors looking at making action films should take note other strengths found construction t2 first all you dont need shaky camera movements sell your audience that there is exciting or crucial scene happening here photography is crisp detailed you see everything clearly that you need see right down little things action sequences are perfectly blocked spacing between hostile parties is easy audience figure out we know who is shooting at who how far apart they are each other cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with weapons they were going fire movie guns run out ammunition need be re loaded at appropriate times nothing seems artificial shootout i could go forever pointing out good qualities this film just watching bit it bravo other night reminded me why i saw it so many times theater this film was rated r it still made fortune that just proves if you make good product you dont have dumb it down or tame it kiddies if its good enough theyll find way see it 10 10 stars unfortunately inspiration seems have left this series with cameron hound,0.4542748917748918,0.16252339240620486,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10,This is the sequel that dreams are made of.,"Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good, Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list; why? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies, next to Die Hard, this is the movie that isn't just about the action as well, but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines, moments, and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in ""liquid metal"" machines. Robert Patrick's performance is flawless, to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator, because Robert looks like this normal average guy, but he's not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he's a terminator, Robert goes back to human looking and won't stop. Not only that you don't know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl, she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he's better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him, he's great entertainment.Eleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her, two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered, while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer. John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents. Sarah's experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant, but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse. After attempting to bomb a computer factory, Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman. Meanwhile, the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall. After John is rescued and a chase through the L.A. storm drain channels, the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle. The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John's younger self. The other Terminator is a T-1000, an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John. It is made of ""a mimetic polyalloy"", a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches. It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons. Learning that the T-1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John, John orders the Terminator to help free her. Initially, Sarah is terrified by the Terminator; but after seeing it fight off the T-1000, she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet, the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on ""Judgment Day"".Terminator 2 is one of the best films of all time, this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn't seen it, there's something seriously wrong. This story is a special one: humans, are we our own worst enemy? Arnold's line ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"" is something that always sends chills down my spine because it's true. I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong, interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie's eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator. Like Sarah Conor said "" The terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him. It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. And it would die to protect him."" meant a lot to me. Like I said, if for some odd reason you have seen this movie, do see it! I promise you that it's just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history.10/10",this is sequel that dreams are made,normally when people tell you about sequel that was better than original or just as good terminator 2 is always guaranteed be their list why because this is action movie all action movies next die hard this is movie that isnt just about action as well but has incredible story message behind it that will always stay with you terminator 2 like first terminator film has memorable lines moments incredible effects this is film that made you believe liquid metal machines robert patricks performance is flawless be honest i found him million times more terrifying than arnold first terminator because robert looks like this normal average guy but hes not like arnold where he gets shot you can clearly see hes terminator robert goes back human looking wont stop not only that you dont know how stop him linda hamilton returns gives great performance as sarah conor who is no longer meek little girl she has turned into strong woman who will do anything protect her son future arnold is back hes better then ever no wonder future they made several terminators that look like him hes great entertainment eleven years after sarah connor destroyed original terminator that was programmed kill her two terminators arrive los angeles year 2029 first is terminator identical one that sarah first encountered while second is new model which assumes identity police officer john connor is now 10 year old living with foster parents sarahs experiences have made her tougher more vigilant but also desperate warn humanity about coming apocalypse after attempting bomb computer factory sarah is arrested remanded pescadero state hospital criminally insane under supervision dr silberman meanwhile terminators locate john connor mall after john is rescued chase through l storm drain channels original terminator escapes with john his motorcycle terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by future john connor protect obey johns younger self other terminator is t 1000 advanced new prototype programmed kill john it is made mimetic polyalloy liquid metal that allows it take shape appearance anything it touches it can also form into knifes stabbing weapons learning that t 1000 will likely kill sarah then mimic her lure john john orders terminator help free her initially sarah is terrified by terminator but after seeing it fight off t 1000 she accepts that they need its help as they escape city terminator informs john sarah about skynet sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity apocalyptic nuclear attack judgment day terminator 2 is one best films all time this is film that i absolutely adore if someone hasnt seen it theres something seriously wrong this story is special one humans are we our own worst enemy arnolds line its your nature destroy yourselves is something that always sends chills down my spine because its true i loved relationship between arnold eddie furlong interesting see terminator take place perfectly father you see pain eddies eyes never wanting let go terminator like sarah conor said terminator wouldnt stop it would never leave him it would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk hit him or say it was too busy spend time with him it would die protect him meant lot me like i said if some odd reason you have seen this movie do see it i promise you that its just excellent film one that will always stand out against cinematic history 10 10,0.5276207751559864,0.16425090949738838,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10,He Said He'd Be Back...and He Certainly is!,"Who said sequels aren't any good? ""Terminator 2"" is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, is it wonderful.Yeah, he's ""back."" Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)Another model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won't be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)Whew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it's got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn't in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and ""Xtreme"" edition DVDs, Sarah says, ""You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things!"" It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), ""T2"" clearly has an underlying message: One, don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can't everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this: Is ""T2: Judgment Day"" better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.In some ways, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.5/5 stars.",he said hed be back he certainly is,who said sequels arent any good terminator 2 is ultimate sequel big bad wolf ready chomp head off anyone who crosses its path its dark its mean its one tough movie its not as bleak as first film at least terms visuals but rather has new kind bluish tint that supplies great backdrop ongoing battle between man machine if there was ever contemporary mainstream visionary director it is james cameron here weve got camerons real thoughts series those repressed by low budget original film he lets loose here filling every frame with hard boiled action special effects he introduces liquid metal terminator that he wanted use first film but graphic processors cgi were not advanced enough 1984 at least not advanced enough work low means he had film original so his original dream is finally unveiled good golly is it wonderful yeah hes back arnold like he needs any introduction returns as terminator series t 101 model t 800 indestructible cyborg sent future assassinate sarah connor linda hamilton first film well its 1991 new film new mission he has save future resistance leader mankind who will ultimately defeat machines future john connor edward furlong sarahs 11 year old son though his age has been switched 11 13 back 9 over years with no help third film that takes place 2003 yet claims he was 13 1991 though his age doesnt match with his age third well just leave it at 11 this film got that another model terminator t 1000 robert patrick has been sent back 1991 programmed annihilate john connor which explains arnolds appearance arnold undoubtedly lesser opponent compared t 1000 has help save day learn appreciate humanity it wont be easy first he has find john connor who is rebellious angst driven pre teen living with foster parents then together they have break into local loony hospital release sarah clutches dr silberman earl boen who believes sarah is delusional you may remember silberman as psychiatrist first film too then they have stop computer chip designer joe morton creating first version skynet computer modeled after destroyed chip his employment company discovered at large mechanical warehouse which is course chip destroyed t 800 first film whew with film analysis right where start this isnt as fierce or brutal as first film but its got plentiful action sequences large budget great special effects even compared those gracing screen nowadays not mention great character study machine we loved root against first film course this terminator has no memory first film since he wasnt it skynet creates hordes same version machines large conveyor belt ships them off fight war some are sent back through time so with that mind john connors resistance found extra arnold lying around abandoned warehouse programmed him keep john connor out harm sent him through time portal sarah doesnt trust him deleted scene available ultimate xtreme edition dvds sarah says you dont know what its like try kill one these things its important scene that should have been left final cut it sarah is about destroy machines central processing chip located inside his head when john stops her its important because it focuses fact that sarah still doesnt trust him came close destroying him purely out prejudice without giving him chance as much as i dont like it when people go about hidden meanings films that obviously are not meant have hidden meanings are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed deeper meaning s t2 clearly has underlying message one dont judge book by its cover read it first two if emotionless killing machine can learn appreciate life why cant everyone three most important fact all never mess with muscular man who walks into bar completely naked requests your clothes means transportation i suppose question most interested viewers minds is this is t2 judgment day better than its predecessor well some respects yes others no it lacks fierce brutality darkness first film but makes up it with spectacular visual effects action sequences it lacks horrific central focus first film futuristic indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able unemotionally kill but it makes up this with new focus humanity coming accept your future how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into arena together some ways i like first better but then i think about second film i have hard time choosing i suppose if i had choose id choose first film let me just state record that im glad i dont have choose 5 5 stars,0.44668661049095826,0.12279916942960424,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10,The best action sequel of all time and one of the best Schwarzenegger's movies my personal favorite,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T-800 did an awesome Terrific real job, he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world. Robert Patrick as T-1000 is ""a mimetic Polly-alloy"" or ""liquid metal."" He can shape shift to match other people he touches, after first arriving in present time, he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes, T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop is awesome. It shows what his character can do. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real, tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger: amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to). Edward Furlong, is the only John Connor for me, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator (1984) that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances, those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action, science fiction sequel films of all time. Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T-1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI, except special effects for T-1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes, produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie ""You Could Be Mine"" and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T-800 in the music video for this movie. The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors, stunts, puppetry, models and special effects designed from Stan Winston. It is Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language, it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",best action sequel all time one best schwarzeneggers movies my personal favorite,terminator 2 judgment day is 1991 is best action sci fi flick movie 90s ever made all time terminator 2 is my personal favorite film i absolutely love this movie death is my number 1 best movie ever till today best best epic movie all time t2 was nominated 4 oscars only movie franchise was nominated oscar if you watch t2 carefully follow story you never got bored you are very entertained this movie kicks ass i love hospital scenes mostly at night cyberdyne building action sequences course steel mill action sequences are perfect this film this film deals with lot action sci fi does involves lot paradox past travel there is lot explosions automatic weapons used movie they are used well thousands bullets are fired explosive projectiles are fired at police cars arnold schwarzenegger as good terminator t 800 did awesome terrific real job he acted believably as one his best characters i ever saw screen terminator walks front building kicks desk out window than ignores polices order surrender fires m134 minigun with chainsaw grip at police cars below avoiding humans helicopter pilot moves away terminator than uses m79 grenade launcher destroy two more vehicles its heads up display indicates no human casualties film has heart is best film world robert patrick as t 1000 is mimetic polly alloy or liquid metal he can shape shift match other people he touches after first arriving present time he decides have his base form be that nearby cop he killed passes himself off as cop that form truck chase scene is awesome crash is also awesome truck that hit another column canal explodes t 1000 emerges as shiny featureless liquid metal figure its features become more pronounced its colors return normal returning form unharmed pseudo cop is awesome it shows what his character can do linda hamilton is only sarah connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius very convincing real tough beyond all belief completely focused preventing nuclear war ensuring johns safety sarah connor is her best performance ever both terminator films little out her mind with paranoia anger amazingly you see actual character development specifically when john t101 arrive at dysons house prevent her doing what she wants edward furlong is only john connor me is not bad himself as extroverted kid whos confused by fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based lie bit players all do their jobs well earl boen plays semi sadistic mental hospital warden dr silberman first film terminator 1984 that stands between sarah connor her son until t1000 makes chilling entrance arnold schwarzenegger linda hamilton edward furlong robert patrick did there best acting performances those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days terminator 2 has since been ranked as one greatest action science fiction sequel films all time twin sister linda hamilton also appeared as leslie hamilton gearren as twin sarah dream she was real there wasnt no cgi here twin brothers don stanton dan stanton both actors appeared here one as lewis guard other as lewis as t 1000 who kills lewis they were real no cgi except special effects t 1000 knife terminator special effects were designed by stan winston r i p who has done incredible job making those effects film is absolutely filled with great classic moments t2 is james cameron masterpiece this wouldnt be action movie without some action james cameron writes produces directs brilliantly this film brad fiedel does perfect music score film american rock band guns n roses wrote single this movie you could be mine schwarzenegger appeared music video as t 800 music video this movie chopper scene that crashed swat van explodes was awesome cgi special effects are awesome this movie is what it is perfect 10 because it takes vision one most imaginative directors earth realizes them almost perfectly with all tools that fit task actors stunts puppetry models special effects designed stan winston it is rated r strong sci fi action violence language it is perfect film 90s that i have grew up with it 10 10 score bad ass seal approval,0.5398437499999998,0.3514198908730158,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10,surpasses the original,"Terminator 2 perhaps shows that Cameron was at least was cognizant of life and its meaning. I mean, this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove, right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies, one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity, Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.So it's with this kind of thought that Terminator 2 means to be the most kick-assingest blockbuster of its (or all?) time while trying to keep the loss of life very small - or, rather, the ""Bad"" Terminator who was designed by the wizards at ILM can kill to its mission's content - I mean, DAMN, it still looks great, and in its silver-liquid-chrome simplicity much more, for me, impressive than the clanging junk of Bay disasters. It's arguable, of course, that the Terminator (T-800) does kill some people, incidentally, or, you know, all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but, hey, ""He'll live"" is enough.But if Cameron is ""soft"" at all here, it doesn't show too much... well, okay, Lil' John (hehe) does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms ""No Problemo - chill out - listen to Kriss Kross - etc"", and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best, annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.But it's Arnold, in his swaggering low-key and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn, and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his one-time wife/collaborator Bigelow - a take-no-prisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head (maybe that's why they divorced, he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress, at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife) And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing. She can never be completely hard, though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her, so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World, she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters (something like Days of Future Past, which is a cousin of this flick, gets there). The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad, but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero, one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.So, blast your Guns N Roses, say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts (that's him, right, Connor's friend in the first act?) and ride your motorcycle through LA - it's a bad mother-jammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults (i.e. some dialog isn't tight, like the voice-over, it's alright but whatever - perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie, which the first Terminator just was).",surpasses original,terminator 2 perhaps shows that cameron was at least was cognizant life its meaning i mean this is movie where end world has most impact outside dr strangelove right one those outstanding dream scenes movies one ones that actually works because its true its savage simplicity linda hamiltons sarah connor sees herself her 1984 waitress get up with baby john playground then everything gets wiped out by big bomb dmitri that also incinerates hamilton into bbq so its with this kind thought that terminator 2 means be most kick assingest blockbuster its or all time while trying keep loss life very small or rather bad terminator who was designed by wizards at ilm can kill its missions content i mean damn it still looks great its silver liquid chrome simplicity much more me impressive than clanging junk bay disasters its arguable course that terminator t 800 does kill some people incidentally or you know all that gas gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but hey hell live is enough but if cameron is soft at all here it doesnt show too much well okay lil john hehe does squeak squak those early 90s amorphisms no problemo chill out listen kriss kross etc edward furlong is one things that just does not hold up here hes serviceable at best annoying at worst he can cry okay though but its arnold his swaggering low key then with occasional grin awesome leading man turn especially linda hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable hamilton makes connor into what cameron likely saw his one time wife collaborator bigelow take no prisoners soldier who can take charge has muscles can probably knock you upside head maybe thats why they divorced he couldnt take all that woman but i digress at any rate he moved around lot till his current wife there is also vulnerability still sarah that makes her so endearing she can never be completely hard though time experience dread whats come had scarred her so by time she has chance kill man who destroys world she cant do it scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try these blockbusters something like days future past which is cousin this flick gets there fact hamilton wasnt able parlay such high caliber performance work into better career is kind sad but at least this stands as benchmark woman action hero one two cameron wonder women really so blast your guns n roses say hi kid salute your shorts thats him right connors friend first act ride your motorcycle through la its bad mother jammer blockbuster that holds up enough look over its faults i e some dialog isnt tight like voice over its alright but whatever perhaps it was ambitious enough best perfect action movie which first terminator just was,0.5291465201465201,0.1549074259074259,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10,Words cannot describe the greatness of this movie,"A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator"" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.I highly recommend this movie.",words cannot describe greatness this movie,terminator arnold schwarzenegger was sent future kill unborn son sarah connor linda hamilton original now that terminator has been sent back again but with different assignment protect john connor john connor edward furlong is now about 10 years age must evade new terminator sent kill him t 1000 robert patrick sarah john terminator journey together their quest stop judgement day with trailing shape shifting termiantor trailing behind this is greatest terminator trilogy i have watched three times past year have not found anything that cameron could have improved move is masterpiece every aspect film schwarzeneggers acting might not be incredible but this is perfect role him he isnt supposed show emotion or feelings he is machine i hate almost every one his movies besides this trilogy because he is horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role special effects are incredible beyond belief shape shifting t 1000 is some greatest animation i have witnessed cinema history it absolutely blew my mind when i first experienced this visual extravaganza animation looked so real remembering this was good ten years movie included fast paced action along with some clever sci fi drama horror idea vast army machines taking over world after sending off warheads every major city should be scary enough but t 1000 has very little lines is just creepy enough make twitch when you see him sci fi movies can rarely be made such way that can be looked at as works art this is one few exceptions prediction judgment day with hamilton watching playground full kids be burnt ground is absolute brilliant portrayal armageddon theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout movie also is even said by terminator its your nature destroy yourselves this brings movie whole new level sci fi overall termiantor ii judgement day is absolute must see classic if you have not seen it buy it because once you have seen it you will want do so anyways it is fast paced highly enjoyable just about every audience i highly recommend this movie,0.5695770562770562,0.16733906926406927,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10,"A bigger, richer sequel that is every bit as fantastic as its predecessor and even surpasses it in some areas","The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.Here in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.Terminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.Linda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.In conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox",bigger richer sequel that is every bit as fantastic as its predecessor even surpasses it some areas,original terminator film is one greatest films action genre still holds up as fantastic film not just its genre but general too terminator 2 judgement day is considered one best sequels ever made it is consensus that i agree with while it does lack somewhat its predecessors darkness brutality it delivers just as much writing action feels bigger richer here terminator 2 judgement day budget is clearly bigger this is especially true special effects they were only things first film that didnt hold up as well as rest film but they were still not bad at all here effects are stunning liquid melting effects t 1000 model blow mind still today it is photographed slickly beautifully maintaining dark audaciousness first film while sets lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative atmospheric it is superbly directed by james cameron its scored appropriately hauntingly terminator 2 judgement days script is just as snappy even takes hard edged tone some parts more so than original while roller coaster action is thrilling every sense without being overblown or dominating film too much at expense depth bigger budget aiding adding experience rather than swamping it story is still enormous fun beautifully paced with few if any longueurs very suspenseful linda hamilton gives another terrific performance that is more depth than her performance first film robert patrick is spine chilling once again arnold schwarzenegger is perfectly cast by far his most conic role that was tailor made him conclusion fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one best sequels ever made its only terminator sequel be close quality original only one thats above good level me if asked which is better film between first film this theyre about equal their own ways 10 10 bethany cox,0.6093290043290044,0.3016450216450216,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.24}"

10,The purest form of action cinema there is,"At the time of release, this was one of the biggest, most expensive, box office hits ever made. Obviously that reputation has long since been diminished by films which have come since, but I still remember the hype and excitement that surrounded this film when I was but a ten year old boy. Containing Arnold Schwarzenegger's most accessible, likable performance, it's difficult to find fault with this near-masterpiece of adrenaline-pumping action.Essentially it's just a string of set pieces linked together by a few scenes of dialogue. There's little drama or acting involved - all the characters are clear-cut - basically, the film goes from one outstanding action sequence to another. And these action scenes are truly wonderful. There are five in all; each more exciting and meaningful than the last. The first comes when the T-800 and T-100 finally meet up and have a huge battle in a hallway, smashing walls down and throwing each other through windows. The battle of the titans continues outside in a riveting truck chase, stopped only by a huge explosion. The third suspenseful set-piece shows just how unstoppable the T-1000 is, as the goodies and baddies battle over rescuing Sarah Connor from her mental asylum. Then there's lot of gunfire and explosions in the Cyberdyne building siege, until the final climatic battle between good and evil at a steel mill.If THE ABYSS was the first film to really introduce CGI, TERMINATOR 2 is the first film to really make use of its facilities and to place them in a context - unlike later entries which tried to make non-computerised things look real, and failed. The T-1000's morphing shots are stunning, show-stopping, and exceptional, and they work because they are meant to look as such. Aside from these excellent morphing sequences (the scene involving the T-1000 coming out of a floor is probably the greatest), there's tons of ammunition and explosions flying across the screen at every opportunity. Arnie dons some realistic ""wound"" makeup in the final scenes of the film, and once again the makeup is flawless. The special effects are the best things in this film; the makeup, CGI work and stunts all come together in absolute perfection.The performance are spot on too; characters are introduced and are made charismatic, but thankfully are not dwelled upon. Edward Furlong makes an impressive debut as the streetwise, foul-mouthed kid who has a heart of gold, while Linda Hamilton has undergone a complete transformation from her victimised waitress in the first film to a muscular, lean killing machine herself. Robert Patrick helped to carve himself a niche for playing evil psychopaths, and his slim figure goes well with the morphing capabilities he possesses - he looks like a match for Arnie. But it's our friend Schwarzenegger who steals the film, starting out as a cold, calculating machine and in the end sacrificing himself for mankind. That this finale had me bursting into tears on more than one occasion shows just how good Arnie is in it. He's funny, heroic, likable and consistently impressive - what more could you want? Other familiar faces fill out the supporting cast, with the likes of Xander Berkeley and Earl Boen (returning from the first film) in minor roles.The violence isn't skirted, either...lots of people get impaled by the T-1000's knife-arms, plenty of men get shot in the knees (ouch), Arnie even cuts the skin off his own arm at one point. But this is primarily an action film, and should be treated as such. Every scene is flawlessly composed, with some little neat ideas thrown in almost everywhere - everything is portrayed coolly and stylishly, especially where Arnie is concerned. He really is the king of cool here - from the flick as he puts on his sunglasses to the shotgunning open of locked gates in split seconds to his final catchphrases - ""Hasta la Vista baby"" and ""I'll be back"" to name but two. And still there's more to praise: a moral behind the story, a suspenseful score, excellent opening titles, no lulls in the film whatsoever, nice photography, crisp editing...the list is, indeed, endless. In my youth, this was my most-watched film, and I can still watch it over without ever becoming bored. A masterpiece, plain and simple, and one of my very favourite films.",purest form action cinema there is,at time release this was one biggest most expensive box office hits ever made obviously that reputation has long since been diminished by films which have come since but i still remember hype excitement that surrounded this film when i was but ten year old boy containing arnold schwarzeneggers most accessible likable performance its difficult find fault with this near masterpiece adrenaline pumping action essentially its just string set pieces linked together by few scenes dialogue theres little drama or acting involved all characters are clear cut basically film goes one outstanding action sequence another these action scenes are truly wonderful there are five all each more exciting meaningful than last first comes when t 800 t 100 finally meet up have huge battle hallway smashing walls down throwing each other through windows battle titans continues outside riveting truck chase stopped only by huge explosion third suspenseful set piece shows just how unstoppable t 1000 is as goodies baddies battle over rescuing sarah connor her mental asylum then theres lot gunfire explosions cyberdyne building siege until final climatic battle between good evil at steel mill if abyss was first film really introduce cgi terminator 2 is first film really make use its facilities place them context unlike later entries which tried make non computerised things look real failed t 1000s morphing shots are stunning show stopping exceptional they work because they are meant look as such aside these excellent morphing sequences scene involving t 1000 coming out floor is probably greatest theres tons ammunition explosions flying across screen at every opportunity arnie dons some realistic wound makeup final scenes film once again makeup is flawless special effects are best things this film makeup cgi work stunts all come together absolute perfection performance are spot too characters are introduced are made charismatic but thankfully are not dwelled upon edward furlong makes impressive debut as streetwise foul mouthed kid who has heart gold while linda hamilton has undergone complete transformation her victimised waitress first film muscular lean killing machine herself robert patrick helped carve himself niche playing evil psychopaths his slim figure goes well with morphing capabilities he possesses he looks like match arnie but its our friend schwarzenegger who steals film starting out as cold calculating machine end sacrificing himself mankind that this finale had me bursting into tears more than one occasion shows just how good arnie is it hes funny heroic likable consistently impressive what more could you want other familiar faces fill out supporting cast with likes xander berkeley earl boen returning first film minor roles violence isnt skirted either lots people get impaled by t 1000s knife arms plenty men get shot knees ouch arnie even cuts skin off his own arm at one point but this is primarily action film should be treated as such every scene is flawlessly composed with some little neat ideas thrown almost everywhere everything is portrayed coolly stylishly especially where arnie is concerned he really is king cool here flick as he puts his sunglasses shotgunning open locked gates split seconds his final catchphrases hasta la vista baby ill be back name but two still theres more praise moral behind story suspenseful score excellent opening titles no lulls film whatsoever nice photography crisp editing list is indeed endless my youth this was my most watched film i can still watch it over without ever becoming bored masterpiece plain simple one my very favourite films,0.5649637848666975,0.1919479118508245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10,"Schwarzenegger's Best Film, Hands Down","Oh yeah, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""......The greatest overall action film next to ""Die Hard"" and the greatest science fiction one next to ""Aliens"". It is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time and I would give this 20 stars if I could and this is a film that everyone recognizes and knows about and this is a film that absolutely gets what it deserves.In 1991, Arnold Schwarzenegger had finally cemented his reputation as the world's greatest action star after a couple great classics (The Terminator, Predator, Total Recall and the Conan films). This is the movie that defined Schwarzenegger forever as the one and only ""Terminator"", the cyborg sent from the future to protect the kid (Edward Furlong) who will save the entire world. Even though he's a machine, he learns what humans need to do and what they were put on this Earth for. And like what action films lack, T2 develops its characters flawlessly, and yes, EVEN the Terminator is given development as a character! When the T-100 arrives to the mid 1990's, he is basically awkward and socially clueless and knows nothing about human emotion or interaction. As the film progresses, he learns how humans behave and learns a few one-liners from John (Hasta la Vista, baby) and Spoilers: at the end before the Terminator melts himself in molten steel, his humanity is completely obvious, ""I know now why you cry, for it is something I can never do."" And just before he completely disappears in the molten steel, he gives the ""thumbs-up"" gesture, something that John had taught him before.It is also probably the most heart-breaking ending and even the most insensitive guy will cry to that.Also, Linda Hamilton makes one of the greatest ever screen performances by a female, and even challenges the performance of Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"". And her character has really developed from the first movie. The main problem with most movie sequels that have been made is that they usually act like the film before it never happened. But Sarah Connor has transformed from a timid waitress into a smart and brutal militaristic woman. And it shows off James Cameron's film-making genius and he truly knows how to make a great action film and a great sequel to follow it, because of this and ""Aliens"" (which I will write up a review soon) 2 of the greatest sequels ever made. During the course of this film, Sarah Connor has already developed a phobia for Terminator's due to her experiences in the first movie. And during most of the film, she doesn't trust the Terminator at all and even tries to destroy its CPU chip (only in a deleted scene). But at the end, when the Terminator is just about to destroy itself, she shakes hands with him and makes peace with him.....very,very touching moment. Also, Hamilton did a great job at providing the narration, with some greatly written lines, and she utters them with perfect drama and suspense to reveal the story in the beginning and what's next for the future at the end.Also, Edward Furlong really makes a name for himself in his film debut. He is absolutely perfect as the juvenile offender who is affected by the absence of his mother and biological father. Throughout the film, he becomes attached to the Terminator and teaches him the meaning of human life. And no one else could've done the role better or equally as great. FYI, it's not really that easy for a kid with limited acting experience to pull it off.The line, ""She's not my mother, ''Todd''"" shows what Furlong can do and says that line with the perfect facial expression and delivery. And Furlong and Hamilton are really the 2 who provide the intense emotion that has capitalized James Cameron's films ever since.The villainous T-1000 (Robert Patrick) has gotta be the icon for movie villains, 'cause the whole ""liquid metal"" thing is so cool. And the film was even a landmark for special effects which make the action scenes stand out and make them among the best in the genre.This is further proof of why every action fan needs to have James Cameron alive to give em a reason to live. I'm already looking forward to ""Avatar"" and ""Battle Angel"", and I'm sure those 2 will kick @$$ once they come out.If it weren't for this film, every other action flick that you see these days wouldn't be the same. When you watch it, just keep in mind that this movie changed a lot of things. It's not just an excellent action epic, but a very emotionally charged story about human survival.",schwarzeneggers best film hands down,oh yeah terminator 2 judgment day greatest overall action film next die hard greatest science fiction one next aliens it is without doubt my favorite movie all time i would give this 20 stars if i could this is film that everyone recognizes knows about this is film that absolutely gets what it deserves 1991 arnold schwarzenegger had finally cemented his reputation as worlds greatest action star after couple great classics terminator predator total recall conan films this is movie that defined schwarzenegger forever as one only terminator cyborg sent future protect kid edward furlong who will save entire world even though hes machine he learns what humans need do what they were put this earth like what action films lack t2 develops its characters flawlessly yes even terminator is given development as character when t 100 arrives mid 1990s he is basically awkward socially clueless knows nothing about human emotion or interaction as film progresses he learns how humans behave learns few one liners john hasta la vista baby spoilers at end before terminator melts himself molten steel his humanity is completely obvious i know now why you cry it is something i can never do just before he completely disappears molten steel he gives thumbs up gesture something that john had taught him before it is also probably most heart breaking ending even most insensitive guy will cry that also linda hamilton makes one greatest ever screen performances by female even challenges performance sigourney weaver aliens her character has really developed first movie main problem with most movie sequels that have been made is that they usually act like film before it never happened but sarah connor has transformed timid waitress into smart brutal militaristic woman it shows off james camerons film making genius he truly knows how make great action film great sequel follow it because this aliens which i will write up review soon 2 greatest sequels ever made during course this film sarah connor has already developed phobia terminators due her experiences first movie during most film she doesnt trust terminator at all even tries destroy its cpu chip only deleted scene but at end when terminator is just about destroy itself she shakes hands with him makes peace with him very very touching moment also hamilton did great job at providing narration with some greatly written lines she utters them with perfect drama suspense reveal story beginning whats next future at end also edward furlong really makes name himself his film debut he is absolutely perfect as juvenile offender who is affected by absence his mother biological father throughout film he becomes attached terminator teaches him meaning human life no one else couldve done role better or equally as great fyi its not really that easy kid with limited acting experience pull it off line shes not my mother todd shows what furlong can do says that line with perfect facial expression delivery furlong hamilton are really 2 who provide intense emotion that has capitalized james camerons films ever since villainous t 1000 robert patrick has gotta be icon movie villains cause whole liquid metal thing is so cool film was even landmark special effects which make action scenes stand out make them among best genre this is further proof why every action fan needs have james cameron alive give em reason live im already looking forward avatar battle angel im sure those 2 will kick once they come out if it werent this film every other action flick that you see these days wouldnt be same when you watch it just keep mind that this movie changed lot things its not just excellent action epic but very emotionally charged story about human survival,0.46320282186948847,0.24316638608305283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10,It pushes the limits of greatness,"Probably this is the movie I enjoyed watching the most. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my all time favorite actors, I am a huge fan of him. It does not matter whether his acting is great or not (but in this movie, he is great I think) The Terminator 2 has humor at times, but because of that again rather critics give one star low! However, humor in the movie is not to entertain audiences. Humor in this movie results from natural situations, it seems that Cameron does not put such moments for our entertainment like the third Terminator movie. And this humor does not ruin the seriousness and the dark tone of the movie. I can't think of a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger. I have seen Terminator Salvation and yes, there was Arnold Schwarzenegger too, but CGI! (an awful idea) Terminator Salvation was OK, but not as a Terminator movie, as a post apocalyptic science fiction action. I want to say a few things more about Schwarzenegger. He was an icon by this character. Motorcycle, leather jacket, sunglasses and pump rifle. At this point, this is the most humanist, may be the only action movie ever! One of my favorite one liners is the movie is ''he will live.'' Connor tries to teach him not to kill people. Don't get me wrong, it does not mean that I don't like other action movies which do not give such a message, but this just makes the movie greater and deeper. By the way, Terminator 2 is also the deepest action movie ever. This is one of the movies that when you replace any of the actors, pieces don't fall into place. Schwarzenegger is like he was made for Terminator (and yes Conan too), Robert Patrick was made for T-100 (he was at his best in this movie, may be not for acting, but for performance) and Edward Furlong was made for John Connor. Honestly, personally it was impossible to believe that Nick Stahl is John Connor, I watched him like another character. Furlong portrays a very realistic rover portrait. As for Linda Hamilton, she was not made for Sarah Connor, but it is a big pleasure to watch her and for her acting, real very good. Musics always make me live nostalgia, great musics. Now, let's talk about the scenes. The atari center sequence is the first beyond great sequence. This movie is great entertainment, every time, it is a great pleasure to watch it. From the middle of 1990s till now, I watched the movie almost 50 times. I love the metal holes and then renew. How creative it is. As for visual effects, it is a touchstone, yes still. It is the greatest visual effects of all time to me, till 2012. Now, to me it became the second greatest. And I am sorry, I find the visual effects of T2 much more believable than Avatar. Yes I know, 3D, some other new technologies as well. but this is what I think. At a few moments, it is flawed like the scene they shoot at the face of Schwarzenegger, but no problem at all. Can you believe that this movie was made in 1991? I can't believe at all. That's why it is still a milestone. The chase sequence in the highway is beyond great too. Cameron raised the bar and I used to compare all the chase scenes with this one. Do you know another movie that in user comments, the titles which say the greatest action movie ever are innumerable? Almost everyone says the greatest action movie ever, the best action movie of all time, the greatest, the best... I will say the same thing. This is the greatest action movie of all time. The pump rifle using style of Terminator was getting my attention when I was a child. Still I like that. I just like gunfight scenes, not guns by the way. The hospital sequence is the third beyond great sequence, there are a lot of scenes that deserves cinema anthology in this movie. The coffee scene was incredible, every time makes me remember The Silver Surfer, we get lots of very interesting and brilliant moments like the shoot at head (not just in this sequence, throughout the whole movie) The Terminator is 10 out of 10, but T2 surpasses even that (you know I can't give 11 out of 10) Ohh By the way, I don't recommend you to watch the extended edition, if you are a first time viewer. There are three new scenes in this edition. The scene which Sarah hallucinates, to me a mediocre scene, the scene which T-100 tells Sarah and John where his chip is, an unnecessary scene and the scene which a kind of foreplay and talking between Tarissa and Miles while he works at desk, a cliché and a bit ridiculous scene. Returning to the movie, this is the best cat and mouse game movie with No Country for Old Men, it wouldn't be better. T-1000 is the most powerful, the most resistant (the most indestructible) villain ever! You think that he is terminated, but he is not, will he be terminated this time? The movie delivers such a feeling that I would define great success. Helicopter truck fight is great, another action sequence, I would call the kind of action in the movie metallic, not CGI action. By the way, mercury scene was one of the most shocking moments in the cinema history! Unbelievable, incredible. There is an unaccountable moment which it seems that Hulk was inspired from. Another moment recalls The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King etc. If you watched both movies, you understand what I mean. And T-1000 continues to execute his tricks, I was bowling over every time. This is a non stop action movie, but not shallow at all, not like pure action with no substance, in contrast the deepest action movie ever made.",it pushes limits greatness,probably this is movie i enjoyed watching most arnold schwarzenegger is one my all time favorite actors i am huge fan him it does not matter whether his acting is great or not but this movie he is great i think terminator 2 has humor at times but because that again rather critics give one star low however humor movie is not entertain audiences humor this movie results natural situations it seems that cameron does not put such moments our entertainment like third terminator movie this humor does not ruin seriousness dark tone movie i cant think terminator movie without schwarzenegger i have seen terminator salvation yes there was arnold schwarzenegger too but cgi awful idea terminator salvation was ok but not as terminator movie as post apocalyptic science fiction action i want say few things more about schwarzenegger he was icon by this character motorcycle leather jacket sunglasses pump rifle at this point this is most humanist may be only action movie ever one my favorite one liners is movie is he will live connor tries teach him not kill people dont get me wrong it does not mean that i dont like other action movies which do not give such message but this just makes movie greater deeper by way terminator 2 is also deepest action movie ever this is one movies that when you replace any actors pieces dont fall into place schwarzenegger is like he was made terminator yes conan too robert patrick was made t 100 he was at his best this movie may be not acting but performance edward furlong was made john connor honestly personally it was impossible believe that nick stahl is john connor i watched him like another character furlong portrays very realistic rover portrait as linda hamilton she was not made sarah connor but it is big pleasure watch her her acting real very good musics always make me live nostalgia great musics now lets talk about scenes atari center sequence is first beyond great sequence this movie is great entertainment every time it is great pleasure watch it middle 1990s till now i watched movie almost 50 times i love metal holes then renew how creative it is as visual effects it is touchstone yes still it is greatest visual effects all time me till 2012 now me it became second greatest i am sorry i find visual effects t2 much more believable than avatar yes i know 3d some other new technologies as well but this is what i think at few moments it is flawed like scene they shoot at face schwarzenegger but no problem at all can you believe that this movie was made 1991 i cant believe at all thats why it is still milestone chase sequence highway is beyond great too cameron raised bar i used compare all chase scenes with this one do you know another movie that user comments titles which say greatest action movie ever are innumerable almost everyone says greatest action movie ever best action movie all time greatest best i will say same thing this is greatest action movie all time pump rifle using style terminator was getting my attention when i was child still i like that i just like gunfight scenes not guns by way hospital sequence is third beyond great sequence there are lot scenes that deserves cinema anthology this movie coffee scene was incredible every time makes me remember silver surfer we get lots very interesting brilliant moments like shoot at head not just this sequence throughout whole movie terminator is 10 out 10 but t2 surpasses even that you know i cant give 11 out 10 ohh by way i dont recommend you watch extended edition if you are first time viewer there are three new scenes this edition scene which sarah hallucinates me mediocre scene scene which t 100 tells sarah john where his chip is unnecessary scene scene which kind foreplay talking between tarissa miles while he works at desk clich bit ridiculous scene returning movie this is best cat mouse game movie with no country old men it wouldnt be better t 1000 is most powerful most resistant most indestructible villain ever you think that he is terminated but he is not will he be terminated this time movie delivers such feeling that i would define great success helicopter truck fight is great another action sequence i would call kind action movie metallic not cgi action by way mercury scene was one most shocking moments cinema history unbelievable incredible there is unaccountable moment which it seems that hulk was inspired another moment recalls lord rings return king etc if you watched both movies you understand what i mean t 1000 continues execute his tricks i was bowling over every time this is non stop action movie but not shallow at all not like pure action with no substance contrast deepest action movie ever made,0.5008026208026208,0.263034446784447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10,Great action and much more,"The future John Connor has sent a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect the teenage John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the most advanced Terminator ever, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest, it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor, and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create.

10,"the best action film of all time, and NOT due to the CGI","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthouse-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1991!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.But, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.That's your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can't really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.What happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Schwarzenegger (the good terminator) and Patrick (the bad one) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking (and odd, given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two). Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, is a wonderful character -- tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety, yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger; amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to) in her otherwise 2-dimensional character. And Furlong, as John, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well, particularly Earl Boen who plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I mean, who doesn't cheer (at least inside) when Arnold steps out of the biker bar, fully clad in leather when ""Bad to the Bone"" music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But, with so many great moments, you'd think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense, never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk, always driving forward, but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The CG effects for the shape-shifting T1000 were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they're completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a helicopter flies under a highway overpass; at another, a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper). (Probably, only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Cameron-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content, and the movie has a very clear pro-human, anti-war message. The message is a bit stale, and the delivery IS, at times, a little heavy-handed (and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic, towards the end), but the movie has heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10",best action film all time not due cgi,disclaimer if you are viewer that mainly prefers arthouse type movies then you might as well ignore this review addition if youre

10,A piece of cinematic genius...,"I adore this movie. I could never stand action movies, but T2 is so intelligent and moving that it stands apart from everything else.First, the story - brilliant, smoothly making the necessary transition from T1. The dialogue runs the gamut from hilarious to heartbreaking, but always strikes exactly the right chord.The cinematography and effects are stunning, especially the scenes filmed during ""magic hour"", when the pale gold of sunset casts a meaningful and lovely effect on the scene. Being the first $100 million movie naturally the effects are remarkable for their time, but they hold up wonderfully against anything made today.It's the actors, however, who steal the show. Linda Hamilton can play insanity and despair like nobody's business, and she gave her all here. Robert Patrick was wonderful in the demanding role of the T-1000, creepy and threatening even during the funny finger-wagging moment. Arnold Schwarzenegger balances non-stop action with a machine's emerging humanity; frankly this movie cancels out every dumb action flick he ever made. New-comer Edward Furlong carried the film with seeming ease, giving an astonishing performance for his age and lack of experience; the ""We're not gonna make it, are we?"" scene is hauntingly perfect.James Cameron and his team have given us a classic that has something for everyone.

9,"A blazing big-budget sci-fi thriller, very creative, to be entirely experienced...","A strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in the sudden flare of light we see a figure in a sphere of energy... It is the figure of a naked man... 'Terminator' has come through... He stands, and impassively surveys its surroundings...His physique is massive and perfect... His face devoid of emotion... He's not here to kill Sara Connor... His mission now is to protect the future savior of mankind, her son John... Thirty years from now, Terminator was reprogrammed to be John Connor's protector here, in this time... Terminator would never leave him... Terminator would never hurt him... Terminator would die to defend him against any danger... But Skynet, the computer which controlled the Machines, sent an advanced prototype back through time, to destroy the leader of the human Resistance, little John... T-1000 is very menacing... His features are handsome bordering on severe... Its face is simple, unformed... His eyes are gray ice, penetrating... He is certainly not built like Terminator with complex hydraulics and cables... He is human-shaped but far from human... Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the super-hero... He never threatens, that's a human thing! He just takes... He can jerk any knife out without slowing a stride... His hand blurs out like a striking cobra...We watch him smashing the cover plate off the phone's cash box with the heel of his hand... And when the bullets rake his chest, he doesn't even draw back... We observe him in slow motion how he fights for control, how he jumps his bike, sweeps a street kid off his machine with one arm and swings him in front of him... Robert Patrick is a super-villain, a perfect chameleon... He can change shape and color... He can imitate anything it touches, anything it samples by physical contact, any object of equal size... He is a 'killing machine' with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society... He looks and acts exactly like a 'cop' but with quite a few surprises... His arms and fingers can be turned smoothly into something else... He spins at a sound... His blow is lighting fast... He pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol... He is cool, alert, confident in his power... His expression emotionless and judgmental... Linda Hamilton is not a mission priority... She is the same woman we remember from last time... Her body is straight and taut... Her arms are lean and muscular... Her eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered animal... Her voice is a low and chilling monotone... Her expression cold and impassive... She is defiant and intense... She looks hard... Hamilton seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder.. She draws her knife from its belt sheath, and idly starts to carve something on the table top, the letter ""N."" Something changes in her eyes... Her face is an impassive mask... We see the forces at war behind her eyes... She has become a 'Terminator,' intending to change the future somehow... Edward Furlong is young John Connor... He is a ten-year tough delinquent, targeted for termination... He has short yellowish hair and a sullen mouth... His eyes reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel... His interactions with his 'protector' give the movie effective moments of psychological depth... He reluctantly shows his friend a shot of his mother, pregnant, in a jeep near the Mexican border... John doesn't know it now, but he will carry the photo with him for over 30 years, and give it to a young man named Kyle Reese, who will travel back in time to become his father...Joe Morton is Miles Dyson, the star of the Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation... He is a man in a hurry, a man with much to do... He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.. In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor... He can be the man most directly responsible for 3 billion deaths on August 29th, 1997... The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day, will live only to face a new nightmare, the war against the Machines...His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching terror... This is a man ripped out of normal life into a grim world... He looks up, through his pain and incomprehension, and asks himself: Why is this nightmare happening? The level of violence in Cameron's film is pretty intense... The special effects are outstanding... They look realistic... The action scenes are amazing, very well executed...

10,There's a reason this is so appreciated,"Let it be said right away: There is at least one obvious issue with this. That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first, it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who, with good cause, deny there to be a third movie... heck, I am one of them), but I could see why there could be. However, if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so, as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success), you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all, Patrick is an incredible addition, and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger, and still consists of fights, shootouts and car chases, all of which are marvelous and exciting, and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained, it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well, just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this, meanwhile, they all give stuff away, and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them, it's hard to argue with the quality of this, even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi, intense scenes, James Cameron, the others who made this, and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10",theres reason this is so appreciated,let it be said right away there is at least one obvious issue with this that doesnt have include fact that this is one those sequels that are so much like original that one could argue that its partially remake what im referring is that going by first it technically shouldnt exist i am not aware anyone who considers predecessor this be only film this series ive experienced many who with good cause deny there be third movie heck i am one them but i could see why there could be however if you look past that you ought at least consider doing so as this doesnt come off as one those follow ups released cash earlier success youre undeniably enjoyable well done cinematic experience plot is interesting well told pacing is solid acting is great all patrick is incredible addition neither arnie nor linda have forgotten how portray their role action gets bigger still consists fights shootouts car chases all which are marvelous exciting never degenerates into stupidity guns are still impeccably well chosen handled really cool new concept or two herein are very smart well thought out science fiction remains well done this holds appropriate amount volume self irony over title character though i did not mind seriousness previous silver screen effort while some dark tone is maintained it is less violent disturbing than 1984 piece there is also no nudity well just about or sexuality this i have more points against this meanwhile they all give stuff away this will remain spoiler free review even with them its hard argue with quality this even if you prefer terminator it i do i recommend this any fan sci fi intense scenes james cameron others who made this or food thought wrapped neatly celluloid 10 10,0.5007623857623859,0.15723665223665223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.18}"

9,King of the Action Flicks?,"Most action movies follow a pretty predictable sequence. There's nothing written in stone, but the movie tends to have an introduction, an epic conclusion, and then fills the intervening hour or two carefully switching between scenes of suspense, heroics, setbacks, triumphs, evil ploys and noble sacrifices. The more you watch, the more you notice the formula.Terminator 2 is one of the few good action movies that dares to throw the formula out the window, and that is what makes it so great. Instead of structuring the plot to build suspense by the book, Terminator 2 makes the bold move of telling a linear story where every scene actually has to be multi-dimensional and build the plot in a creative and new way. This is very hard to do, each scene practically has to be written from scratch like a chapter of a good book, and the difficulty of making that style of film-making succeed is why so many films rely on the trusty old formula.The structuring of Terminator 2 is a subtle thing to notice, but I do think it contributed to its success, and certainly to the relatively serious respect its given as a film. No one is going to confuse it with an art house film, of course, but at the same time, it does something that formula thrillers like ""Air Force One"" don't even try to do, it tells a story in an original, genuinely creative way without relying on traditional suspense-building clichés. In its own way, this film is a work of art.Of course, the film has much more obvious assets. The film's calling card will always be the epic action and special effects sequences - Arnold riding his bike off a ledge, twirling his shotgun around to reload it, tearing aside his fake skin to reveal the metal parts below - ""Terminator 2"" was a stunningly exciting film when it came out, and its visuals don't feel dated at all even 18 years later.Still, though, a lot of other films have had competent special effects. Why do people consider T2 a classic instead of films like ""Independence Day"", which also invested heavily in effects? It's not enough to just generate 15 minutes of jaw-dropping visuals in a 2 hour movie. You need to be creative about what you're actually depicting. A $10 million scene that's carefully crafted into the film's narrative is always going to do more for the audience than a similarly expensive scene that doesn't bother to give the audience any real reason to care about what's happening. Terminator 2 is a movie where the director spends time on the non-action scenes, treating them as more than just filler, and this really pays off because instead of seeing a nifty visual sequence with some character you don't particularly care about, the excitement of the action scenes in Terminator 2 is actually enhanced greatly because you like the good guys on a deeper level than in a formulaic action film.T2 is one of the high watermarks of action films. Everyone should see it, it's that simple.",king action flicks,most action movies follow pretty predictable sequence theres nothing written stone but movie tends have introduction epic conclusion then fills intervening hour or two carefully switching between scenes suspense heroics setbacks triumphs evil ploys noble sacrifices more you watch more you notice formula terminator 2 is one few good action movies that dares throw formula out window that is what makes it so great instead structuring plot build suspense by book terminator 2 makes bold move telling linear story where every scene actually has be multi dimensional build plot creative new way this is very hard do each scene practically has be written scratch like chapter good book difficulty making that style film making succeed is why so many films rely trusty old formula structuring terminator 2 is subtle thing notice but i do think it contributed its success certainly relatively serious respect its given as film no one is going confuse it with art house film course but at same time it does something that formula thrillers like air force one dont even try do it tells story original genuinely creative way without relying traditional suspense building clich s its own way this film is work art course film has much more obvious assets films calling card will always be epic action special effects sequences arnold riding his bike off ledge twirling his shotgun around reload it tearing aside his fake skin reveal metal parts below terminator 2 was stunningly exciting film when it came out its visuals dont feel dated at all even 18 years later still though lot other films have had competent special effects why do people consider t2 classic instead films like independence day which also invested heavily effects its not enough just generate 15 minutes jaw dropping visuals 2 hour movie you need be creative about what youre actually depicting 10 million scene thats carefully crafted into films narrative is always going do more audience than similarly expensive scene that doesnt bother give audience any real reason care about whats happening terminator 2 is movie where director spends time non action scenes treating them as more than just filler this really pays off because instead seeing nifty visual sequence with some character you dont particularly care about excitement action scenes terminator 2 is actually enhanced greatly because you like good guys deeper level than formulaic action film t2 is one high watermarks action films everyone should see it its that simple,0.4784417249417251,0.1666381951381951,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.43}"
