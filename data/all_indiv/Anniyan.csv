The film is so good that I would surely buy the DVD of the movie if I get a chance. The film is a clean entertainer with several messages for the society.It's the first movie of Vikram that I have seen. He is just amazing! The fights,music, dialogues, story and screenplay are awesome. The way Aparichit punishes the wrong doers is simply marvellous! Aparichit(Anniyan) is like a superhero that has come to save us. The conversion of Tamil titles in Hindi throughout the entire movie needs to be appreciated.

8.0,complete surprise,My experiences with Bollywood movies are quite good. Although I only watched the ones that had a higher rating. So it's normal that they are good.This movie is somewhat different from the other movies I've watched. Those were more comedy's. This movie also his a comedy side. But it's much more than that. It's much more complex than a comedy. The other personality's from Ambi are very interesting. Anniyan and Remo. Anniyan is his dark side and Remo his romantic side. I won't tell you any more. Because if you like to see something different from India watch this.Good luck with finding it! I'm lucky I had the opportunity to watch this movie.,complete surprise,my experiences with bollywood movies are quite good although i only watched ones that had higher rating so its normal that they are good this movie is somewhat different other movies ive watched those were more comedys this movie also his comedy side but its much more than that its much more complex than comedy other personalitys ambi are very interesting anniyan remo anniyan is his dark side remo his romantic side i wont tell you any more because if you like see something different india watch this good luck with finding it im lucky i had opportunity watch this movie,0.5541666666666667,0.24416666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.42, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.16}"

10.0,Anniyan is what every movie wants to be: An entertainer,"Shankar and Vikram have done a fantastic job. Director Shankar is turning into a professional high-quality perfectionist. Actor Vikram, charged with a National award for Best Actor (2004) is on a roll. His performance is classy and comparable to many great actors of Tamil cinema.Anniyan is definitely worth watching at least once. Forget about the critics who list past movies from which various aspects of Anniyan (like concept, theme, stunts, music) was inspired (or copied). It is easier to make the original than to make a copy as the original serves as a hard benchmark. It is hard to replicate something while maintaining audience interest. Shankar does this job to a more-than-satisfying extent.Besides, when great directors like Steven Spielberg copy past movies (War of the worlds) with the confidence of providing the viewers something worthwhile to watch, I don't see anything wrong in Shankar's Anniyan. Yet, Anniyan is NOT a complete copy and it is definitely MORE than the sum of its parts.Anniyan has stunts that were never before seen in any Tamil movie. Shankar has provided the opportunity to the (uneducated mass of) Tamil audience of watching world-class stunts in a movie that they can understand (as against most Hollywood flicks that have the action but make no sense to them). So what, if it has been copied? Matrix Reloaded being largely mystifying and unexplained, even to most native-English speakers, could not justify to the (masses of the) Tamil audience as to why all the action exists!!??. But that is not the case with Anniyan.To sum it all up, Anniyan is what a movie should really be. A classy entertainer. Good songs, great cinematography, wonderful (although sometimes unbelievable) stunts, great acting performance, nice comedy and classic direction. Watch the movie without prejudice and be entertained.",anniyan is what every movie wants be entertainer,shankar vikram have done fantastic job director shankar is turning into professional high quality perfectionist actor vikram charged with national award best actor 2004 is roll his performance is classy comparable many great actors tamil cinema anniyan is definitely worth watching at least once forget about critics who list past movies which various aspects anniyan like concept theme stunts music was inspired or copied it is easier make original than make copy as original serves as hard benchmark it is hard replicate something while maintaining audience interest shankar does this job more than satisfying extent besides when great directors like steven spielberg copy past movies war worlds with confidence providing viewers something worthwhile watch i dont see anything wrong shankars anniyan yet anniyan is not complete copy it is definitely more than sum its parts anniyan has stunts that were never before seen any tamil movie shankar has provided opportunity uneducated mass tamil audience watching world class stunts movie that they can understand as against most hollywood flicks that have action but make no sense them so what if it has been copied matrix reloaded being largely mystifying unexplained even most native english speakers could not justify masses tamil audience as why all action exists but that is not case with anniyan sum it all up anniyan is what movie should really be classy entertainer good songs great cinematography wonderful although sometimes unbelievable stunts great acting performance nice comedy classic direction watch movie without prejudice be entertained,0.5129642857142858,0.26144047619047617,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7.0,Could have been way better,"Unlike my friends, I was awaiting Aparichit (Hindi Version) eagerly as it was a Shankar film and I like his movie a lot. To start off with, Aparichit is a good film, but at the same time it suffers from a lot of plot holes. The writer should have gone through his script before starting the shoot. I mean according to the movie, Ambi (Vikkram) is a character who suffers from multiple personality disorders but if that's the case, can Mr. Shankar explain how in the blue hell does he get all his powers from? He flies, He fights like Neo, and survives after being frozen! Its way too unrealistic. The script would have been justified if Shankar showed the concept of something supernatural out here.Sada's acting is natural and Vikkram's performance, although good, has been overrated. His portrayal of Ambi and Aparichit are good but his Remo is absolutely pathetic. The movies has some really funny moments. the south Indian flavor of the film starts getting onto your nerves too much at times. The scene where Ambi's sister dies was pathetic. Music is a let down with only ""Gora Gora Aankh"" standing out and Remo should have been of shorter length. The other songs are terrible.Oh did I tell you Remo can remove and fix back house roofs in less than 2-3 seconds? The plot was really good but the movie got screwed because of the writer.Shankar got too carried away and made an unrealistic movie. The website and e-mail part was another trauma.The action, although highly inspired by The Matrix Reloaded, is still original. Aparichit's way of punishing the wrong doers is a plus point for the movie and so is the ending. Even though the movie isn't a masterpiece, its still different from the usual flicks that we get and I'd advice that you go and watch this film. If I ever become a director in life, i'd love to remake this movie with a more realistic out look.",could have been way better,unlike my friends i was awaiting aparichit hindi version eagerly as it was shankar film i like his movie lot start off with aparichit is good film but at same time it suffers lot plot holes writer should have gone through his script before starting shoot i mean according movie ambi vikkram is character who suffers multiple personality disorders but if thats case can mr shankar explain how blue hell does he get all his powers he flies he fights like neo survives after being frozen its way too unrealistic script would have been justified if shankar showed concept something supernatural out here sadas acting is natural vikkrams performance although good has been overrated his portrayal ambi aparichit are good but his remo is absolutely pathetic movies has some really funny moments south indian flavor film starts getting onto your nerves too much at times scene where ambis sister dies was pathetic music is let down with only gora gora aankh standing out remo should have been shorter length other songs are terrible oh did i tell you remo can remove fix back house roofs less than 2 3 seconds plot was really good but movie got screwed because writer shankar got too carried away made unrealistic movie website e mail part was another trauma action although highly inspired by matrix reloaded is still original aparichits way punishing wrong doers is plus point movie so is ending even though movie isnt masterpiece its still different usual flicks that we get id advice that you go watch this film if i ever become director life id love remake this movie with more realistic out look,0.5319744744744743,-0.013280780780780783,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"
7.0,What do you get when you mix a bit of Indian and Mudhalvan?,"To begin with Shankar's movie can be a instant mega impressive or not but might still be worth watching with the time, later as time evolves, the movie would become unwatchable. With some many good reviews for this, I decided to watch the first day first show with an idea if the movie was not so good either, I could always go for new skillful actor Vikram, I wasn't disappointed with the movie but saw little similarities with Shankar's previous movies Indian, Mudhalvan. The story is no different, he tries to convey his dream of having India a super better place to live. Without giving out too much about movie, it is real hard to review this movie but to say worth watching. The story begins with a central character Ramanujam aka Ambi aka Rules Ramanujam owing to his ability to do everything by rules and regulations, a real hard to see honest lawyer which is ironic due to the fact that all lawyers everywhere are considered ""scum bags"". Ramanujam is honest but likes a girl from his childhood but is too scared to say it out and has been locking his feelings, suppression causes ""Remo"" to come out and romance for few out of sequence songs. O boy did that song remind me of ""Azhagana Rakshisi from Mudhalvan"". Well while this goes on, Anniyan comes out to prevent the wrong doings happening in the country. Who is Anniyan, Remo, Ramanujam, watching the movie will only tell. Please have a open mind to watch the movie, don't go by anyone's opinion as you will never know? Enjoy Aniyan while cherishing acting of Vikram and Prakash Raj. Comedy by Vivek as usual rocks.

7.0,Long but good...read at your risk...,"One of the best Indian thrillers yet, Aparichitudu succeeds not only in grabbing the audience's attention, but in keeping us thinking as well. It's about a judicious man, Ramu who is fussy about everyone following rules and happens to be the only person noticing the injustice in his corrupt society. No doubt, he is very well educated , disciplined and religious. However, his qualifications and marriage applications (classic) are not enough to pursue Nandini, his love interest who I find terribly non-empathetic. That's right, a man who really cares for her does not seem to impress her. Due to frustration and Nandini's spiteful words, he almost drowns himself. But that's not the end. Another personality, the flamboyant and hip Remo springs into picture and we see Ramu undergo a complete makeover. He blows Nandu's breathe away with his ""hot"" highlights and ""smooth moves"". Thankfully, he is not the most catchy and unique thing in this movie. These were the times when I literally wanted to leave the theatre, not that the movie was getting nowhere, but Ramu was being severely tortured by a gang of hunks, and Nandini doesn't take his advice, things are going, well, horriblyUp to the rescue is the amazing but scary personality of Aparichitudu with his hair creepily in front of his face, punishing all those people who did wrong to him and who broke the rules of society, following the way- too dangerous contents of the Garudapuranam and leaving hints behind. Although his ways are ethically questionable, Aparichitudu's personality is the heart of this film. But will Ramu's multi-personality disorder crises be discovered? If so, how does he get cured? How and where did Aparichitudu come from? Under what circumstances will he leave the citizens alone? What happens when Nandini finds out? All these questions are answered in this twisting movie.",long but good read at your risk,one best indian thrillers yet aparichitudu succeeds not only grabbing audiences attention but keeping us thinking as well its about judicious man ramu who is fussy about everyone following rules happens be only person noticing injustice his corrupt society no doubt he is very well educated disciplined religious however his qualifications marriage applications classic are not enough pursue nandini his love interest who i find terribly non empathetic thats right man who really cares her does not seem impress her due frustration nandinis spiteful words he almost drowns himself but thats not end another personality flamboyant hip remo springs into picture we see ramu undergo complete makeover he blows nandus breathe away with his hot highlights smooth moves thankfully he is not most catchy unique thing this movie these were times when i literally wanted leave theatre not that movie was getting nowhere but ramu was being severely tortured by gang hunks nandini doesnt take his advice things are going well horribly up rescue is amazing but scary personality aparichitudu with his hair creepily front his face punishing all those people who did wrong him who broke rules society following way too dangerous contents garudapuranam leaving hints behind although his ways are ethically questionable aparichitudus personality is heart this film but will ramus multi personality disorder crises be discovered if so how does he get cured how where did aparichitudu come under what circumstances will he leave citizens alone what happens when nandini finds out all these questions are answered this twisting movie,0.6186251920122887,-0.014439324116743478,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10.0,Must watch film,"Exotic visuals, breathtaking action scenes and well choreographed songs are the hallmark of Shankar and he does not disappoint you in Anniyan. Combined with Vikram's brilliant portrayal of various roles Anniyan in one word is 'Amazing'. Though Anniyan resembles Shankar's earlier films Indian and Muthalvan, it's the narration which makes all the difference.Ramanujam alias Ambi (Vikram) is called as Rules Ramanujam as he goes by the rule book. A lawyer by profession, he reacts to people who break the rules like disobeying traffic rules, not helping people in distress, eve-teasing in transport buses, spitting on roads, not providing standard meals in trains and so on. His good intentions and proper approach do not take him anywhere. He is a stickler for rules and that does not always work.His father Parthasarathy (Nedumudi Venu) keeps advising him that single handedly he cannot change the world. He gets shattered when he realizes that his childhood friend and now a medical student Nandhini (Sada) refuses his love.He comes across a website anniyan.com which follows the Garudapuranam, the Hindu folklore which is similar to the Christian judgment which reveals that those who commit misdeeds will be punished in hell according to the degree of their deeds. And Ambi takes the avatar of Anniyan. He kick starts a process through which he starts punishing the wicked people on earth. In the meantime, there is another character Remo, a ravishing supermodel who tries to cajole Nandhini, and she falls head over heels in love with him. Remo is none other than Ambi.One day on seeing Nandhini cheating the income tax people Ambi transforms to Anniyan and chases her to kill her. Nandhini realizing something wrong with Ambi take him to a psychiatrist, who discovers that Ambi suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). In a split second, Ambi transforms into Anniyan and then to Remo much to the surprise of the doctors and Nandhini. In a flashback, it is revealed why Ambi suffers from MPD. Amidst all this drama, an untiring policeman Prabhakar (Prakash Raj) gets down to track all the killings and the mystery behind them. Whether the police manage to nail Ambi forms the thrilling climax.Vikram has three dimensions to his role. He easily slips into all three characters. Anniyan is definitely a feather in the cap of Vikram. Sada is passable. She excels only in the glamorous songs but acting wise has a long way to go. Nedumudi Venu as the hero's father does a good job. Vivek's comedy does raise a few laughs. Prakashraj is the scene stealer and matches up to Vikram.Manikandan and Ravi Verman combo gives a visual treat. The Nokia song is the best of the lot. Harris Jayaraj music with the visuals gives a stunning effect. Shankar who dealt with major issues like corruption in education and public life and exposed the lack of political will to govern, has in Anniyan stressed on the need for civic discipline and accountability by the public. 'If three crore citizens steal five paisa each then is it not a big crime?' is the question posed by the director. He drives home the point that many things that we come across in day to day life and just ignore can be set right if one stands up against them. From the yellow line violation to the manufacturer who makes substandard brake cables, all are equally responsible for the country going to the dogs. The split personality funda attracts more than a few people because of its uniqueness and queer nature.Peter Heyen's action sequences are well choreographed and the fight in which Anniyan takes on the kungfu exponents is a treat to watch.Anniyan is an out and out family entertainer.",must watch film,exotic visuals breathtaking action scenes well choreographed songs are hallmark shankar he does not disappoint you anniyan combined with vikrams brilliant portrayal various roles anniyan one word is amazing though anniyan resembles shankars earlier films indian muthalvan its narration which makes all difference ramanujam alias ambi vikram is called as rules ramanujam as he goes by rule book lawyer by profession he reacts people who break rules like disobeying traffic rules not helping people distress eve teasing transport buses spitting roads not providing standard meals trains so his good intentions proper approach do not take him anywhere he is stickler rules that does not always work his father parthasarathy nedumudi venu keeps advising him that single handedly he cannot change world he gets shattered when he realizes that his childhood friend now medical student nandhini sada refuses his love he comes across website anniyan com which follows garudapuranam hindu folklore which is similar christian judgment which reveals that those who commit misdeeds will be punished hell according degree their deeds ambi takes avatar anniyan he kick starts process through which he starts punishing wicked people earth meantime there is another character remo ravishing supermodel who tries cajole nandhini she falls head over heels love with him remo is none other than ambi one day seeing nandhini cheating income tax people ambi transforms anniyan chases her kill her nandhini realizing something wrong with ambi take him psychiatrist who discovers that ambi suffers multiple personality disorder mpd split second ambi transforms into anniyan then remo much surprise doctors nandhini flashback it is revealed why ambi suffers mpd amidst all this drama untiring policeman prabhakar prakash raj gets down track all killings mystery behind them whether police manage nail ambi forms thrilling climax vikram has three dimensions his role he easily slips into all three characters anniyan is definitely feather cap vikram sada is passable she excels only glamorous songs but acting wise has long way go nedumudi venu as heros father does good job viveks comedy does raise few laughs prakashraj is scene stealer matches up vikram manikandan ravi verman combo gives visual treat nokia song is best lot harris jayaraj music with visuals gives stunning effect shankar who dealt with major issues like corruption education public life exposed lack political will govern has anniyan stressed need civic discipline accountability by public if three crore citizens steal five paisa each then is it not big crime is question posed by director he drives home point that many things that we come across day day life just ignore can be set right if one stands up against them yellow line violation manufacturer who makes substandard brake cables all are equally responsible country going dogs split personality funda attracts more than few people because its uniqueness queer nature peter heyens action sequences are well choreographed fight which anniyan takes kungfu exponents is treat watch anniyan is out out family entertainer,0.4306111111111112,0.14459126984126983,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"
8.0,sarva dharmath parithyajyam...........,"Ahhhh..... these were the times. I remember the day when my friend and I went for the matinée to watch this movie on the first week of its release in Kerala. I was 14 back then and had no reputed history of watching Tamil movies or any knowledge about the director's previous works what so ever, other than boys (I knew Vikram from some of his Malayalam movies though). And there it was one of a rare gift you can give to a teenage boy who was obsessed with pop culture, action and thrillers. I was blown away at the end of the movie; I got the thrill ride which I only used to expect from a Hollywood movie. The movie has it all....it's a psychological thriller; it's got action, comedy, romance, and the usual Tamil masala ingredients that all other Indian movies are trying so desperately to capture, nowadays. This was the movie that got me interested to Tamil movies.Before watching this movie I had no idea about personality disorders, so it was more like me asking myself.. (Before the interval) 'What's going on?? Are there 3 people?? Does he have super powers?? Is he the villain?? Maybe they're twins or triplets'. Vikram did a well commendable work in this movie. The character shifts, the way the body language and the speech patterns changes were all a great performance. The way Shankar portrayed Anniyan as the Hindu version of a mass murdering, ass kicking, Grim reaper was a spectacle; the way he fights others with tremendous strength and speed made me think... what the hell are they dealing with over there?? While the other two personalities showed more vulnerability to violence. I would say that this movie did something new by not having a villain and showing Anniyan with all the characteristics of a scary villain (first thing i noticed was the hairstyle from 'the ring') and making him as mass murdering social hero which was something new at that time.....for me at least. I would say Anniyan is one of a kind and a worth a must watch.",sarva dharmath parithyajyam,ahhhh these were times i remember day when my friend i went matin e watch this movie first week its release kerala i was 14 back then had no reputed history watching tamil movies or any knowledge about directors previous works what so ever other than boys i knew vikram some his malayalam movies though there it was one rare gift you can give teenage boy who was obsessed with pop culture action thrillers i was blown away at end movie i got thrill ride which i only used expect hollywood movie movie has it all its psychological thriller its got action comedy romance usual tamil masala ingredients that all other indian movies are trying so desperately capture nowadays this was movie that got me interested tamil movies before watching this movie i had no idea about personality disorders so it was more like me asking myself before interval whats going are there 3 people does he have super powers is he villain maybe theyre twins or triplets vikram did well commendable work this movie character shifts way body language speech patterns changes were all great performance way shankar portrayed anniyan as hindu version mass murdering ass kicking grim reaper was spectacle way he fights others with tremendous strength speed made me think what hell are they dealing with over there while other two personalities showed more vulnerability violence i would say that this movie did something new by not having villain showing anniyan with all characteristics scary villain first thing i noticed was hairstyle ring making him as mass murdering social hero which was something new at that time me at least i would say anniyan is one kind worth must watch,0.4900252525252526,0.04103535353535353,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,"Well made film, with obvious flaws","I recently saw this film dubbed in Hindi, the movie's name was changed to Aparichit. A great film which involves multi personality disorder, and a message to the common Indian public which rings true.the film has some obvious logic flaws such a REMO's hair being streaked and the others don't reflect that change! also many people complained that the heroine is too thin! I for one am unable to understand the southindians obsession with the Fat heroine's! Sada was good in the role, not just cardboard cut out, also her figure is great.We then come to Viikram's acting, he has done a Excellent job at it, portraying 3 different people is a challenge for any actor, and the change can be seen in the person's face.The message Aprichit (anniyan) passed on to the public about people not caring for the rules is a profound message and really made me think, that he does have a point! all in all the a enjoyable film ,with some good scenes, some flaws and important message to deliver.",well made film with obvious flaws,i recently saw this film dubbed hindi movies name was changed aparichit great film which involves multi personality disorder message common indian public which rings true film has some obvious logic flaws such remos hair being streaked others dont reflect that change also many people complained that heroine is too thin i one am unable understand southindians obsession with fat heroines sada was good role not just cardboard cut out also her figure is great we then come viikrams acting he has done excellent job at it portraying 3 different people is challenge any actor change can be seen persons face message aprichit anniyan passed public about people not caring rules is profound message really made me think that he does have point all all enjoyable film with some good scenes some flaws important message deliver,0.5297101449275362,0.19710144927536236,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.25}"
,An insult to the movie industry,"I can't believe I'm writing a review for a movie this bad. I know better than to expect good movies from the Tamil film industry these days, but this one came as a shocker nevertheless. I don't remember the last half-decent movie I saw that came from home - probably Autograph. It's a shame: the same industry that produced Kadhalikka Neramillai, Nayagan, Mouna Ragam...but I digress. What hurts me most is hypocrisy in such *message* movies. I will eat the humble pie if anything changes in India after Shankar makes a million of these movies a million times over. Anniyan was just a fool-proof formula masquerading as a film that had a social message. Try telling someone else that Shankar cares about anything except for the commercial success of his movies. And for heaven's sake, why can't we be original? There's one very interesting forum topic here that's discussing the number of English movies this was a rip-off from. I'm sure the quiz-masters are getting their notepads ready for a mega question: play a couple of scenes and then ask the contestants to name all the original movies that 'inspired' those scenes. Don't even let me get started on the song lyrics... Now that I've berated it enough, let me explain why I gave it the three stars that I did. Song visualisations. Vivek's comedy (a *big* saving grace - 2 stars). I'm not going to ask you not to watch it. You are either going to think I'm stupid, or that I watch only Bergman, Fellini, Renoir and Eisenstein to be saying such ridiculous things. So, go ahead by all means. And God bless our country if such movies are going to change it.",insult movie industry,i cant believe im writing review movie this bad i know better than expect good movies tamil film industry these days but this one came as shocker nevertheless i dont remember last half decent movie i saw that came home probably autograph its shame same industry that produced kadhalikka neramillai nayagan mouna ragam but i digress what hurts me most is hypocrisy such message movies i will eat humble pie if anything changes india after shankar makes million these movies million times over anniyan was just fool proof formula masquerading as film that had social message try telling someone else that shankar cares about anything except commercial success his movies heavens sake why cant we be original theres one very interesting forum topic here thats discussing number english movies this was rip off im sure quiz masters are getting their notepads ready mega question play couple scenes then ask contestants name all original movies that inspired those scenes dont even let me get started song lyrics now that ive berated it enough let me explain why i gave it three stars that i did song visualisations viveks comedy big saving grace 2 stars im not going ask you not watch it you are either going think im stupid or that i watch only bergman fellini renoir eisenstein be saying such ridiculous things so go ahead by all means god bless our country if such movies are going change it,0.4768162393162393,0.08076923076923077,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"

7.0,Don't expect anything outstanding and enjoy this Indian clone,"One of the biggest flaws in this movie concerns the same thing that Shankar actually got right during Boys. In Boys, 99% of the characters were new entrants and unknowns and were thus were very realistic and highly effective in their roles. However, in Anniyan, every villain, every common bad guy and every misc character were played by big leaguers who would have been familiar for the zillionth time. A coupla comedians play bad guys and are extremely ineffective in that role and difficult to take seriously. Thus the elements of shock normally present in a Shankar flick do not exist in Anniyan. The second biggest flaw is the overuse of really bad CGI, cheap gimmickry and too many references to the internet. Third, too many movies have been copied and the remakes of the scenes look utterly stupid. This movie has obviously been formulated and engineered to rake in money at the box office without actually offering anything amazing or worthy.",dont expect anything outstanding enjoy this indian clone,one biggest flaws this movie concerns same thing that shankar actually got right during boys boys 99 characters were new entrants unknowns were thus were very realistic highly effective their roles however anniyan every villain every common bad guy every misc character were played by big leaguers who would have been familiar zillionth time coupla comedians play bad guys are extremely ineffective that role difficult take seriously thus elements shock normally present shankar flick do not exist anniyan second biggest flaw is overuse really bad cgi cheap gimmickry too many references internet third too many movies have been copied remakes scenes look utterly stupid this movie has obviously been formulated engineered rake money at box office without actually offering anything amazing or worthy,0.5282235621521335,0.024598021026592483,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9.0,Shankar's yet another chiller,"Shankar is my favorite film maker. His movies have speed, tightly woven script. His movies are frame by frame perfect. He hits at corrupt system hard with varying backdrops. This one too hits at system. But the treatment is diff from all his other movies. Acting is extremely good. Sharp camera work which is the trademark of Shankar is terrific in this movie too. I am not in the habit of disclosing story in my reviews. So I would say that story is very different and is not quite common. Movie has some very light resemblance to his own old creation Hindustani(Kamal Hasan) where he uses some old Indian traditional art to tackle corruption. In this movie too he uses some thing which is part of very old Indian culture. Movie has suspense which keeps audience at the edge of their seats.Thank you Shankar for these movies.

5.0,Shankar's worst movie,"What a terrible disappointment this movie was. Shankar was pathetic in trying to churn out a mediocre entertainer to fill his pocket rather than go with the type of new and graphically controvertial ideas that come into mind which make his movies so exclusive. Heres where Anniyan fails,Plot - Essentially a repeat of Indian and Mudhalvan and not as good as either by far. This time around, the people get blamed for their behavior in society. When you think about it, it did a little bit of potential and the movie could have been a bit more violent and used some better ideas devoid of clichés. All the familiar stories show up.Acting - The worst ever. The bad deeds done by society are all unconvincing, look intentional for the camera and are done by too many familiar actors who you simply can't picture playing such roles. Vikram's acting is highly overrated and utterly stupid as that Remo character. In all of Shankar's movies, the acting was super realistic to the extent that it shocked you. Not here. It was lame. Prakash Raj just plays himself and is an unconvincing police officer.Action - Horrid, comical style fight scenes with a 3rd rate repeat of matrix and kill bill fight scenes with 1/50th the budget. The stunt and camera guys really ripped Shankar off.Comedy - Very good. Vivek keeps the movie going. Some other characters also deliver good comedy. Songs - No AR Rehman. Nuff said.Special effects - Why do stupid 3D Graphics and CGI done by the worst ever teams keep showing up? They have no point whatsoever. They are embarrassing. Did Shankar really think that the audience was dumb enough to buy that Anniyan 3D animated an entire world using only Macromedia Flash?If you look at Boys, you can see that Shankar really wanted to make his movies as graphic and realistic as possible. This movie is neither. It tries to be and look violent but poor screenplay and poor cinematography ruin it.
