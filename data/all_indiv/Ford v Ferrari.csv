9.0,Entertaining In Every Way A Film Can Be,"I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of ""big corporation screwing over the little guy"" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to ""Ford v Ferrari"". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present.",entertaining every way film can be,ive never watched car race my life i have absolutely no knowledge historic events surrounding ford ferrari motor companies none those two things mattered my viewing experience ford v ferrari not only does it allow viewer be complete clean slate but it provides utmost entertainment almost every front very basic overview this movie tells story how ford motor company was struggling 1960s thus turned racing cars give their image boost problem years ferrari has been gold standard that theater but with carroll shelby matt damon overseeing project volatile ken miles christian bale drivers seat they set out take down ferrari at 1966 24 hours le mans race one main strengths ford v ferrari is that it tells bunch different stories within basic framework not only is it clash that title anticipates but also story personal redemption shelby one personal goal achievement miles even healthy dose big corporation screwing over little guy thrown all those angles are very distinct with nothing muddled along way 2 5 hour runtime really helps with this allowing such arcs play out their entirety acting is also incredible basically entire cast bale gives unique quirky performance as seemingly only he can damon is solid as always everyone else does their part admirably especially affecting are miles wife mollie caitriona balfe son peter noah jupe who both provide much sentimental emotions present film specific scene where ken explains peter exactly what he does each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets theres also never ending sense forward momentum just overall fun ford v ferrari it never takes itself too seriously yet it isnt comedy its long but doesnt feel that way due expert pacing perfect balance pulse pounding action scenes slower more emotional scenes within understated 1960s period feel director james mangold probably deserves good amount credit making this all congeal together as well as it did overall this is spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences so many different ways whether through action emotion true story or underlying themes most viewers will be able find something enjoy here even if like i said before no previously knowledge racing is present,0.4547975517890772,0.15729284369114874,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.53}"

9.0,Filled with Energy,"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases.",filled with energy,biopics can be hard sell at times whether youre diving into troubled life addict or exploring someones sexuality there are many touchy subjects these days with that said i feel there are also those that will stand test time terms being able please wide audience ford v ferrari is one latest true stories out hollywood that will be hitting big screen soon heres why i believe it absolutely deserves attention following multiple characters throughout ford v ferrari focussed fact that henry ford ii was given idea create fastest race car world his mission is take down likes company ferrari who have held title years carol shelby matt damon is approached by member ford team is recruited only be one finding himself recruiting driver ken miles christian bale thats core premise theres lot dive into there if youre fan racing or cars general this movie will be you this is very well directed film by james mangold racing sequences are quite long taking up good chunk nearly 150 minute run time luckily they are very intense practically shot with fantastic score back it up sound effects get your heart pumping everything about exciting aspects this film was top notch christian bale matt damon give stellar performances here as two leading men film i totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed sadly without giving anything away there is incident that i feel was not explored enough which slightly took away when certain moment is meant impact movie other than that this is fantastic movie beginning end end ford v ferrari is engaging emotional downright thrilling when it wants be i was invested these characters edge my seat during climactic races i thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie there is missed opportunity terms emotion during certain scene but i was able forgive that seeing as rest movie was so impressive ford v ferrari is one best movies ive seen so far this year it will be one see when it officially releases,0.5531577169875044,0.19006416751097605,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,Best Race Car Movie Ever?,"Gut level racing movie with no need to manufacture fictional drama - Fact takes over the drama throughout Ford v Ferrari and it is glorious on-the-edge engagement fueled by the Hi-Test performances of the two stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale.Being a former SCCA racer (in my 20's), my bucket list need for speed took me to the track to live out my childhood dream of racing cars, and I did an admirable job at winning races at one of the lowest levels possible in racing - but it was always about being the best that I knew I could be (and could afford as car racing gets very expensive as you move up to the higher performance level cars), which as it turns out was better than anyone else at that level.Hill took that to the top production and competition levels (financed by manufacturers, and those independents with extremely deep pockets), illustrating the universal need of racers to validate their abilities, which is magnified 100-fold at the professional level.This is a great film as filmmaking goes, whether one is a race fan or a movie fan, and deserved its nominations and awards. Best race car movie of all time?? X marks the spot, and that is 'Ford v Ferrari'.

8.0,"""We're gonna build a race car.""","You don't have to be a race car enthusiast to enjoy this film. I'm certainly not, having neither the desire or the patience to watch daring motor cars race around a track at mind boggling speeds. Though you do have to credit the drivers who enjoy the profession; it takes a certain amount of bravura and stamina to withstand the pace and stress forces that go with the territory. Without knowing the story in advance, I thought it was going to pit Matt Damon against Christian Bale as opposing drivers, but that idea was quickly put to rest. The legendary Carroll Shelby (Damon) is in the spotlight here as the former racer and design engineer recruited by the Ford Motor Company to build a championship vehicle. In no small measure was it Ford's response to a snub by Italian car maker, Enzo Ferrari, who turned down a merger with the American company in a fit of pique. Had he gone along, the end result in the picture may never have occurred.The movie will call to mind the Steve McQueen race car epic ""Le Mans"" from 1971. With a half century separating the two films, both reliably capture the spirit and flavor of the world's longest endurance test. ""Le Mans"" has more of a documentary type feel than the movie under consideration here, with less of a plot and straightforward story line. Building up to the seminal race in 1966 featured in this film, the story takes an introspective look at the machinations of the Ford Motor Company to control all aspects of engineering a vehicle they hope to defeat the Italians with. Not to mention the politics and marketing aspect of selecting a driver who wouldn't embarrass the company by going public with any developmental problems along the way.For fans and non-fans alike, the racing scenes are thrilling and adrenaline inducing. As driver Ken Mills, Christian Bale exudes nerves of steel and a soaring passion to be the best driver out there, achieving mind boggling speeds that would otherwise strike fear in the hearts of most mortal men. That was comically illustrated in the one scene in which Shelby himself took Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) for a 'spin' in a car under development. If there's any sense of a let down with the picture, it would have to be the screw job Mills suffered when he agreed to bring in all three of Ford's race cars to the finish line together at Le Mans. Realizing it, Mills bore the slight with dignity, knowing in his heart that he was the best driver out there that day, and nothing could take that away from him.",were gonna build race car,you dont have be race car enthusiast enjoy this film im certainly not having neither desire or patience watch daring motor cars race around track at mind boggling speeds though you do have credit drivers who enjoy profession it takes certain amount bravura stamina withstand pace stress forces that go with territory without knowing story advance i thought it was going pit matt damon against christian bale as opposing drivers but that idea was quickly put rest legendary carroll shelby damon is spotlight here as former racer design engineer recruited by ford motor company build championship vehicle no small measure was it fords response snub by italian car maker enzo ferrari who turned down merger with american company fit pique had he gone along end result picture may never have occurred movie will call mind steve mcqueen race car epic le mans 1971 with half century separating two films both reliably capture spirit flavor worlds longest endurance test le mans has more documentary type feel than movie under consideration here with less plot straightforward story line building up seminal race 1966 featured this film story takes introspective look at machinations ford motor company control all aspects engineering vehicle they hope defeat italians with not mention politics marketing aspect selecting driver who wouldnt embarrass company by going public with any developmental problems along way fans non fans alike racing scenes are thrilling adrenaline inducing as driver ken mills christian bale exudes nerves steel soaring passion be best driver out there achieving mind boggling speeds that would otherwise strike fear hearts most mortal men that was comically illustrated one scene which shelby himself took henry ford ii tracy letts spin car under development if theres any sense let down with picture it would have be screw job mills suffered when he agreed bring all three fords race cars finish line together at le mans realizing it mills bore slight with dignity knowing his heart that he was best driver out there that day nothing could take that away him,0.3522250566893424,0.22069160997732423,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"

9.0,Rushing to the finish,"After being very behind with film watching and reviewing, a lot of my reviews this year being dedicated to individual episodes of shows, completest quests and some cartoons, finally made the decision to watch more films released this year and to finally review the films seen earlier this year but hadn't gotten round to seeing. 'Le Mans 66' was a very eagerly anticipated film, due to liking the lead actors and loving 'Rush' that this has been compared to by some, and one of the year's (quite hit and miss) more acclaimed films, so there was not any doubt about seeing it.'Le Mans 66' (often advertised though under the easier to remember title of 'Ford v Ferrari') doesn't disappoint a vast majority of the time, almost everything is right with it. Found it an exceptionally well made, acted, written and enthralling film and one of the year's must sees, also one of the few films this year where the advertising actually did it justice which is such a rarity in film (having lost count of the number of great films that were criminally mismarketed or misleadingly so). Seeing as 2019 has been another hit and miss year, with a fair share of good to brilliant films, a fair share of mediocre films or less (including clunkers) and films sitting in between, that is saying a fair bit actually and am not trying to sound like a snob here.It isn't without its flaws, though they are hardly any. Did find the character of Peter and his scenes rather too twee for my liking, like when the film cutaways to him where he pointlessly explains the action. 'Le Mans 66' already had a lot of emotional impact of all kinds, the character and his presence just didn't seem necessary.Maybe it is a little too long too, it could easily have done with being perhaps 15 minutes shorter and lessening or excising Peter's role would have made things better.However, 'Le Mans 66' looks great. Especially the editing, which is actually quite astonishing in the action-oriented scenes and can see some kind of nod for Best Editing at any of the big awards. Likewise with the sound editing, which is quite striking in its authenticity, 'Le Mans 66' capturing the spirit of the sport and the personal lives behind it beautifully. James Mangold's direction is stylish throughout, the action-oriented scenes have plenty of thrills and mostly the personal lives scenes are emotionally investable.Script is tightly structured and is nicely balanced. The story is always well balanced and some twee moments aside is always compelling. The climactic race is absolutely thrilling in every sense of the word. All the performances are spot on, with Matt Damon giving one of his better and most good-natured performances and Tracy Letts excels in his role, especially in his post-drive breakdown and his frankness during the Ford executive presentation. Best of all is Christian Bale in the film's most demanding role, he captures the uncomprimising attitude needed brilliantly.All in all, excellent and one of 2019's highlights when it comes to film. 9/10",rushing finish,after being very behind with film watching reviewing lot my reviews this year being dedicated individual episodes shows completest quests some cartoons finally made decision watch more films released this year finally review films seen earlier this year but hadnt gotten round seeing le mans 66 was very eagerly anticipated film due liking lead actors loving rush that this has been compared by some one years quite hit miss more acclaimed films so there was not any doubt about seeing it le mans 66 often advertised though under easier remember title ford v ferrari doesnt disappoint vast majority time almost everything is right with it found it exceptionally well made acted written enthralling film one years must sees also one few films this year where advertising actually did it justice which is such rarity film having lost count number great films that were criminally mismarketed or misleadingly so seeing as 2019 has been another hit miss year with fair share good brilliant films fair share mediocre films or less including clunkers films sitting between that is saying fair bit actually am not trying sound like snob here it isnt without its flaws though they are hardly any did find character peter his scenes rather too twee my liking like when film cutaways him where he pointlessly explains action le mans 66 already had lot emotional impact all kinds character his presence just didnt seem necessary maybe it is little too long too it could easily have done with being perhaps 15 minutes shorter lessening or excising peters role would have made things better however le mans 66 looks great especially editing which is actually quite astonishing action oriented scenes can see some kind nod best editing at any big awards likewise with sound editing which is quite striking its authenticity le mans 66 capturing spirit sport personal lives behind it beautifully james mangolds direction is stylish throughout action oriented scenes have plenty thrills mostly personal lives scenes are emotionally investable script is tightly structured is nicely balanced story is always well balanced some twee moments aside is always compelling climactic race is absolutely thrilling every sense word all performances are spot with matt damon giving one his better most good natured performances tracy letts excels his role especially his post drive breakdown his frankness during ford executive presentation best all is christian bale films most demanding role he captures uncomprimising attitude needed brilliantly all all excellent one 2019s highlights when it comes film 9 10,0.6007178393745558,0.25098969438521673,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"

8.0,"""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this.""","I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment.",i had no idea if only my dad were alive see this,ive seen lot car movies as self professed car nut as such i judge them harshly immediately dismiss entries that dont provide enough reason care about what is more important than car driver think fast furious transformers franchise if you care about driver driver cares about car you care about car car is tool extension heros body gains provenance with audience when it helps hero their personal journey movies that come mind that do this effectively include gone 60 seconds bullitt need speed italian job batman begins bourne identity some james bond movies do it well like goldfinger spy who loves me living daylights skyfall but many do not because lack character arc story we cannot forget about perhaps greatest car movie all time back future shining example how make car proper star now enters film by james mangold starring talented actors matt damon christian bale called ford v ferrari my arms crossed expectations lowered i was ready be disappointed although i love mangold as director somehow i assumed there would be michael bay approach movie putting more emphasis car action sequences than characters my surprise not only was i dead wrong but film became one best car movies i had ever seen thinking back i should have known better unlike many car action oriented movies this one is based true story fact based dramas tend take themselves more seriously it is sort shared biopic between legendary sports car designer carroll shelby race car driver ken miles movie focuses their efforts beat ferrari at le mans story im well aware like i said bonafide car nut mangold is oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with oscar winning people such as damon bale boy do their talents shine this movie driving engine story if you will is loving but at times clashing relationship between shelby miles portrayed brilliantly by damon bale manner that my opinion is more entertaining engaging than dynamic duo dicaprio pitt once upon time hollywood damon bale have different styles acting but both arrive at same place creating character that faces disappointment search victory shelby has come terms with disappointment having quit his racing career due heart problems creating winning team at le mans is his way proving himself hes still winner miles is desperate not disappoint himself because unlike shelby hes never had shot at winning at big race this is due his abrasive personality despite amazing talent race track top this miles desperately doesnt want disappoint his wife son who support him fervently his dream both characters have their own obstacles search escaping disappointment with shelby dealing with suits at ford miles dealing with problems car race as they present themselves trial besting other race car drivers their individual struggles intersect mutual desire win at le mans resulting brotherhood mutual love each other that feels genuine earned henry ford ii played by very effective tracy letts reveals quick but moving scene why he wants win at le mans after shelby takes ford whirlwind nauseating ride with new race car they have engineered ford breaks into tears not so much because physically jarring experience being jostled around at breakneck speed but because what car means his family name i had no idea if only my dad were alive see this he tells shelby damon that scene responds with wet eyes character ford reveals how much he doesnt want disappoint his family legacy fact entire endeavor started with insult ferrari stating youre only henry ford second youll never be henry ford earlier scene ford compares himself his legendary grandfather speech ford factory workers concerning his disappointment current company sales cars represent mans desire chase dream whether it be designing fastest car or driving cars fastest despite all obstacles that may get mans way biggest one is always himself but with perseverance help others this obstacle can too be overcome ford v ferrari manages get heart this message with deceptive ease supreme confidence films absolutely gorgeous cinematography direction capture some most amazing car sequences ever put big screen surprising but believable behind scenes factoid is that mangold cast are not car nuts at all were simply moved tell story characters this is why movie works so well because they understood car as supporting story rather than other way around ford v ferrari is absolute winner with memorable performances its cast my favorite mangold picture thus far me it is one best year as far as car movies go one best ever made miles away disappointment,0.5206403659233847,0.1961449399656947,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,As close as possible to the truth but!,"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars.",as close as possible truth but,i was at philadelphia film center premiere 11 11 19 view this terrific movie at age 68 tifoso ferrari since age 8 1959 this movie hit nerve truth vs fiction this was david vs goliath movie however goliath wins movie recreates golden era auto racing it was seriously dangerous with death injury guarantee at every race these drivers were absolute warriors were fearless now ferrari winning lemans six straight years row 1960 1965 is actually david this movie ferrari all their dominant winning form was still tiny company that sold fancy 15 000 sportcars support his racing team winning lemans was 16 500 team prize these ferrari drivers were salaried prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit engine size there was under 2 liter class that porsche ferrari dino control but over 2 liter was unlimited i read carefully about ford move acquire ferrari as daily news reports would cross associated press movie is spot about ford cars lacking desire back then chevrolet had corvette corvair sporty looking impala chevelle now ford is goliath this movie they are big corporate giant with unlimited resources ford paid ford gt it was really lola gt with ford badge put it ford put their name every innovation provided by all racing equipment suppliers that went into that race car unlike ferrari being designed engineered built handmade that italian factory ford spent more money developing racecar than total price buy ferrari outright hired every nascar team provide expert pit crews engine builders offered 80 000 100 000 each driver one race now movie its movie that non race cars fans can will enjoy it shows how shelby miles are really heroes winning team this was true their relationship is spot movie they know what is needed win they battle off track against ford executives against ferrari track what is not disclosed movie is quitting ferrari ace driver john surtees when he left ferrari team was devastated he along with fords ken miles were two true warriors also not shown but lightly covered movie is three years disastrous outing ford racing team did shelby steal ferrari pits stop watches did shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into ferrari pit lane make ferrari pit crew think that race car was missing nut car out track did enzo ferrari actually tip his hat honor ken miles who really knows everybody is dead i remember lug nut rumour 1960s as that was southern stock car trick i never heard about theft ferrari stop watches by shelby as far as ferrari tipping his hat ferrari was known or not attending many races all that aside did i as ferrari fan enjoy this movie my answer is yes yes yes with exception james garner grand prix this is best movie deal with sport autoracing bonus is that it is also great human interest story they create mood sixties as u vividly remember it i rate this movie ten should be nominated oscars,0.43846153846153857,0.1485576923076923,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,A well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama,"Ford v Ferrari is a biographical drama film directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted). Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it is a well-told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama.In 1963, the Ford Motor Company recruits famous racecar driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to assist them with designing a car that will help them beat their arch rivals Ferrari at the Le Mons race in France. To aid him with such a task, Carroll decides to enlist the help of British mechanic and fellow racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to test for any flaws and eventually race in the finished product itself. At first, the two of them make great progress, however Ken's brash personality and blunt honesty puts him at odds with the higher ups at Ford, causing the company to believe he may not be the right person to be racing their car and representing them abroad.With its fast pacing and heartfelt drama to match, Ford v Ferrari rises above the typical car racing film to become one of the most interesting portraits of an intense rivalry in recent memory. The film isn't so much about the cars themselves as as it is about staying relevant in the public eye and maintaining a respectable image. From the very beginning, we are given the idea of how desperate Ford are to shake off their reputation of being perceived as making outdated cars that only one's grandparents would drive. This is juxtaposed with the cool and hip-looking Ferrari being presented as more appealing to younger potential motorists. The resulting races are used to further the film's plot and aren't merely there for mindless entertainment. While it may be obvious to some viewers what the eventual outcome truly is, it is certainly a lot of fun anticipating what happens along the way.Director James Mangold successfully strikes the correct balance between car racing action and realistic human drama, so much so that virtually all audiences should be able to find something to be entertained by. His choices in editing and cinematography help move the film along at a breathless speed as we watch cars zoom past at high acceleration, sometimes resulting in some intense crash scenes. There are times though, where some of the mechanical jargon may prove confusing to non-racing enthusiasts such as myself as I did end up scratching my head at a few scenes where certain important car parts were being discussed by the characters. In addition to this, I wasn't quite sure about how some of the rules of the race track were showcased in the film, as it felt somewhat glanced over. Fortunately, these moments are infrequent and are often counteracted by the great acting of the film's leads.Christian Bale is such a joy to watch as Ken Miles, the unapologetic perfectionist racer who wants to push the limits of what a car can do. It caught me off-guard at first hearing him use his native British accent while surrounded by other Americans as I am so used to seeing him play only American characters. Matt Damon gave a nice performance as well, but I feel that he was overshadowed by Bale in most scenes. This is due to Damon essentially being the straight man to Bale's outspoken antics which did cause me to focus more on Bale instead.Overall, even if you aren't a huge fan of car racing films like me, this one contains more than enough entertainment to satisfy even the most car illiterate of audiences. The historic value of the depicted event makes for a solid drama and could possibly bring a newfound amount of respect to this genre in the near future.I rate it 8.5/10",well told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama,ford v ferrari is biographical drama film directed by james mangold logan walk line girl interrupted starring matt damon christian bale it is well told story that balances high octane car races with genuine drama 1963 ford motor company recruits famous racecar driver carroll shelby matt damon assist them with designing car that will help them beat their arch rivals ferrari at le mons race france aid him with such task carroll decides enlist help british mechanic fellow racer ken miles christian bale test any flaws eventually race finished product itself at first two them make great progress however kens brash personality blunt honesty puts him at odds with higher ups at ford causing company believe he may not be right person be racing their car representing them abroad with its fast pacing heartfelt drama match ford v ferrari rises above typical car racing film become one most interesting portraits intense rivalry recent memory film isnt so much about cars themselves as as it is about staying relevant public eye maintaining respectable image very beginning we are given idea how desperate ford are shake off their reputation being perceived as making outdated cars that only ones grandparents would drive this is juxtaposed with cool hip looking ferrari being presented as more appealing younger potential motorists resulting races are used further films plot arent merely there mindless entertainment while it may be obvious some viewers what eventual outcome truly is it is certainly lot fun anticipating what happens along way director james mangold successfully strikes correct balance between car racing action realistic human drama so much so that virtually all audiences should be able find something be entertained by his choices editing cinematography help move film along at breathless speed as we watch cars zoom past at high acceleration sometimes resulting some intense crash scenes there are times though where some mechanical jargon may prove confusing non racing enthusiasts such as myself as i did end up scratching my head at few scenes where certain important car parts were being discussed by characters addition this i wasnt quite sure about how some rules race track were showcased film as it felt somewhat glanced over fortunately these moments are infrequent are often counteracted by great acting films leads christian bale is such joy watch as ken miles unapologetic perfectionist racer who wants push limits what car can do it caught me off guard at first hearing him use his native british accent while surrounded by other americans as i am so used seeing him play only american characters matt damon gave nice performance as well but i feel that he was overshadowed by bale most scenes this is due damon essentially being straight man bales outspoken antics which did cause me focus more bale instead overall even if you arent huge fan car racing films like me this one contains more than enough entertainment satisfy even most car illiterate audiences historic value depicted event makes solid drama could possibly bring newfound amount respect this genre near future i rate it 8 5 10,0.4772316704459561,0.16243197278911564,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.51}"

9.0,Stunning!,"This film is like the cars it portrays. Slick on the surface, but complicated underneath. Yes it's a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I've watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can't carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari's dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a 'my way or the highway' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It's a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I'm fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, ""If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost"", but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day.

8.0,"'We're lighter, we're faster, and if that don't work, we're nastier'","James Mangold directs this historic visit to the 1960s, using the script written by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, and the result is a heart-pounding series of fast car racing events that surface as an entertaining film due to the presence of some very fine actors. Not only is it a recreation of the 1966 Le Mans event: it is also a penetrating statement about corporate behavior attempting to drown individual personal achievement!Briefly, American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The 'Ford' tent includes Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts), Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), and the Ferrari group is lead by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Significant roles include Ken's wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and their son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe), as well as Shelby's right hand man Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon).But towering over the entire epic are the acting chops of Mat Damon and Christian Bale, both of whom create fully three-dimensional roles that make the story come vividly to life.

However, lately there were quite a few great ones, like ""I, Tonya"" or ""Darkest Hour"". And man, this movie is definitely one of those great ones.The most fascinating aspect for me is that the movie is thrilling, it puts you on the edge of your sit for the entirety of it, the racing scenes are incredible, and it was truly a pleasure watching it without knowing Ken Miles' storyline, I was surprise a bunch of times. That's me though, I bet that most people would at least search a bit before watching the movie.Anyways, the movie has great cinematography, amazing performances by Damon and Bale. Also a shout out to Josh Lucas, he did great as well here, I hated him for most of the movie, and that was definitely the goal here.The score is good too. The movie is 2h30 hours long, but it never feels like it, you are so damn entertained by the thing, that when is ending you actually feel like you could watch another hour of it in a heartbeat.To sum up, James Mangold once again does a great job in his new movie, and he definitely has my attention now. Ford v Ferrari is a great movie for movie lovers but also for the casual moviegoer, who can simply watch for the sake of watching the racing sequences, at the end of the day, no one will be disappointed.",yes what great cine biography,ive been saying this years but making cine biography isnt easy i know movies arent exact science but most time i watch biography i found myself giving something around 7 when its just ok movie or even lower however lately there were quite few great ones like i tonya or darkest hour man this movie is definitely one those great ones most fascinating aspect me is that movie is thrilling it puts you edge your sit entirety it racing scenes are incredible it was truly pleasure watching it without knowing ken miles storyline i was surprise bunch times thats me though i bet that most people would at least search bit before watching movie anyways movie has great cinematography amazing performances by damon bale also shout out josh lucas he did great as well here i hated him most movie that was definitely goal here score is good too movie is 2h30 hours long but it never feels like it you are so damn entertained by thing that when is ending you actually feel like you could watch another hour it heartbeat sum up james mangold once again does great job his new movie he definitely has my attention now ford v ferrari is great movie movie lovers but also casual moviegoer who can simply watch sake watching racing sequences at end day no one will be disappointed,0.6034902597402597,0.2834280303030304,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"
