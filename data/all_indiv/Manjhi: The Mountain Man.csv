5,Failure to give justice ...,"This is a tale probably since its origin - BOLLYWOOD fails to give the necessary depth, breadth and focus to/on a topic. Whether it is the nation's heroes from Bajirao to Manjhi or it is a war epic, the focus is always on exaggerated display of love and other emotions and the facts are conveniently missed(since it requires more efforts and will). Some points to elaborate :1. Not a single minute was dedicated to how Manjhi broke the rocks and carved the mountain. Well, he spent nights thinking about the strategy. He used to collect weeds, grass etc., create fire on the rocks wherever possible and suddenly cool them to develop cracks so that they would crumble. The other 5-6 huge rocks he took 1 month each to develop cracks. No effort was made to show these aspects2. A torture of inept songs and Manjhi's bereaved love ! Just listen to his interviews and one would realize that his wife's death was just a trigger for his journey and the movie shows as if he is doing it only for his love - what a degenerated depiction of a man who had a much deeper and wider understanding of the social and practical problems plaguing the village3. Manjhi attempted to build a bridge on a nearby river(not shown in the film), walked to Delhi for raising funds(!). He always thought that the whole state needs help and openly said that, yet, the film focuses on his work as a madman, well a madman always has a vision, a plan and a dream. The film comes out short on projecting thisThe only savior for the films are its cast's efforts and few facts and dialogues.Ketan Mehta first messed up Mangal Pandey and now Dashrath Manjhi. Bollywood should needs to seriously alter its approach towards non- fictional works, else, they end up in reducing heroes to some fairy tale stories, rather than concrete examples of success...",failure give justice,this is tale probably since its origin bollywood fails give necessary depth breadth focus topic whether it is nations heroes bajirao manjhi or it is war epic focus is always exaggerated display love other emotions facts are conveniently missed since it requires more efforts will some points elaborate 1 not single minute was dedicated how manjhi broke rocks carved mountain well he spent nights thinking about strategy he used collect weeds grass etc create fire rocks wherever possible suddenly cool them develop cracks so that they would crumble other 5 6 huge rocks he took 1 month each develop cracks no effort was made show these aspects2 torture inept songs manjhis bereaved love just listen his interviews one would realize that his wifes death was just trigger his journey movie shows as if he is doing it only his love what degenerated depiction man who had much deeper wider understanding social practical problems plaguing village3 manjhi attempted build bridge nearby river not shown film walked delhi raising funds he always thought that whole state needs help openly said that yet film focuses his work as madman well madman always has vision plan dream film comes out short projecting thisthe only savior films are its casts efforts few facts dialogues ketan mehta first messed up mangal pandey now dashrath manjhi bollywood should needs seriously alter its approach towards non fictional works else they end up reducing heroes some fairy tale stories rather than concrete examples success,0.501031746031746,0.0773015873015873,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.48}"

10,An Oscar Winning Epic Story,"A truly awe-inspiring tale of a man's iron-will. The humble, vulnerable and impoverished character of Dashrat Manjhi's epic portrayal by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. A tragic love story which is woven into the fabric of poverty, evils of caste system and political brinkmanship. It keeps the audiences gripped with good comedy, action, thrills, romance. adventure, horror, fantasy and historic Biopic. Well edited no prolonged cut scenes, or unnecessary songs. Evolves into a streamlined fast paced bitter sweet movie for all to watch. There is no task bigger than breaking a mountain, so if he can so can you !!! The message is clear .... In-spite of the struggles, a man's vision to foresee a future when others disowned him shunned him as insane. Still achieves his lifetime of work in a monumental story of struggle although not beautiful, or carved out of marble like the ""Taj Mahal"", his work should be honoured and declared a wonder of this world.

8,"It is definitely worth watching thanks to the stupendous performances by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, superb direction and astounding background score.","Biopics are gaining popularity in Indian Cinema as it tells the true incident of a person or event portrayed on the silver screen. With Dirty Picture, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and now Manjhi-The Mountain Man following the trend, it is thoroughly inspiring and motivating. True to its hype, Manjhi-The Mountain Man lives up to the reputation and gives you hard-hitting drama with realistic views on life.Manjhi – The Mountain Man is a true story of guts and glory of Dashrath Manjhi who took 22 years to break a mountain to carve a road for his village – Gehlor in Gaya district of Bihar, India.It takes nerve of steel to make biography of not-so-famous personality who took 22 years of his life to break a mountain. After failure of Rang Rasiya, legendary film maker Ketan Mehta is back with a bang. The director who gave us some great films like Mirch Masala and Mangal Pandey takes a dig into another true story of a forgotten hero and we are not complaining at all. The movie begins with Manjhi loosing his wife as he blames the gigantic mountain for her death. The movie goes into a flashback mode showing his transformation from an innocent kid to a trouble-maker youth. Chance to meet his girlfriend changes him completely.Couple of scenes will steal the thunder – The chemistry between Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte, the transformation from loyal husband to obsessed old man and the well-executed climax scene. Hats off to Ketan Mehta and team ( Shahzad Ahmad for doing research and dialogue and Rajbali Anjum for the script) for standing out in the crowd. Screenplay loses the focus and too much of flashback will confuse you but the hiccups are only short-lived. Editing by Pratik Chitalia is good. Art direction by Nitin Chandrakant Desai is mind- blowing. Cinematography by Rajeev Jain is eye-catching. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is magnificent. He is probably one of the few actors who goes deep-diving into the any character with aplomb. Certainly an award wining performance from him. Radhika Apte is getting better with each. She emotes expressively. Rest of the star cast do justice to their roleManjhi – The Mountain Man has cult status written all over it.

10,Acting as rock solid as Dasarth Manjhi's will,"Expect no grandeur and very un-Bollywood-like. The plot of the movie unfolds quite slowly like a classic movie should be, building up gradually in the first half and then you are so engrossed into the movie, that you hardly realize how quickly the second half passed by. Nawazuddin Siddiqui could have been the only actor at of today who could do justice to this role. Ketan Mehta has made sure that the real touch in this movie sticks as close to the actual incidences and he has succeeded thoroughly. Many filmmakers attempt to use or portray the themes from this part of India (like Amir Khan's PK or Salman Khan's Dabang). One can easily find that genuineness of Bihari culture is so hollow that it brings down the impact of the movie, rather than uplift it. The way all the actors have delivered their dialogues or put on their costumes is phenomenal. Siddiqui's performance is a stand-out and without doubt, it'll a benchmark in Bollywood, IMHO. Craziness of Manjhi is a legacy for Indians and Siddiquit has succeeded in bringing that out on the silver screen.",acting as rock solid as dasarth manjhis will,expect no grandeur very un bollywood like plot movie unfolds quite slowly like classic movie should be building up gradually first half then you are so engrossed into movie that you hardly realize how quickly second half passed by nawazuddin siddiqui could have been only actor at today who could do justice this role ketan mehta has made sure that real touch this movie sticks as close actual incidences he has succeeded thoroughly many filmmakers attempt use or portray themes this part india like amir khans pk or salman khans dabang one can easily find that genuineness bihari culture is so hollow that it brings down impact movie rather than uplift it way all actors have delivered their dialogues or put their costumes is phenomenal siddiquis performance is stand out without doubt itll benchmark bollywood imho craziness manjhi is legacy indians siddiquit has succeeded bringing that out silver screen,0.3492690058479531,0.08260233918128654,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.41}"

9,A must watch. Shows what strong determination can achieve against all odds.,"""Manjhi - The Mountain Man"" takes you through the painful journey of a so-called low caste Bihari who takes on a mountain to avenge his wife's death. Story: Based on a true story, the movie depicts how, the determined Dashrath Manjhi carved out a road through a mountain using only hammer and chisel in spite of all the bashing received from the fellow villagers (including his father), conspiracies by the village head to stop him and fake promises by the government. In the backdrop, the movie spends some significant time in the build up of the entire story, which is the life of Dashrath Manjhi before the incident - introducing the audience to the rampant and barbaric view of caste based discrimination in Bihar during 50s and 60s, which is prevalent to some extent even today, not just in Bihar but across India. The story is extremely well written and thoroughly researched. It is a story that deserved to be told to the entire country. Acting: Apart from Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the movie doesn't boast of any big names. However, with the support cast of NSD stars - (late) Ashraf Ul Haq and Pankaj Tripathi - and the promising Radhika Apte, acting is one of the strongest departments of the movie. Their hard work behind projecting the characters is evident and the Bihari accent never sounds taught. The dialog delivery is impeccable and does great justice to the writer who wrote them. Some of the dialogs are very profound and will keep you pondering over it. A special mention for Radhika Apte who has rose like a phoenix through some of her recent performances in short movies - That Day After Every Day and Ahalya - and upped the benchmark in Manjhi, complementing and competing with Nawazuddin, in terms of acting. Direction: Ketan Mehta has done a stupendous job in terms of ensuring the movie doesn't lose momentum at any point of time. The flow of the story moves back and forth between the years before his wife's death and after the death. But never, for once, it loses audience attention - full marks to the editing team for that. Some of the scenes are a complete surprise in terms of conceptualization and executed to perfection. His depiction of the socio-political scenario in Gehlaur during 50s and 60s through various incidents that Dashrath Manjhi and his wife encounter shows the depth of research that has went before shooting the movie. Some of the scenes are gruesome (even though a reality at that time) and makes you cringe. At one point of time, it reminded me of Prisoners which had a similar aura. The Mountain: I would also add the ""mountain"" to the list of characters as the movie also portrays how its relationship with protagonist evolves over a period of time. Although the movie celebrates the victory of a man over a mountain, it also portrays Manjhi's relationship with the mountain and its evolution from his childhood till he carves out the road through it. Overall: Overall, the movie is a must watch. It shows what strong determination can achieve against all odds.",must watch shows what strong determination can achieve against all odds,manjhi mountain man takes you through painful journey so called low caste bihari who takes mountain avenge his wifes death story based true story movie depicts how determined dashrath manjhi carved out road through mountain using only hammer chisel spite all bashing received fellow villagers including his father conspiracies by village head stop him fake promises by government backdrop movie spends some significant time build up entire story which is life dashrath manjhi before incident introducing audience rampant barbaric view caste based discrimination bihar during 50s 60s which is prevalent some extent even today not just bihar but across india story is extremely well written thoroughly researched it is story that deserved be told entire country acting apart nawazuddin siddiqui movie doesnt boast any big names however with support cast nsd stars late ashraf ul haq pankaj tripathi promising radhika apte acting is one strongest departments movie their hard work behind projecting characters is evident bihari accent never sounds taught dialog delivery is impeccable does great justice writer who wrote them some dialogs are very profound will keep you pondering over it special mention radhika apte who has rose like phoenix through some her recent performances short movies that day after every day ahalya upped benchmark manjhi complementing competing with nawazuddin terms acting direction ketan mehta has done stupendous job terms ensuring movie doesnt lose momentum at any point time flow story moves back forth between years before his wifes death after death but never once it loses audience attention full marks editing team that some scenes are complete surprise terms conceptualization executed perfection his depiction socio political scenario gehlaur during 50s 60s through various incidents that dashrath manjhi his wife encounter shows depth research that has went before shooting movie some scenes are gruesome even though reality at that time makes you cringe at one point time it reminded me prisoners which had similar aura mountain i would also add mountain list characters as movie also portrays how its relationship with protagonist evolves over period time although movie celebrates victory man over mountain it also portrays manjhis relationship with mountain its evolution his childhood till he carves out road through it overall overall movie is must watch it shows what strong determination can achieve against all odds,0.5068854568854568,0.04028314028314028,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7,"More of Quality, Less of Entertainment...",Manjhi : The mountain man carried only by Nawazuddin. The films deals with a guy who breaks the mountain to take revenge for his wife's death. This film has lack of emotions and the intensity which it needed the most for this kind of script. Manjhi doesn't hit at the right spot of the audiences.  As Manjhi breaks the mountain without anyone's help same as Nawazuddin carries the whole film on his shoulder with his sheer brilliant acting. Manjhi is the sum up of all his previous work. His acting is the only thing which kept me hooked till the climax. He just not only played Manjhi but he also lived the character. Radhika Apte in a small but a powerful role left an strong impact on the audiences. She played the role of Phaguniya wonderfully. It was delighted to watch her on screen. The first half of the movie was brilliant but the climax was stretched unnecessarily. Background score and other technical aspect was good especially the screenplay of the film. The director's work is magnificent in the film but Don't get any high expectation from the movie just go for Nawazuddin and to watch his one of the best performances till date.,more quality less entertainment,manjhi mountain man carried only by nawazuddin films deals with guy who breaks mountain take revenge his wifes death this film has lack emotions intensity which it needed most this kind script manjhi doesnt hit at right spot audiences as manjhi breaks mountain without anyones help same as nawazuddin carries whole film his shoulder with his sheer brilliant acting manjhi is sum up all his previous work his acting is only thing which kept me hooked till climax he just not only played manjhi but he also lived character radhika apte small but powerful role left strong impact audiences she played role phaguniya wonderfully it was delighted watch her screen first half movie was brilliant but climax was stretched unnecessarily background score other technical aspect was good especially screenplay film directors work is magnificent film but dont get any high expectation movie just go nawazuddin watch his one best performances till date,0.5482539682539682,0.2455772005772006,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.03, 'Fear': 0.36}"
6,"Love and passion, deadly combination","I am positively biased with this film. Indeed, entertainment quotient is a bit less but motivational quotient is over flowing. Director Mr. Ketan Mehata work and motive are worth praising. This story must have been told. Story is simply unbelievable, credit goes to Shree Dashrath Manjhi and God only. Screenplay by director himself and Jakhar Mahendar, offers fresh and visual rich scenes. Like the scene, where both lead hide themselves in mud. It was cute and adorable. Love scenes are well conceived so they justify the motive and strength behind an impossible task. I do know its fact but still my mind sometimes refuse to believe on it. I am very tiny to ever understand the motive, decision and dedication of a man at the very beginning of this work and astonishingly keeping himself charging till the work get done. Simply unbelievable but definitely I feel motivated and charged by his journey. Screenplay had to follow fact while maintaining the silver screen requirements and they succeeded in it by incorporating few sub plots of the issues of that time. Like adding a Naxal hint. Dialogues by Vardraj Swami, Shahzad Ahmad are good and realistic. I fear people not aware of the local dialect would feel difficult to get some typical words but being well aware of that I enjoyed it most. Budget constraint is clearly visible in production value. Makers fail to establish the need of cutting the mountain and even they couldn't establish the progress of way being made visually and gradually. With the help of now a days advance technology I don't think it could have cost them so dearly because whenever main protagonist breaks a rock, I couldn't feel the need of braking any particular stone. It looks like he is just breaking a mountain aimlessly. I would have loved some aerial shots and graphics for this sake. Performance wise Nawazuddin Siddqui is actor par excellence. After a point you have to believe that he is the real Dashrath Majhi. Radhika Apte as Faguniya, is very good. Pankaj Tripathi as Rauab, is good. Tigmanshu Dhulia is fine. Prashant Narayan makes his presence felt in brief role. Ashraful Haque as Manjhi father in impressive. Vardraj Swami as Gopal's father is good. Music wise ""Sajanwa, sajanwa"" track is melodious.

4,"All Barks and No Bite, Manjhi is overly Melodramatic","Nawazuddin is one of the finest actors in India. He has given some of his greatest performances in the past and Manjhi is no exception. Nawazuddin Siddiqui shines in Manjhi: The Mountain Man and that is the best thing about this film albeit this performance does not match up to some of the other performances that he has given. He shines in the second half because the first half is comical. Radhika Apte is average, all the other actors show exaggerated emotions.Apart from that, there is nothing else that makes this film worth watching. Yes, it is INSPIRED by a true story of Dashrath Manjhi who broke a mountain to shorten the distance between his village and the hospital. I am saying ""INSPIRED"" because it does not show the actual events that happened. Many things have been changed from the real story just for the sake of making it melodramatic. Had they followed the actual events and made it less dramatic, it would have resulted in a much better film. There are so many dumb moments such as hiding in mud (really? How dumb can you get?) or Radhika Apte slapping Manjhi because he tried to beat the person who was harassing her. Then there are unnecessary half- baked subplots, the overly dramatic scenes dealing with the issue of untouchability).The walk to Delhi which could have been done in a better way is shown within 3-4 minutes which serves nothing to the film. It could have been impressive if done in a better way. Some of the dialogues are really good and some of them are laughable. The Direction is average and nothing great here. The screenplay is messy at times because it runs back and forth between flashback and present time. The dream sequences are not done in a good way. The background music is dull. This results in mediocre at best film.Manjhi had the potential of becoming a great film but the bad storytelling and fictional elements ruined it.Some people are still praising it because it has Nawazuddin in the main role and the guy has a big following. We Indians are really sensitive when it comes to voting on IMDb. We either give it a 1 or 10. Learn to accept the criticism. Anyone can give a bad film, there is nothing wrong in admitting that. Seems like the makers of Manjhi were more interested in making it more audience friendly rather than telling the story of Manjhi.",all barks no bite manjhi is overly melodramatic,nawazuddin is one finest actors india he has given some his greatest performances past manjhi is no exception nawazuddin siddiqui shines manjhi mountain man that is best thing about this film albeit this performance does not match up some other performances that he has given he shines second half because first half is comical radhika apte is average all other actors show exaggerated emotions apart that there is nothing else that makes this film worth watching yes it is inspired by true story dashrath manjhi who broke mountain shorten distance between his village hospital i am saying inspired because it does not show actual events that happened many things have been changed real story just sake making it melodramatic had they followed actual events made it less dramatic it would have resulted much better film there are so many dumb moments such as hiding mud really how dumb can you get or radhika apte slapping manjhi because he tried beat person who was harassing her then there are unnecessary half baked subplots overly dramatic scenes dealing with issue untouchability walk delhi which could have been done better way is shown within 3 4 minutes which serves nothing film it could have been impressive if done better way some dialogues are really good some them are laughable direction is average nothing great here screenplay is messy at times because it runs back forth between flashback present time dream sequences are not done good way background music is dull this results mediocre at best film manjhi had potential becoming great film but bad storytelling fictional elements ruined it some people are still praising it because it has nawazuddin main role guy has big following we indians are really sensitive when it comes voting imdb we either give it 1 or 10 learn accept criticism anyone can give bad film there is nothing wrong admitting that seems like makers manjhi were more interested making it more audience friendly rather than telling story manjhi,0.4864942528735632,0.10804597701149425,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.22}"

8,Great opportunity thrown away.,"The stage was set, a man against a mountain. The theme itself is a crowd puller. Obviously the movie will be filled with the emotions a soul must have underwent while performing the same task for 22 long years; that too against the acceptance of society. The man must have built a relation with the mountain, not a hateful one, but a relation of mutual respect; that had given him the determination, the perseverance. But surprisingly enough, instead of making this strange relation between a man and a mountain the USP of the movie, Ketan Mehta has made the movie revolve around the love story of Dasharath and Faguniya(His wife).

No cinematic excellence as such.The Good part now: Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a fine actor and he did pull the movie on his shoulders completely.

6,"Move Over Faith & Mountains, Embrace Love & Flattened Mountains. ♦ 62%","Until now Mirch Masala (1985) was what Ketan Mehta was known for. His foray into biographies didn't go well in the last decade of the previous century, but his latest attempt is really a shot in right direction.The non-linear screenplay introduces its audience to a rural village in the interiors of the Indian state of Bihar, which is partially run by a fascist authority in the 1950s-60s. A young boy named Dashrath Manjhi, born to poor farmer parents, is married off to a girl when boys his age would instead fancy playing tag, and is soon after sent away closer to the cities so that he is not exposed to the government's cruel ways. Fast forward a decade and a half - an adult Manjhi (Siddiqui) returns to his village, meets his wife Phaguniya (Apte), and starts a cheerful married life. He realizes that their happy days are over when his wife slips and falls off a huge hillock which eventually results in her death. Manjhi, a high-willed, idiosyncratic lover boy that he is, vows to avenge her death by locking horns with the hill; and his idea of revenge: tearing the mountain apart.The non-linearity plays out like a documentary without a good prologue, which compels a viewer to ask too many questions, at least in the first act. However, considering that one is unknown to the story which is true to some extent, once you get a fair idea as to what is happening, the middle act and conclusion is very fine. Chronicling the two strenuous decades that the mountain man spent breaking the peak with just the help of a chisel and a hammer is not what the film is all about. There is politics and history, and the way the former is showcased can polarize the opinions. I say documentary-like because a journalist character in the film kind of poorly narrates Manjhi's struggle in terms of years, making it look like a chronology test of a 10-year old.The humor is very light, and is strictly delivered by Siddiqui. His performance is top-notch and I can even risk saying that he is second to none when it comes to portraying a character like Manjhi, who was known for his madness and extraordinary determination. Although he is the star of the film in its most basic sense, I personally think that his characterization was type-cast as if making him do certain things is a norm now. Talking about Miss Elegance, I have grown fond of Apte over the years. Be it her bombed Malayalam language film Haram (2015) or her viral short film Ahalya (2015), her performance is something that you cannot term as acting; she lives her character.The biggest problem I had with the script was that I didn't know what went on Manjhi's mind before, during, and after he took on the impossible job. There is no insight into his strategy, if there was any, or at least the basic intention or the layout. This made it feel like we are watching a soap opera that is high on background noise, but low on substance. Still, there is a point towards the end where Manjhi realizes how his material nemesis was both cruel and kind enough to first kill his wife, and then let him break it apart, respectively; and that is the gist of the story. Nevertheless, the make-up, costumes, dialogs, and production design are brilliant. Lots of sub-stories were unnecessarily inserted into the period drama, which could have been a lot more solid had the makers focused solely on the feat. With Siddiqui at the helm, Mr. Mehta relies on cast performance and a legend story to steer a vehicle that has boxes in place of tires.BOTTOM LINE: Manjhi - The Mountain Man is no doubt a hard-worked depiction of an incredible story of a man who broke a mountain to prove his love, only that when you compare it with a similar but famous story of the Taj Mahal, you will still go with the latter. That is the powerlessness of the film.GRADE: B-VERDICT: One-time watch.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

5,Its the simple story of a forgotten hero,"""A Forgotten Hero."" The heroic and so emotional story of a deeply humble, uneducated man, finally convinced a Bollywood director to make a film on it. The obvious choice would be Nawazuddin Siddiquie for this role and there isn't an iota of doubt, whether he was able to pull it or not. Ketan Mehta who previously unearthed another story of an unsung hero, Mangal Pandey, again in his simple yet involving story telling style, was able to keep the eye balls of the audience hooked on to the screen. Unfortunately a blow to the movie was its leaked version on torrent, which gave a big jolt to the producer. The movie opened with just 1.5 Cr. It deserved a lot more. Radhika Apte as a supporting actor, playing the role of Dashrath Manjhi's wife, acted marvelously. The main catch of the movie was the authentic Bihari tone, which all the actors were speaking fluently. Talking about locations, it was a treat to the viewer's eye to actually see the bifurcated mountain, through which the brave man paved his own historic story. The villages and the India of 1950s was well portrayed and deserve a mention. Coming over to the music department, the songs in the movie were not that pleasing to hear, honestly. I am sure a better music director would have been a cherry on the cake. In short, this movie is a must watch for those who actually crave for something different from Sheila and Munni.",its simple story forgotten hero,forgotten hero heroic so emotional story deeply humble uneducated man finally convinced bollywood director make film it obvious choice would be nawazuddin siddiquie this role there isnt iota doubt whether he was able pull it or not ketan mehta who previously unearthed another story unsung hero mangal pandey again his simple yet involving story telling style was able keep eye balls audience hooked screen unfortunately blow movie was its leaked version torrent which gave big jolt producer movie opened with just 1 5 cr it deserved lot more radhika apte as supporting actor playing role dashrath manjhis wife acted marvelously main catch movie was authentic bihari tone which all actors were speaking fluently talking about locations it was treat viewers eye actually see bifurcated mountain through which brave man paved his own historic story villages india 1950s was well portrayed deserve mention coming over music department songs movie were not that pleasing hear honestly i am sure better music director would have been cherry cake short this movie is must watch those who actually crave something different sheila munni,0.5201269841269841,0.18600000000000003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.45}"

The dialogue 'Bhagwan K Bharose mat baithiye, kya pata bhagwan hamare bharose baitha ho' is going to stay in mind for years to come.
