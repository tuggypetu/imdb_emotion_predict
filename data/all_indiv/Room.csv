10.0,Imagine yourself as a 5 year old child discovering for the first time a brand new world exists outside of your room,"SPOILER: At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film ""ROOM"" won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. As Jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle and we the audience anticipate that Ma must try and escape with young Jack but how?The story draws similarities to the actual events that were Jaycee Lee Dugard's true life story which occurred on June 10, 1991, in South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in a make shift shed. There is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of Amanda Berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper Ariel Castro. This film was titled Cleveland Abduction and it was released in 2015. It tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over 10 years by Ariel Castro in his home with no one aware how close the girls were to their own homes and families.The film Room focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son. There are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever. Jack and Ma's is a story of isolation, fear, hopelessness versus hope and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. Room is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and best director. I give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating. This film is terrific!!",imagine yourself as 5 year old child discovering first time brand new world exists outside your room,spoiler at 2015 toronto international film festival film room won peoples choice award today it tells story young woman her five year old son who have been held captivity confined windowless living space six years brie larson stars as ma her son named jack is played by jacob tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as how ma convinces jack that their little world is real is wonderful as jack grows he starts ask questions about their isolated lifestyle we audience anticipate that ma must try escape with young jack but how story draws similarities actual events that were jaycee lee dugards true life story which occurred june 10 1991 south lake tahoe california dugard was 11 years old at time she was abducted street while she was walking home school bus stop she was held captive next 18 years concealed back yard make shift shed there is also some resemblance kidnapping amanda berry who had child fathered by her kidnapper ariel castro this film was titled cleveland abduction it was released 2015 it tells true story three girls who were held captive over 10 years by ariel castro his home with no one aware how close girls were their own homes families film room focuses more jack mas awkward adjustment life outside their room which was their entire world past six years there is strong supporting cast including performances such as joan allens role as jacks loving grandma ever convincing all star william h macy as resistant grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapists son there are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not find yourself becoming emotionally involved one particular very touching loving scene jack asks his grandma cut his long hair so that strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over his sick ma so she can return home hospital jack who understandably is initially withdrawn anyone other than his ma simply tells his grandma after she washes cuts his hair that he loves her this loving scene between jack his grandma will stay with me forever jack mas is story isolation fear hopelessness versus hope most importantly film about redemption family bond room is deserving oscar nomination best picture nominations few other categories as well such as best actress best actor best director i give film 9 5 out 10 rating this film is terrific,0.49618205868205867,0.21915885040885044,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,"A brilliant movie, but painful to watch","Room (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother (""Ma"")The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother are held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated her, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived in a small, locked shed, which they call ""Room."" Jack's mother has lived in ""Room"" since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has lived there for all of his life--five years.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it.What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because it might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic, frightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time.Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has to be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant. Director Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such great performances from his actors.This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped men who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the lives of those women without becoming depressed. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small screen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally before you begin.",brilliant movie but painful watch,room 2015 i was directed by lenny abrahamson it stars jacob tremblay as jack brie larson as his mother ma situation becomes very clear early film jack his mother are held captive by man who has kidnapped her raped her impregnated her uses her as his sexual slave jack his mother have lived small locked shed which they call room jacks mother has lived room since she was abducted seven years earlier jack has lived there all his life five years by incredible ingenuity motivated by love ma has kept jack realizing horrors their situation its hard believe that anyone could be so motivated capable allowing boy believe that his situation is normal but it works film you accept it what happens next is pretty well known but i wont go into it because it might decrease your enjoyment movie its dramatic frightening heart wrenching all at same time brie larson does wonderful job as mother jacob tremblay has be best child actor we have he is absolutely brilliant director abrahamson must be extremely talented man draw two such great performances his actors this is must see film but its not easy watch even though room wasnt based any specific incident we all know cases warped men who have kidnapped enslaved women its hard think about lives those women without becoming depressed we saw film at excellent little theatre rochester ny given claustrophobic atmosphere movie it will work small screen as well seek it out watch but prepare yourself mentally before you begin,0.6211616161616162,0.17300505050505052,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,A tense and compelling film,"Lenny Abrahamson's Room opens in a 10 x 10 room that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life, saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with some pleasure.Not that he lacks for companionship. Ma (Brie Larson) is with him and their endless days consist of cooking, reading, and watching TV where Jack is told that what he sees on the screen is not real, only pretend. All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) brings food and other household items but when he comes, Jack has to hide in his wardrobe, out of sight. Ma, we find out, has been kept prisoner and used for sex by the hulking man who comes every night and we know that Jack is a result of his mother's rape. Jack is the focus of the film and we see everything from his point of view, with the help of his sometime narration but we can also get into his mother's mind and feel her pain and live her dreams.There is never any doubt of his mother's love though the obvious strain of keeping herself from crying out every minute is painfully obvious. To Jack, she is the center of his world and his reason for being. When the second half of the film takes a surprising turn and shifts 180 degrees, Jack and Ma are not prepared for what awaits them. Even when an alternative is suggested as possible, he doesn't want to hear anything about a different world with blue sky and rivers and trees. Room is a tense and compelling film in which Brie Larson more than fulfills the brilliance that she showed in Short Term 12 and should make her an Oscar contender. Tremblay is also superb.He lives his character and makes him come alive, even though he is only nine years old. Supporting roles by Joan Allen and William H. Macy also contribute to the film's second half but it is always Larson and Tremblay that carry the day. The film is not mawkish or sentimental even though the soaring score by Stephen Rennicks comes close. While there are has some plot implausibilities, the film is a tribute to the resiliency and the dedicated love of a parent for their child. It is also a teaching experience. Like many who are walled off from each other and think the box they are in is all there is, the film can give us the combination to open the locked door, if we take the risk to turn the key.",tense compelling film,lenny abrahamsons room opens 10 x 10 room that has no windows locked door no light other than that provided by overhead skylight jack jacob tremblay slight five year old boy with hair down his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life saying hello his world he says hello not sun or grass outside his front door where he can run laugh play but only objects which is all his world consists lamp sink plant refrigerator his only friend is mouse that he feeds with some pleasure not that he lacks companionship ma brie larson is with him their endless days consist cooking reading watching tv where jack is told that what he sees screen is not real only pretend all he knows world is what he sees front his eyes old nick sean bridgers brings food other household items but when he comes jack has hide his wardrobe out sight ma we find out has been kept prisoner used sex by hulking man who comes every night we know that jack is result his mothers rape jack is focus film we see everything his point view with help his sometime narration but we can also get into his mothers mind feel her pain live her dreams there is never any doubt his mothers love though obvious strain keeping herself crying out every minute is painfully obvious jack she is center his world his reason being when second half film takes surprising turn shifts 180 degrees jack ma are not prepared what awaits them even when alternative is suggested as possible he doesnt want hear anything about different world with blue sky rivers trees room is tense compelling film which brie larson more than fulfills brilliance that she showed short term 12 should make her oscar contender tremblay is also superb he lives his character makes him come alive even though he is only nine years old supporting roles by joan allen william h macy also contribute films second half but it is always larson tremblay that carry day film is not mawkish or sentimental even though soaring score by stephen rennicks comes close while there are has some plot implausibilities film is tribute resiliency dedicated love parent their child it is also teaching experience like many who are walled off each other think box they are is all there is film can give us combination open locked door if we take risk turn key,0.4779671717171718,0.06395775941230487,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,A Harrowing Film with Incredible Performances!,"Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the film's hefty nature.'Room' Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world.'Room' is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good people. But its also about hope & fighting back. Its shocking to see the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed & often disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son & mother escape. The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke down.'Room' is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is consistently powerful & the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny Abrahamson's Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic, unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.Performance-Wise: Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance. The child does wonders & makes 'Room' unforgettable. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen & The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.On the whole, 'Room' is a must watch!

9.0,Claustrophobic beauty,"That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as 'Room'. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.What could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost. Really appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little. For my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.However, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick. Production values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness. Can't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard cliché role.Overall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox",claustrophobic beauty,that review summary may sound very oxymoronic but me it applies film such as room film with difficult subject that is stuff nightmares but tells it so beautifully with interesting approach that works better than all potential traps that films its genre could fall under what could have easily have been told lurid gratuitous way being inspired by true life case josef fritzl is instead told careful restrained way there is even innocence room due its very fascinating decision tell it viewpoint five year old this case jack one that comes off very movingly gives sense that there is little ray hope seemingly hopeless situation source material equally brilliant is be thanked here its author emily donoghue adapts it screen here none its power is lost really appreciated careful restrained approach storytelling room me many others it was something different considering subject it does though affect some pacing middle act where little tension seen especially first part is lost little my tastes too though it probably did fit films younger more innocent viewpoint its told music score does lay it too thick with treacle however loved how story was told its approach what room also strongly benefitted being told this way was that mother son relationship was able shine through really resonate which it may not have done as effectively with heavier tone shine through it does with great charm poignancy also appreciated that none characters were painted too black white even old nick production values are effectively claustrophobic nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish room is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked how mother son bonds do dire situations do ability combine both ensure powerful experience directing job thats both unsettling empathetic similarly room is written with effortless skill deft thoughtfulness cant find anything fault performances superb one brie larson that was very worthy oscar golden globe bafta too win her category is obvious starting point but one mustnt overlook beyond his years turn young jacob tremblay one best child acting performances recent years william h macy joan allen both giving some their best work years sean bridgers also gives much more what could have been standard clich role overall great powerful film but somewhat fascinatingly unconventional genre way story was told wont work some 9 10 bethany cox,0.5527777777777777,0.20612318840579713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Awesome film - shame about the trailer,"Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? And that's where I'll leave this synopsis, since (if you've been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here.This is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny ""Frank"" Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the 'evil kidnapper', is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.The film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that ""Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives"".The acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn't great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won't give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year's weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story.Supporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy's mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the ""Bourne"" films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper.At 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true 'teaser trailer' this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and 'given a good talking to' for this travesty. It's like putting all of the twists in films like ""The Crying Game"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Gone Girl"" in their respective trailers. I've gone so far as to create my own One Mann's Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.A leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of ""Die Hard"" or ""Fast and Furious"" fans.

,A non-traditional thriller with another brilliant turn from Brie Larson but an even better one from Jacob Tremblay.,"Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn.Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, Room introduces us to Ma and Jack, a mother and son held captive in a garden shed. As we learn more about their captivity, their world becomes clearer and clearer to us. They live by a routine, have names for every object in room, and Ma must be careful as her son grows older and more curious.The film is structured into two halves, and by now it's no spoiler that the second half deals with their readjustment into the outside world, and Jack's first time outside of room. The film is thematically complex, yet never overwhelming. At its core it's about motherhood, but Jack's unique upbringing complicates things.Director Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie never loses sight of that.I wrote about the pressure placed on child actors in my review for the incredible Beasts of No Nation, and Jacob Tremblay fits like a glove. Like Abraham Attah, he isn't a child actor, but an actor who just happens to be of a younger age. His wide eyes and expressive thoughts are very believable, and when he sees the outside world for the first time, it's a thing of beauty. Tremblay has brilliant chemistry with Brie Larson, and for one second I never doubted her devotion to him. As Ma faces frustrating upon leaving room, from her parents, doctors, and the media, she never forgets her son Jack, and always puts his wellbeing first. Larson taps into this character, one that undergoes a stunning transformation as she basically lost seven years of her life being locked up. Her performance will blow you away.The best actors are the ones able to transport you into their characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime.

10.0,This one is gonna stick with me,"""Room"" is an adaption of an internationally best-seller novel written by Irish playwright and novelist, Emma Donoghue. This is her first book to be adapted into a major motion picture and I have to say that it is a rather impressive one. I have not read Emma's novel yet, but I can only guess that this movie sticks to the novel's roots, considering that Emma decided to write the screenplay herself. Room is a story about a women who was kidnapped during her high school years and locked in a shed for 7 years. She was impregnated by her kidnapper in this room and was locked inside with the child. The child grows up and around the age of five is when the movie picks up. Throughout this entire movie we are taken through this story strictly from the Jack's (the child) point of view. Even though this story is experienced through the lens of this child, the story is in no way filtered or gussied up. It is this intimate and raw story about a child and his mother spending a hugely relevant portion of their existence stuck in this dull, dirty and claustrophobia-inducing shed. This shed contained one small window that emits a tiny portion of daylight into the room. To me, this represented a light at the end of the tunnel. Sort of like a tiny glimmer of hope in a deep and dark abyss. Throughout this entire movie, Jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon the world. Jacob Trembley portrays this character with such a sense of wonder and innocence that every single narration that I hear from this boy is just heartbreaking. Every time Jack takes away something from the world, he takes it in as something new and exciting even if it is scary. They are things that everyone takes for granted everyday: trees, dogs, the sky, etc. You would think that the dramatic climax would be at the beginning when Jack gets out of the tiny room he has been locked in his entire life, but after-wards, this film just drags in one dramatic scene after another in a way that turns this film into one big heartache an experience. I do have say that Jacob Trembley and Allison Brie's performances carry a lot of the weight of this film. Allison gives a very natural and organic performance. You never catch her overacting or being too stiff during any scene in this movie. Jack Trembley gave one of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Not just because of his age, but because of how well of a dramatic performance that he gives without over or underacting in any of his scenes. He seemed to take his role with a very adult-like seriousness that translated into a lot of the movie's themes of innocence that are chased by the persistent and harsh reality that Jack and his mother are facing. The directing and cinematography in this film are beautiful. The film's intense theme is complimented with a variety of out-of- focus and close up shots that highlight the child's immediate consciousness as he takes the outside world with fresh- eyes. Many of the scenes are also complimented by a beautiful and breathtaking film score composed by the award-winning Stephen Rennicks who has been crafting soundtracks in the indie film world since 1997. Overall, this is a film that I won't be forgetting for the rest of my life. Mainly because it is a film about escaping outside of the room that you have been stuck in your whole life and discovering a world that has been hidden from you. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but this film does it in the most grounded and intense way possible. Not to mention that it is dosed with themes of abandonment, human-kindness, and media exploitation. I don't usually give films a 10/10. As a matter of fact, I could probably count the films this year that I do consider 10s on one hand. The films I consider perfect are life changing in some way or benchmarks in cinematic history. While this film will probably be washed away by the ever expanding ocean that is cinema, it is not a movie that I will be personally ever forgetting. I can't remember watching a film that made me feel so grateful for just being alive.",this one is gonna stick with me,room is adaption internationally best seller novel written by irish playwright novelist emma donoghue this is her first book be adapted into major motion picture i have say that it is rather impressive one i have not read emmas novel yet but i can only guess that this movie sticks novels roots considering that emma decided write screenplay herself room is story about women who was kidnapped during her high school years locked shed 7 years she was impregnated by her kidnapper this room was locked inside with child child grows up around age five is when movie picks up throughout this entire movie we are taken through this story strictly jacks child point view even though this story is experienced through lens this child story is no way filtered or gussied up it is this intimate raw story about child his mother spending hugely relevant portion their existence stuck this dull dirty claustrophobia inducing shed this shed contained one small window that emits tiny portion daylight into room me this represented light at end tunnel sort like tiny glimmer hope deep dark abyss throughout this entire movie jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon world jacob trembley portrays this character with such sense wonder innocence that every single narration that i hear this boy is just heartbreaking every time jack takes away something world he takes it as something new exciting even if it is scary they are things that everyone takes granted everyday trees dogs sky etc you would think that dramatic climax would be at beginning when jack gets out tiny room he has been locked his entire life but after wards this film just drags one dramatic scene after another way that turns this film into one big heartache experience i do have say that jacob trembley allison bries performances carry lot weight this film allison gives very natural organic performance you never catch her overacting or being too stiff during any scene this movie jack trembley gave one most if not most impressive performances year not just because his age but because how well dramatic performance that he gives without over or underacting any his scenes he seemed take his role with very adult like seriousness that translated into lot movies themes innocence that are chased by persistent harsh reality that jack his mother are facing directing cinematography this film are beautiful films intense theme is complimented with variety out focus close up shots that highlight childs immediate consciousness as he takes outside world with fresh eyes many scenes are also complimented by beautiful breathtaking film score composed by award winning stephen rennicks who has been crafting soundtracks indie film world since 1997 overall this is film that i wont be forgetting rest my life mainly because it is film about escaping outside room that you have been stuck your whole life discovering world that has been hidden you i know that sounds kind cheesy but this film does it most grounded intense way possible not mention that it is dosed with themes abandonment human kindness media exploitation i dont usually give films 10 10 as matter fact i could probably count films this year that i do consider 10s one hand films i consider perfect are life changing some way or benchmarks cinematic history while this film will probably be washed away by ever expanding ocean that is cinema it is not movie that i will be personally ever forgetting i cant remember watching film that made me feel so grateful just being alive,0.5577749173903019,0.12708789928020695,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,Taking What Could Have Been Maudlin to the Stratosphere,"I hesitated seeing this film because I feared it would be another one of those exploitation films, with scene after scene of threat and pain. Considering a woman and her son have been kept for years in a room in a shed by a sociopath, this could have gone down that road, there are certainly elements of this. But this is about survival and hope, neither of which comes without agonizing risk. It's also about how people deal with things for which they have no true appreciation. I refer to two characters. The first is the father of the young woman. He must deal with what he sees as the devil's spawn. The second, a reporter that begins to malign her because she hasn't done what ""she"" sees as heroic. Her interview made me crawl, but I also thought this is exactly what we do to people who gain celebrity through pain.

10.0,The best film I've seen in years: indescribable!,"I know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending, unbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP).

9.0,Intelligently moving.,"When I didn't know if there were films that could surprise me, this film was able to do that. I believe that it is not a perfect film, there are some flaws and weaknesses in the script, if we have time to analyze it more deeply. After some reading I realized that the film is based, very vaguely, on a real situation that occurred in Austria just over fifteen years ago, and that it was a true horror film turned into reality.The film is profound and touching in many ways. First, because it brings us a cruel history of deprivation of liberty, rape, abuse and suffering. Second, because it tells us all this from the innocent perspective of a child who has never seen the world beyond the room where he was born, and where he lives imprisoned with his mother, at the hands of a cruel man, who is also his biological father, but that the film will make clear that he is not the boy's father. And in fact, what father would deserve to be treated as such after doing something like that to a son, isn't it? The film is truly beautiful and elegant, and wonderfully harmonizes the child's perspective, who sees the world and things in his own way, and the mother's perspective, which is basically ours too, and who has a clear sense of what is happening and the drama they're experiencing.Despite the harshness of the story told, the film never assumes itself as a thriller or a drama. In fact, there is a touch of fairy tale that greatly softens the tone and ambience. At no time did we feel truly tense, despite the situation of the characters being tense and not envisaging much success. The second half of the film is even smoother and more luminous, and shows how mother and child will try to rebuild their lives and their families after all that tragedy.The film does not have a big cast, and the characters have plenty of time to develop and take on complex psychological nuances and contours. The most developed and interesting are clearly the Mother and her son, Jack. And Brie Larson was amazing at how she brought this desperate and brave mother to life. She was capable of one of the most breathtaking and professional dramatic and interpretive works I have seen in some time, and deserved the awards she received for this film in all fairness. Jacob Tremblay, who brought Jack to life, also deserves congratulations. Apparently, and despite his young age, he already had some experience as an actor when he made this film, but there is no doubt that we rarely see actors so young shining so completely. He did a better job than many adults would have done, I am sure of that. And the way both actors interact in front of the camera is magnificent, dignified, credible and genuine. I also really liked the work of Joan Allen and Sean Bridgers, although the film does not reveal what happens to the villain, who just disappears.Technically, it is a superb and intelligent film. One thing that I observed carefully, and that I did not want to miss, was the quality of the dialogues, in particular Jack's monologues, in which he makes very pertinent and intelligent observations to the world around him. It is wonderful to enter the child's mind and see the world through his eyes. Cinematography is equally extraordinary, especially in the first half of the film, due to the way the camera manages to convey the feeling of being in such a limited space. The setting and the smallness of the entire physical filming space clearly helped and the construction of the whole set and costumes was also a smart bet on the part of Lenny Abrahamson, who ensured the direction of the film. It is a slow-paced film, with time for many reflections and ramblings that never seem to be too much in the film. The soundtrack is quite good, but it does not distract us from the essential, which is the story told and the relationship between that mother and her child, and between that child and the new world that opens up for her.",intelligently moving,when i didnt know if there were films that could surprise me this film was able do that i believe that it is not perfect film there are some flaws weaknesses script if we have time analyze it more deeply after some reading i realized that film is based very vaguely real situation that occurred austria just over fifteen years ago that it was true horror film turned into reality film is profound touching many ways first because it brings us cruel history deprivation liberty rape abuse suffering second because it tells us all this innocent perspective child who has never seen world beyond room where he was born where he lives imprisoned with his mother at hands cruel man who is also his biological father but that film will make clear that he is not boys father fact what father would deserve be treated as such after doing something like that son isnt it film is truly beautiful elegant wonderfully harmonizes childs perspective who sees world things his own way mothers perspective which is basically ours too who has clear sense what is happening drama theyre experiencing despite harshness story told film never assumes itself as thriller or drama fact there is touch fairy tale that greatly softens tone ambience at no time did we feel truly tense despite situation characters being tense not envisaging much success second half film is even smoother more luminous shows how mother child will try rebuild their lives their families after all that tragedy film does not have big cast characters have plenty time develop take complex psychological nuances contours most developed interesting are clearly mother her son jack brie larson was amazing at how she brought this desperate brave mother life she was capable one most breathtaking professional dramatic interpretive works i have seen some time deserved awards she received this film all fairness jacob tremblay who brought jack life also deserves congratulations apparently despite his young age he already had some experience as actor when he made this film but there is no doubt that we rarely see actors so young shining so completely he did better job than many adults would have done i am sure that way both actors interact front camera is magnificent dignified credible genuine i also really liked work joan allen sean bridgers although film does not reveal what happens villain who just disappears technically it is superb intelligent film one thing that i observed carefully that i did not want miss was quality dialogues particular jacks monologues which he makes very pertinent intelligent observations world around him it is wonderful enter childs mind see world through his eyes cinematography is equally extraordinary especially first half film due way camera manages convey feeling being such limited space setting smallness entire physical filming space clearly helped construction whole set costumes was also smart bet part lenny abrahamson who ensured direction film it is slow paced film with time many reflections ramblings that never seem be too much film soundtrack is quite good but it does not distract us essential which is story told relationship between that mother her child between that child new world that opens up her,0.5643375721500721,0.24130275974025966,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Jacob Tremblay gives one of the finest child performances of all time.,"There is a lot to admire about this film. The direction in the first hour and the final minutes, especially gets the most out of the concept and manages to make a 10 by 10 foot space seem like everything and eventually nothing. Likewise, the direction leaves much of the horror to the imagination and it is all the more chilling as a result. The screenplay is sparse and spartan in the way real life is around such horrific events. I like that several of the tensions in the story, i.e. grandfather's inability to deal with his grandson, are left unresolved. Finally Larson gives one hell of an understated, yet raw, performance that elevates the already strong material.But much credit has to be given to Jacob Tremblay as well as the director for producing one of the finest, if not the finest, child performances of all time. I haven't seen a child actor as natural and real since at least Justin Henry in Kramer vs Kramer 40+ years ago. Tremblay has no artifice or pretension at all. Jack isn't cloying and so much of the emotional power comes from that character. It would be a remarkable performance no matter what but Jack is a hard character to play. Strictly speaking, Jack is the protagonist and it is his story-the movie at its core is a coming of age tale (abet a messed up one). The scenario that Jack is in is just hard for any person to really sell, let alone a child actor. It is a very good performance.This is a good movie. It is hopeful in the end but it is intense.",jacob tremblay gives one finest child performances all time,there is lot admire about this film direction first hour final minutes especially gets most out concept manages make 10 by 10 foot space seem like everything eventually nothing likewise direction leaves much horror imagination it is all more chilling as result screenplay is sparse spartan way real life is around such horrific events i like that several tensions story i e grandfathers inability deal with his grandson are left unresolved finally larson gives one hell understated yet raw performance that elevates already strong material but much credit has be given jacob tremblay as well as director producing one finest if not finest child performances all time i havent seen child actor as natural real since at least justin henry kramer vs kramer 40 years ago tremblay has no artifice or pretension at all jack isnt cloying so much emotional power comes that character it would be remarkable performance no matter what but jack is hard character play strictly speaking jack is protagonist it is his story movie at its core is coming age tale abet messed up one scenario that jack is is just hard any person really sell let alone child actor it is very good performance this is good movie it is hopeful end but it is intense,0.5478347578347578,0.10108262108262107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.35}"

5.0,Disturbing abduction plot and subsequent redemption tale doesn't rise above the level of an average Lifetime Movie,"Room is based on the 2010 novel of the same name by the Irish turned Canadian novelist/playwright Emma Donoghue. The film has already garnered accolades from almost all critical quarters with heaps of approbation for its lead actress, Brie Larson. It's a rather uncomplicated story with a plot that is broken up into two distinct parts.For the first 45 minutes or so, a young mother, Joy, and five year old son, Jack, appear trapped in a small room where they've been residing for quite a long time. Eventually it's revealed we're watching a horror story: seven years earlier, when Joy was 17 years old, she was kidnapped by a neighborhood pervert, Old Nick, who has kept her prisoner in a shed next to his house. Old Nick makes what appear to be weekly visits bringing groceries but also rapes Joy whenever he comes over. There's no escape from the room that only has one skylight window since Old Nick is the only one who knows the numbers to the combination lock to enter.Jack is born as a result of Old Nick violating Joy and it's her son that's the only thing keeping her alive. The child does remarkably well despite growing up in such a deprived environment. Joy teaches Jack how to make a birthday cake and he plays with the limited amount of objects found in the room—occasionally Old Nick might bring the boy a present (such as an electric model car). There are of course tensions between mother and son—Joy doesn't react well when Jack throws a tantrum for example.The best part of the picture is the way in which Joy and Jack are rescued from this abominable situation--but unfortunately it's not all that believable. Joy's plan is to have Jack pretend that he's dead and instruct him how to escape from inside a rolled up rug after Old Nick drives away in his pickup to dispose of the ""body."" The entire escape is predicated on Old Nick's decision not to check to see if Jack is really dead—as the scene plays out, Old Nick inexplicably backs off after Joy screams at him not to look at Jack because (as she explains it to him), she can't stomach the idea of the pervert touching her dead son. The subsequent way in which Jack miraculously escapes from Old Nick's truck and the heart- pounding way in which the police figure out where the little boy came from, make up for the slow-moving turn of events in Act One.The second half of Room does not have the rising tension found in the first. The focus on how all the family members adjust is what the second half of Act Two is all about. Joy returns home to find her mother Nancy divorced from her father Robert, and now married to Leo. There is an underdeveloped subplot involving Robert who is repulsed by the idea that Jack was conceived through rape and that his father was pervert Old Nick. Robert goes home to an out of state residence and his catalog of resentments remain unexplored.A better subplot involves the intrusion of the media upon Joy and the rest of the family. Joy agrees to give an interview to a reporter for money and she asks her painful questions about what went on with Old Nick and whether she made the right decision in raising Jack and depriving him of a normal childhood (the suggestion is made that she could have convinced Old Nick to leave the newborn Jack anonymously at a hospital). Conflict develops between Joy and Nancy and eventually there's the rather predictable trope of Joy attempting suicide. Most critics found Jack's acclimation to his new found world to be touching and cathartic. When he bonds with Leo's dog and a new pal next door, all seems right with the world. And even Joy is seen getting herself together at film's end.So what is one to think of all this? It's a story that I suppose holds one's interest to the end; although the central twist (i.e. the escape), feels contrived. While the young Jacob Tremblay did a fine job playing Jack, his successful adjustment to the outside world feels to me much more schematic than cathartic, as many critics insist. As for Brie Larson, calls for her to win an Oscar for best actress seem misplaced--although her performance is fine given the pedestrian script.In the end, Room rises to the level of an average Lifetime movie, with a few interesting twists and turns here and there but more predictable elements making up the bulk of the overall proceedings.",disturbing abduction plot subsequent redemption tale doesnt rise above level average lifetime movie,room is based 2010 novel same name by irish turned canadian novelist playwright emma donoghue film has already garnered accolades almost all critical quarters with heaps approbation its lead actress brie larson its rather uncomplicated story with plot that is broken up into two distinct parts first 45 minutes or so young mother joy five year old son jack appear trapped small room where theyve been residing quite long time eventually its revealed were watching horror story seven years earlier when joy was 17 years old she was kidnapped by neighborhood pervert old nick who has kept her prisoner shed next his house old nick makes what appear be weekly visits bringing groceries but also rapes joy whenever he comes over theres no escape room that only has one skylight window since old nick is only one who knows numbers combination lock enter jack is born as result old nick violating joy its her son thats only thing keeping her alive child does remarkably well despite growing up such deprived environment joy teaches jack how make birthday cake he plays with limited amount objects found room occasionally old nick might bring boy present such as electric model car there are course tensions between mother son joy doesnt react well when jack throws tantrum example best part picture is way which joy jack are rescued this abominable situation but unfortunately its not all that believable joys plan is have jack pretend that hes dead instruct him how escape inside rolled up rug after old nick drives away his pickup dispose body entire escape is predicated old nicks decision not check see if jack is really dead as scene plays out old nick inexplicably backs off after joy screams at him not look at jack because as she explains it him she cant stomach idea pervert touching her dead son subsequent way which jack miraculously escapes old nicks truck heart pounding way which police figure out where little boy came make up slow moving turn events act one second half room does not have rising tension found first focus how all family members adjust is what second half act two is all about joy returns home find her mother nancy divorced her father robert now married leo there is underdeveloped subplot involving robert who is repulsed by idea that jack was conceived through rape that his father was pervert old nick robert goes home out state residence his catalog resentments remain unexplored better subplot involves intrusion media upon joy rest family joy agrees give interview reporter money she asks her painful questions about what went with old nick whether she made right decision raising jack depriving him normal childhood suggestion is made that she could have convinced old nick leave newborn jack anonymously at hospital conflict develops between joy nancy eventually theres rather predictable trope joy attempting suicide most critics found jacks acclimation his new found world be touching cathartic when he bonds with leos dog new pal next door all seems right with world even joy is seen getting herself together at films end so what is one think all this its story that i suppose holds ones interest end although central twist i e escape feels contrived while young jacob tremblay did fine job playing jack his successful adjustment outside world feels me much more schematic than cathartic as many critics insist as brie larson calls her win oscar best actress seem misplaced although her performance is fine given pedestrian script end room rises level average lifetime movie with few interesting twists turns here there but more predictable elements making up bulk overall proceedings,0.35623376623376596,0.1828522727272728,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,brilliant performances,"In a small room, Ma (Brie Larson) is celebrating the fifth birthday of her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). There are no windows except for a skylight and no obvious door. Jack's understanding of the outside world is limited. It's soon obvious that they are prisoners of a man they called Old Nick. Ma finally tells Jack that her name is Joy Newsome and she was taken when she was 17 some 7 years ago. Jack angrily disbelieves at first. Joy comes up with a daring gamble to escape back to her parents (Joan Allen, William H. Macy).This is a star-making role for Brie Larson. Her performance in 'Short Term 12' is amazing but little seen. She once again delivers a top-notch performance. She has inner strength and humanity. Jacob Tremblay is a wonderful discovery with his squeaky little voice. It's an almost perfect little film. I was wondering where this movie was going at certain points in the middle but I think it ends in the perfect place.",brilliant performances,small room ma brie larson is celebrating fifth birthday her son jack jacob tremblay there are no windows except skylight no obvious door jacks understanding outside world is limited its soon obvious that they are prisoners man they called old nick ma finally tells jack that her name is joy newsome she was taken when she was 17 some 7 years ago jack angrily disbelieves at first joy comes up with daring gamble escape back her parents joan allen william h macy this is star making role brie larson her performance short term 12 is amazing but little seen she once again delivers top notch performance she has inner strength humanity jacob tremblay is wonderful discovery with his squeaky little voice its almost perfect little film i was wondering where this movie was going at certain points middle but i think it ends perfect place,0.4985714285714286,0.2312142857142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,Bored to Hell,"Sometimes there are these special movies - high ratings, lots of ppl loving them and you just wonder - is this the same movie Iam watching ppl are talking about!? I was just well bored, almost bored to a brain-killing stupor. The young kid played his role not bad but if I compare him with the little girl from the movie Hidden (I know, I know, different genres but at least the location/space/set for acting is comparable)- he's just okay. The one thing I was the whole time wondering - why the woman didn't just kill the guy in his sleep. Well I heard about Stockholm-Syndrome, but the woman didn't behave imo like a person with that ""kind of state"" would, but Iam no specialist here. Well, so many ppl praising and liking that movie so tbh they can't be all wrong - so just try that movie and see what kind of movie Room is for you. Btw - one very weak point of the movie is for me that I didn't attach to the mother and his son at all - I watched that movie with no sympathy nor dislike for them. Well, I rated it 1 because of all the legions of 10s, my ""real"" vote is a 4 but no more.I re-watched the movie and I must say I even do like it less, if it's possible. I realised why I don't like this movie at all: Room tells us the typical Love-Conquers-It-All-Narration but if u have ever known/met a person or worked with a person who was sexually or otherwise traumatically assaulted you know that just love doesn't heal everything. Lots of ppl just never really leave behind the trauma, the trauma is a big part of their life. So this movie is kinda Disney-life and has not much to do with real life. Room is the typical sugar-coated version (and the book also if it has the same conclusion) of a Love-Conquers-It-All-script - it happens in real life yes, but this kind of story is told countless times before on screen and in real life rare. Many real good stories hurt reading, but Hollywood gives you 9 times out of 10 cotton-candy at the end. So does Room. Btw - the boy almost shows no sign of disturbance in his behavior whatsoever. If u see pictures (or meet them in real life) of e.g. war-traumatized kids you understand how dumb this is. If I compare this movie to The Lovely Bones with Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz u also see that the actors are just mediocre. And whereas The Lovely Bones is really heartbreaking and got suspense and is told poetically superb, Room has nothing of it to offer. Or watch Chained with Vincent D'Onofrio as a sick, emotionally dead serial killer. To watch D'Onofrio's superb play was shocking good. And the relationship between Rabbit (Eamon Farren) and his captor Bob (D'Onofrio) beats everything Room provides easy. Chained is shocking good. Room is shocking naive and boring.",bored hell,sometimes there are these special movies high ratings lots ppl loving them you just wonder is this same movie iam watching ppl are talking about i was just well bored almost bored brain killing stupor young kid played his role not bad but if i compare him with little girl movie hidden i know i know different genres but at least location space set acting is comparable hes just okay one thing i was whole time wondering why woman didnt just kill guy his sleep well i heard about stockholm syndrome but woman didnt behave imo like person with that kind state would but iam no specialist here well so many ppl praising liking that movie so tbh they cant be all wrong so just try that movie see what kind movie room is you btw one very weak point movie is me that i didnt attach mother his son at all i watched that movie with no sympathy nor dislike them well i rated it 1 because all legions 10s my real vote is 4 but no more i re watched movie i must say i even do like it less if its possible i realised why i dont like this movie at all room tells us typical love conquers it all narration but if u have ever known met person or worked with person who was sexually or otherwise traumatically assaulted you know that just love doesnt heal everything lots ppl just never really leave behind trauma trauma is big part their life so this movie is kinda disney life has not much do with real life room is typical sugar coated version book also if it has same conclusion love conquers it all script it happens real life yes but this kind story is told countless times before screen real life rare many real good stories hurt reading but hollywood gives you 9 times out 10 cotton candy at end so does room btw boy almost shows no sign disturbance his behavior whatsoever if u see pictures or meet them real life e g war traumatized kids you understand how dumb this is if i compare this movie lovely bones with saoirse ronan mark wahlberg rachel weisz u also see that actors are just mediocre whereas lovely bones is really heartbreaking got suspense is told poetically superb room has nothing it offer or watch chained with vincent donofrio as sick emotionally dead serial killer watch donofrios superb play was shocking good relationship between rabbit eamon farren his captor bob donofrio beats everything room provides easy chained is shocking good room is shocking naive boring,0.6163613671274962,0.061605222734255,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8.0,2 great performances and a captivating story,"""Room"" is an American 2-hour movie from last year. The director is Lenny Abramson and writer is Emma Donoghue, who actually adapted her own novel for the screen with this one. Both scored Academy Award nominations for their work with the Best Director slot certainly being the more surprising feat. The movie also got in for Best Picture and won lead actress Brie Larsen an Oscar, just like basically all precursors. Jacob Tremblay, however, was the real lead here and it is absolutely ridiculous that he was nominated for so many supporting awards. Voice-overs are usually a good indicator who is in the center of the story and we hear him at the very beginning and end for example. Also there are key scenes where we still find out about him while his mother is out of the picture, such as the successful escape or after his mother tries to commit suicide. But this should not mean that Larson isn't lead. She is as well, but only the second lead despite being credited first.I believed this film delivered on many areas, such as emotion and drama most importantly. The escape inside the carpet was downright thrilling from start to finish until the very moment we realize he succeeded. But even the tension stays high as we do not know what happened to his mother. Did he kill her or not. The consequence of these scenes is also the emotion in here. The moments when Larson's character runs towards the car with her son inside is really moving and there are more scenes like that, such as the way they meet the grandparents or also the scene with the boy and the dog towards the end. You will be amazed by these and it is really difficult to hold the tears back.This is a very tragic, yet very uplifting film at the same time, but certainly more of the latter. The scenes early on in the prison do not seem as sad as they really are as we see everything through the eyes of the son. It starts right away inside the shack and I initially thought the woman actually has a mental disorder because of which she won't leave the place and the guy coming occasionally is somebody who provides them with the necessary items in exchange for sexual pleasure. It is seen a lot more as a prison when the action moves outside, which is roughly the entire second half of the film. I personally think that there are a couple scenes that don't add that much really and could have been left out. It is also difficult to say if this film had worked even better if it would have ended with the reunion of the two outside, but I guess it would have been a major (maybe impossible) challenge to make it work for 100 minutes or so. I guess it was best this way. Another flaw I saw with it was the attempted suicide scene I mentioned earlier already. It felt a bit unrealistic drama at this point. Yes it was all too much for her, but she fought for survival for 5 years and then she would do something like that. Of course, the reason was that she had doubts after the reporter asked her why she did not give up on her son inside. But this also would have been her surrender I guess as she certainly would never have gotten outside without him. But yeah, the way the press was depicted in here was generic and standard in a negative way. They could have dealt better with that situation.But despite these criticisms, these almost 120 minutes were a captivating watch and truly flew by. I can see why the Academy turned out to like it that much. Larson and Tremblay shine a lot and it was impossible to say who was better. Okay, I could have done without some parts I mentioned already and also the mother-daughter argument, but these are just minor flaws. In the grand scheme of things, this film worked extraordinarily well and was extremely tense and touching at the same time. I command you to check it out.
