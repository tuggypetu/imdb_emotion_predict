3.0,Enticing premise but terrible dialogue and writing ruin it,"M. Night Shyamalan is such a fascinating director, you never know what you're going to get with him. He has made some of the most memorable movies with the best twist in cinema history and he has made some of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's like a flip of a coin, the head is good and the tail is a bad movie situation. The premise of Old is ""A family on a tropical holiday who discover that the secluded beach where they are relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly reducing their entire lives into a single day"". So does Old (2021) land on heads or tails?Firstly, I love the idea and concept of this movie. The idea of a thriller and mystery story about a beach that ages people is such a unique concept. I also like the themes that are explored, such as people being too focused on the past or the future instead of the present, people's mortality and family dynamic changing with time. There are also some genuinely unnerving scenes, such as a surgery scene and some deaths that are just unsettling to watch. M Night also succeeds in creating a tense situation with the characters. They try a bunch of logical stuff to try and get off the island but it doesn't work so you're engaged on how they are going to get off the island. Additionally, some other characters are acting weird which makes creates a tense situation for our main leads. I also have to praise Alex Wolff and Thomasin McKenzie who play aged up versions of the kids. They have to maintain the young kid mentality which they certainly conveyed from their performance.However, every other actor just gives such an unconvincing performance with terrible delivery. The actors all give such a bland performance with barely any tone in their voice, like a robot. This is partially due to the terrible writing and dialogue. No one seems to speak like an actual normal human being which makes the movie very off-putting. Some dialogue is so cheesy that it is actually kind of funny, even though the scene is clearly not meant to be. There are some exposition scenes where the characters are in a circle and discussing what is going on, which is just ridiculous. A fair amount of the characters make points about what is going on that is definitely right but is something people would not logically jump to at first thought. M. Night also returns with a twist ending, if you could even call it that as it was quite predictable. The ending is very lacklustre and even ruins the tone that was set throughout by making the movie become something different instead.Overall, Old (2021) lands on the tail this time. By this point, I believe someone should let M. Night direct and create the ideas but not let him write the script whatsoever. It is still disappointing to see that even after all these years M. Night still doesn't understand how to write dialogue as Old is one of the worst in terms of dialogue. The enticing premise is able to keep you engaged but everything else is so poor that it's difficult to completely recommend this movie. Hopefully, next time M. Night is able to deliver a good movie because this is not it, unfortunately.",enticing premise but terrible dialogue writing ruin it,m night shyamalan is such fascinating director you never know what youre going get with him he has made some most memorable movies with best twist cinema history he has made some worst movies i have ever seen its like flip coin head is good tail is bad movie situation premise old is family tropical holiday who discover that secluded beach where they are relaxing few hours is somehow causing them age rapidly reducing their entire lives into single day so does old 2021 land heads or tails firstly i love idea concept this movie idea thriller mystery story about beach that ages people is such unique concept i also like themes that are explored such as people being too focused past or future instead present peoples mortality family dynamic changing with time there are also some genuinely unnerving scenes such as surgery scene some deaths that are just unsettling watch m night also succeeds creating tense situation with characters they try bunch logical stuff try get off island but it doesnt work so youre engaged how they are going get off island additionally some other characters are acting weird which makes creates tense situation our main leads i also have praise alex wolff thomasin mckenzie who play aged up versions kids they have maintain young kid mentality which they certainly conveyed their performance however every other actor just gives such unconvincing performance with terrible delivery actors all give such bland performance with barely any tone their voice like robot this is partially due terrible writing dialogue no one seems speak like actual normal human being which makes movie very off putting some dialogue is so cheesy that it is actually kind funny even though scene is clearly not meant be there are some exposition scenes where characters are circle discussing what is going which is just ridiculous fair amount characters make points about what is going that is definitely right but is something people would not logically jump at first thought m night also returns with twist ending if you could even call it that as it was quite predictable ending is very lacklustre even ruins tone that was set throughout by making movie become something different instead overall old 2021 lands tail this time by this point i believe someone should let m night direct create ideas but not let him write script whatsoever it is still disappointing see that even after all these years m night still doesnt understand how write dialogue as old is one worst terms dialogue enticing premise is able keep you engaged but everything else is so poor that its difficult completely recommend this movie hopefully next time m night is able deliver good movie because this is not it unfortunately,0.5081746031746032,-0.01061904761904762,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.44}"

,"Interesting Concept, Uninteresting Execution","The latest madcap offering from the filmmaker who has made a career out of coming up with truly insane & ambitious ideas over the years (whether he is able to make them work or not in execution being a whole another debate), Old finds the (in)famous writer-director once again experimenting with a crazy concept but the end result is a mixed bag as the film fails to make the most of what was up for grabs.Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs, The Village & The Visit), the story follows a group of tourists who find themselves ageing rapidly on a mysterious & secluded beach. With a lifetime passing in the matter of a single day for all the involved characters, the possibilities worth exploring are endless. However, Shyamalan's erratic direction & bland characterisation prevent the key events to blossom to their full capacity.There are nonetheless hints of brilliance scattered throughout the picture. It just never unifies into a satisfying whole. The rapid ageing & its debilitating effects is rather unsettling to watch but then the dialogues & performances are so idiotic & over-the-top that we aren't really sure what tone Shyamalan was going for. The film is silly yet serious, fun yet terrifying, thrilling yet amusing, ludicrous yet genius, and is often a cinematic ride of sharp contrasts.Overall, Old features a premise that not only exhibits promise & potential on paper but is also instantly appealing & downright ambitious. Still, Shyamalan is unable to explore his zany idea to its fullest by failing to weave a compelling narrative around it, thus resulting in a frustrating & confusing experience. He tries to do too much yet only ends up doing too little. All in all, Old has its merits & moments but the ride as a whole feels more or less underwhelming in the end.",interesting concept uninteresting execution,latest madcap offering filmmaker who has made career out coming up with truly insane ambitious ideas over years whether he is able make them work or not execution being whole another debate old finds famous writer director once again experimenting with crazy concept but end result is mixed bag as film fails make most what was up grabs written directed by m night shyamalan signs village visit story follows group tourists who find themselves ageing rapidly mysterious secluded beach with lifetime passing matter single day all involved characters possibilities worth exploring are endless however shyamalans erratic direction bland characterisation prevent key events blossom their full capacity there are nonetheless hints brilliance scattered throughout picture it just never unifies into satisfying whole rapid ageing its debilitating effects is rather unsettling watch but then dialogues performances are so idiotic over top that we arent really sure what tone shyamalan was going film is silly yet serious fun yet terrifying thrilling yet amusing ludicrous yet genius is often cinematic ride sharp contrasts overall old features premise that not only exhibits promise potential paper but is also instantly appealing downright ambitious still shyamalan is unable explore his zany idea its fullest by failing weave compelling narrative around it thus resulting frustrating confusing experience he tries do too much yet only ends up doing too little all all old has its merits moments but ride as whole feels more or less underwhelming end,0.6059446000622469,0.02858309990662932,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.43}"
6.0,like the idea,"Guy (Gael García Bernal) and his family have been given an exotic resort vacation. They and other guests are brought to a secluded closed beach. Soon, they realize that the kids are growing older by years and nobody can escape.Like a lot of M. Night Shyamalan movies, he has a fascinating idea and a twist. The idea is really good. The twist explains some of the idea but in reality, it's not actually necessary. It would be more compelling to have the group stumble upon a mini Bermuda triangle from which no one can escape. As for the group, I do have an issue with them not doing everything to try to escape. They often feel stuck by their own inaction. The only one truly figuring out stuff seems to be Jarin. What got me is when Kara tries to climb out. Instead of helping, almost everyone is trying to stop her and stop Trent from joining her. First of all, one of the adults should have tried climbing before then. I also wonder why they don't try to tie together a rope or MacGyver something. The pool noodles are meant to be funny but I just wondered why that's the first time we're shown them. Then there is the passing out bit. The story yadayada a lot of that away. Nevertheless, I still like the idea. It's a fun Twilight Zone episode. M. Night continues to do the twist at the end and this one is fine. This is interesting.",like idea,guy gael garc bernal his family have been given exotic resort vacation they other guests are brought secluded closed beach soon they realize that kids are growing older by years nobody can escape like lot m night shyamalan movies he has fascinating idea twist idea is really good twist explains some idea but reality its not actually necessary it would be more compelling have group stumble upon mini bermuda triangle which no one can escape as group i do have issue with them not doing everything try escape they often feel stuck by their own inaction only one truly figuring out stuff seems be jarin what got me is when kara tries climb out instead helping almost everyone is trying stop her stop trent joining her first all one adults should have tried climbing before then i also wonder why they dont try tie together rope or macgyver something pool noodles are meant be funny but i just wondered why thats first time were shown them then there is passing out bit story yadayada lot that away nevertheless i still like idea its fun twilight zone episode m night continues do twist at end this one is fine this is interesting,0.5644736842105263,0.2662280701754386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
7.0,An enjoyable movie.,"I have read several really bad reviews about this film, and the last film or two I watched from Shyamalan were average at best, but there was something about this film that I did enjoy.It flew by, it wasn't slow or dull, nor was it particularly scary, instead it relies on the primal fears many have (self included) about the ageing process, and the passing of time, if you are someone who has the slightest worry of time passing, this will resonate.The location work is awesome, and the production values are superb. Great acting throughout, it's always great to see Rufus Sewell's cheekbones.Not sure if it was my ears, but I found some of the dialogue a little muffled at times.All in all, this was good, 7/10.",enjoyable movie,i have read several really bad reviews about this film last film or two i watched shyamalan were average at best but there was something about this film that i did enjoy it flew by it wasnt slow or dull nor was it particularly scary instead it relies primal fears many have self included about ageing process passing time if you are someone who has slightest worry time passing this will resonate location work is awesome production values are superb great acting throughout its always great see rufus sewells cheekbones not sure if it was my ears but i found some dialogue little muffled at times all all this was good 7 10,0.5485380116959064,0.2274122807017544,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
3.0,Your character motivation? Stare blankly.,"Typical M. Night film, interesting concept with poor execution, poor writing/character motivations, and a few WTF absurd moments.Plot holes? Yeah, we got em! Here are a few notable ones I noticed:-They mention nails and hair don't grow rapidly due the cells already being dead in them. Okay. Then why did all the dead bodies rapidly decompose?-The fact that these 6-11 year old kids made the connection from that word puzzle that they should swim thru the coral was extremely far fetched.-The 2 6-year old kids...did it? Really? In like 2 minutes?-Apparently you can perform MAJOR abdominal surgery to remove a huge tumor with a hunting knife and it'll just be no problem at all?-You're telling me 72 previous groups went missing on their vacations and it NEVER led back to this place? No questions asked by hundreds of loved ones?I don't think the actors in this film are actually that bad of actors, I just think M. Night had such horrible direction for them they seemed bad. Way too many sequences of people just...standing there and starting. A multitude of accents all speaking at once. Or how about all the nice weird camera angles in an attempt to create fake suspense?All this wouldn't have ruined the film for me by itself, until the film just fell in on itself towards the end.The knife slashing insane guy who was very clumsily ""fighting"" the lead protagonist? Or his model wife...twisting herself into a pretzel because she had a calcium deficiency? No. Sorry Mr. Night, nothing like that would be remotely physically possible, even in the context of this film.

4.0,Messy direction,"OLD (2021) is another M. Night Shyamalan film spoilt by his over the top direction. I love THE SIXTH SENSE and there are others in his filmography I like too, but he seems to miss more often than he hits. This one tells the story of a cursed beach that causes anyone who visits it to age rapidly, and it's a neat premise that would have worked well in an episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE or somesuch. But in Shyamalan's hands this is a mess, with awkward and stilted performances, too many uninteresting characters standing around and chatting or just doing nothing, and a ""twist"" ending only included because the running time comes up short. As for the ""inventive"", anything-goes camerawork...give me a break!",messy direction,old 2021 is another m night shyamalan film spoilt by his over top direction i love sixth sense there are others his filmography i like too but he seems miss more often than he hits this one tells story cursed beach that causes anyone who visits it age rapidly its neat premise that would have worked well episode twilight zone or somesuch but shyamalans hands this is mess with awkward stilted performances too many uninteresting characters standing around chatting or just doing nothing twist ending only included because running time comes up short as inventive anything goes camerawork give me break,0.5613636363636364,0.14772727272727273,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.2, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
3.0,A Cool Concept that Goes Nowhere,"M. Night Shyamalan has been a director I have admired, but have only connected with a couple of times. Nearly every movie buff praises his film The Sixth Sense as his best, and rightfully so. It's definitely up there for me, but his grounded work with Unbreakable is truly his crown jewel to me. He then had his string of blockbusters like The Last Airbender, After Earth, and The Happening. This is when everyone began to realize his heydays were over. With that said, his return with The Visit, Split, and Glass were all very commendable. For that reason alone, I had some newfound excitement for his next project. Old is now playing in theatres and here are my honest thoughts on what is easily one of Shyamalan's worst films.The concept of this film is quite simple. A family on vacation is invited to a secret beach for relaxation. Joined by a few others, everyone realizes that there is more to this location than meets the eye. As they all begin to rapidly age, their children are now teenagers within hours and some of their health conditions also rapidly return. The first act of this film is very intriguing and it had me hooked, aside from the terrible dialogue. Even though the idea hooked me though, this is the prime example of a film that has a cool idea and never does anything with it.It was at about the halfway mark that I started wondering where this film was truly going because it never felt like it was building to anything. Yes, the mystery of this beach looms over the entire film, but again, the script never dives deep enough to really care about the events on-screen. On top of the fact that the script needed a lot of work in terms of plotting, the dialogue is also atrocious from beginning to end. I understood the fact that these actors had to act as if they were still young children, but none of what they were saying was either believable for that age or it ended up being too cheesy.One of my biggest problems with any film that sets itself up with a crazy concept is that it needs to focus on delivering at least some answers for its audience. A film that remains ambiguous can be amazing if the characters and story are all great enough to make that not important. Sadly, Old falls into the category of a film that delivers answers while also not really giving you enough to understand. I completely understood the point behind how the film concluded, but it was also quite dumb. Again, this is coming from someone who will always give an M. Night Shyamalan film the benefit of the doubt.In the end, Old has a few scenes that I really enjoyed. One scene in particular that I really latched onto was one that involved an elderly couple with dementia, but once again, I instantly forgot about it because it was poorly written. If this concept had been sold to someone else to write and direct, I feel like the reception of this film would've been much higher. It's a very neat idea that goes nowhere and the experience almost felt completely pointless to me. Still, I'll give some minor compliments to the overall concept and a couple of noteworthy scenes. Other than that, Old is easily one of the worst films I've seen in 2021.",cool concept that goes nowhere,m night shyamalan has been director i have admired but have only connected with couple times nearly every movie buff praises his film sixth sense as his best rightfully so its definitely up there me but his grounded work with unbreakable is truly his crown jewel me he then had his string blockbusters like last airbender after earth happening this is when everyone began realize his heydays were over with that said his return with visit split glass were all very commendable that reason alone i had some newfound excitement his next project old is now playing theatres here are my honest thoughts what is easily one shyamalans worst films concept this film is quite simple family vacation is invited secret beach relaxation joined by few others everyone realizes that there is more this location than meets eye as they all begin rapidly age their children are now teenagers within hours some their health conditions also rapidly return first act this film is very intriguing it had me hooked aside terrible dialogue even though idea hooked me though this is prime example film that has cool idea never does anything with it it was at about halfway mark that i started wondering where this film was truly going because it never felt like it was building anything yes mystery this beach looms over entire film but again script never dives deep enough really care about events screen top fact that script needed lot work terms plotting dialogue is also atrocious beginning end i understood fact that these actors had act as if they were still young children but none what they were saying was either believable that age or it ended up being too cheesy one my biggest problems with any film that sets itself up with crazy concept is that it needs focus delivering at least some answers its audience film that remains ambiguous can be amazing if characters story are all great enough make that not important sadly old falls into category film that delivers answers while also not really giving you enough understand i completely understood point behind how film concluded but it was also quite dumb again this is coming someone who will always give m night shyamalan film benefit doubt end old has few scenes that i really enjoyed one scene particular that i really latched onto was one that involved elderly couple with dementia but once again i instantly forgot about it because it was poorly written if this concept had been sold someone else write direct i feel like reception this film wouldve been much higher its very neat idea that goes nowhere experience almost felt completely pointless me still ill give some minor compliments overall concept couple noteworthy scenes other than that old is easily one worst films ive seen 2021,0.5168442292171104,0.01564971751412431,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.45}"
4.0,You might find yourself wishing away the time watching this one.,"M. Night Shyalaman's directorial career skyrocketed with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but the majority of his subsequent movies have failed to match the impact of those two films. His 'Twilight Zone'-style storytelling got old really quick.Which brings me to Old, in which a group of vacationers at an exclusive resort visit a private beach where they rapidly age, a novel idea that might have suited an episode of a TV show but which feels like a lifetime in movie form. Once the viewer has an understanding of what is happening to the characters, the plot goes nowhere for an age until the director eventually reveals his obligatory twist in the final act.It doesn't help that the script for the film is rather laughable, with the poor cast having to deliver some atrocious dialogue. Shyalaman's direction also feels 'off' throughout the film, perhaps as an attempt to increase the unsettling atmosphere, but all it did was make me question his film-making decisions.Perhaps if the revelation at the end had been a real doozy, I might have been a bit more forgiving of the preceding nonsense, but the whole corporate conspiracy concept felt like a rather lazy way to wrap things up.4/10, solely for entertaining me with its stupidity, which isn't really much of a recommendation.",you might find yourself wishing away time watching this one,m night shyalamans directorial career skyrocketed with sixth sense unbreakable but majority his subsequent movies have failed match impact those two films his twilight zone style storytelling got old really quick which brings me old which group vacationers at exclusive resort visit private beach where they rapidly age novel idea that might have suited episode tv show but which feels like lifetime movie form once viewer has understanding what is happening characters plot goes nowhere age until director eventually reveals his obligatory twist final act it doesnt help that script film is rather laughable with poor cast having deliver some atrocious dialogue shyalamans direction also feels off throughout film perhaps as attempt increase unsettling atmosphere but all it did was make me question his film making decisions perhaps if revelation at end had been real doozy i might have been bit more forgiving preceding nonsense but whole corporate conspiracy concept felt like rather lazy way wrap things up 4 10 solely entertaining me with its stupidity which isnt really much recommendation,0.5276315789473683,-0.06929824561403508,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.24, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
6.0,The Anxiety Of Aging,"For those of you who claim to blink one day and your whole life is behind you, this movie may give you major anxiety. The story is of a mysterious island where certain visitors are chosen and carted off to a special place where you age quickly. By quickly the math turns out to be 3 hours would equal 10 years. Having discovered this phenomenon too late the ""castaways"" soon become desperate in trying to find the escape path. If there is one.It's a tragic story of (sometimes) undeserving victims. As if the mysterious resort is giving human sacrifices to appease the God of Youth. Instead it's something a little more than that. If you've seen ""The Village"" you get an inkling of it. In the short amount of time surrounding these poor souls...much is discussed. Regret, love, forgiveness. In that message of ""say the important things to the ones you love before it's too late"" this seems to hang over its head. The rest is just typical Shymalan. Depending on where you sit with him. It may grate on you.I will say this.... I stumbled upon watching this in a room full of, what looked to be, teenage girls. They were silent the entire time. My guess: trying to unfold the mystery. To that, I would say it's a win.",anxiety aging,those you who claim blink one day your whole life is behind you this movie may give you major anxiety story is mysterious island where certain visitors are chosen carted off special place where you age quickly by quickly math turns out be 3 hours would equal 10 years having discovered this phenomenon too late castaways soon become desperate trying find escape path if there is one its tragic story sometimes undeserving victims as if mysterious resort is giving human sacrifices appease god youth instead its something little more than that if youve seen village you get inkling it short amount time surrounding these poor souls much is discussed regret love forgiveness that message say important things ones you love before its too late this seems hang over its head rest is just typical shymalan depending where you sit with him it may grate you i will say this i stumbled upon watching this room full what looked be teenage girls they were silent entire time my guess trying unfold mystery that i would say its win,0.5363520408163265,0.046896258503401365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"
6.0,Dafter than the Dharma initiative.,"""Old"" is the latest from the gloriously inconsistent writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. Will this be great Shyamalan (à la ""The Sixth Sense"") or dire Shyamalan (à la ""The Last Airbender"")? The answer, in my view, is somewhere in the middle. It's a curate's egg of a movie.Positives: The premise feels very familiar (desert island beach; time slips; weird things happening.... ""Lost"" anyone?). But as a shell for a big-screen adventure it kept me well-engaged.Shyamalan and his ""Glass"" cinematographer Mike Gioulakis use some novel techniques to portray the ageing effects. The angles used feel quite Hitchcockian at times. Shyamalan supports this with the sound design, which makes this a REALLY good movie to watch in a cinema with good surround sound. Often the camera will be spinning showing nothing but ocean or rocks, with the character's conversation rotating behind you in the cinema. It's really quite effective.Shyamalan knows that no visual effects can improve on the horrors your mind can come up with. Although a '15' certificate, the ""sustained threat, strong violence and injury detail"" referenced by the BBFC pales into insignificance (in terms of what you actually see) compared to the equally rated ""Freaky"".I've seen other reviews comment that the ""twist"" (no spoilers here) was obvious. But, although not a ground-breaking idea, I was sufficiently satisfied with the denouement. It made sense, albeit twisted sense.Negatives: I enjoyed the movie's leisurely set-up, introducing the characters and the movie's concept. (In many ways, it felt like the start of one of Irwin Allen's disaster movies of the 70's and 80's). But then Shyamalan turns the dial up to 11 and the action becomes increasingly farcical. Add into that the fact that you can see some of the 'jolts' coming a mile off, and the movie becomes progressively more disappointing, with a high ERQ (eye-rolling quotient) by the end.In particular, there are inconsistencies to the story that get you asking uncomfortable questions. For example, wounds can heal in the blink of an eye.... but not stab wounds apparently.The cast is truly global in nature: Vicky (""Phantom Thread"") Krieps hails from Luxembourg; Bernal is Mexican; Sewell is a Brit; Amuka-Bird (""David Copperfield"") is Nigerian; Leung is American; Eliza Scanlan is an Aussie; and Thomasin McKenzie (so good in ""Jojo Rabbit"", and good here too) is a Kiwi. But although it's clearly quite natural that an exotic beach resort would attract guests from all over the world, the combination of accents here makes the whole thing unfortunately sound like a dodgy spaghetti western!Summary Thoughts: 'Time' and 'ageing' have of course been a popular movie topic for many years. I remember being both gripped and horrified by George Pal's wonderful 1960's version of ""The Time Machine"" when Rod Taylor threw his machine into fast forward and the dead Morlock decomposed in front of his eyes! Ursula Andress did the same as the rapidly ageing Ayesha in 1965's ""She"". And, more recently and with better effects, Julian Glover did the same in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".Unfortunately, ""Old"" isn't likely to join any of these classic movies in my consciousness. It's a diverting enough movie, with fabulous views of the Dominican Republic (which the local tourist board will no doubt be delighted with). A ""less is more"" approach might have made this a classic. But unfortunately, that's not what Shyamalan delivered here. Since what we get is a 'Lost-lite' with farcical elements.And, by the way....

6.0,"Entertaining, but not Outstanding","Shamaylan seems to be one of those directors whose films make money despite the fact that the critics don't seem to be all that impressed with them. Okay, he has had one massive flop, which happened to be The Last Airbender, but other than that he seems to continue to churn out films, and those films continue to make money. The other thing is that he seems to be one of those directors that has a lot more control over his films, and yeah, there are a few of them that fall into that category.I won't say that this film has a twist though, and when people do use the word twist in the film it is put in quotes. It's sort of more of a reveal, and I have to admit that it is pretty difficult to go one better than the 'Bruce Willis is a ghost' twist that pretty much left everybody gaping in The Sixth Sense. Still, it wasn't too bad, even though I can't say that I am a particularly big fan of his films.So, the story is about a family that goes on a vacation to an island resort, and the owner of the resort suggests that they go on a trip to a secluded beach. However, they aren't the only ones that are going to the beach, and when they get there they discover that things don't seem to be all that great, particularly since they discover a body, and then an elderly lady with them just dies. What becomes apparent though is that people seem to age much faster than normal, and I note that there is a mention that the reason they have a lot of food is because there are children with them.I'm not sure how I would categorise this film, though Shamalyan does like his supernatural thrillers. I don't necessarily want to call them horror though because they don't seem to fall into that category, even though I consider horror films to be much more than your typical hack and slash/blood and gore type films that people seem to equate with horror (which I actually don't consider to be horror films, but that is just me).Anyway, it isn't particularly bad, but I wouldn't be putting it up there amongst some of my favourite films, though I do have to admit that I did like the premise - to an extent. I guess the thing that I did have an issue with was that the children, while physically ageing, also seemed to not only mentally age, but also gain knowledge as well - namely with being able to communicate as an adult as opposed to being an adult, but talking as a child. I guess the reason this irritated me is because language, and communication, happens to be a learned trait, not something that is biological that develops as one physically develops. Still, other than that, it wasn't bad.",entertaining but not outstanding,shamaylan seems be one those directors whose films make money despite fact that critics dont seem be all that impressed with them okay he has had one massive flop which happened be last airbender but other than that he seems continue churn out films those films continue make money other thing is that he seems be one those directors that has lot more control over his films yeah there are few them that fall into that category i wont say that this film has twist though when people do use word twist film it is put quotes its sort more reveal i have admit that it is pretty difficult go one better than bruce willis is ghost twist that pretty much left everybody gaping sixth sense still it wasnt too bad even though i cant say that i am particularly big fan his films so story is about family that goes vacation island resort owner resort suggests that they go trip secluded beach however they arent only ones that are going beach when they get there they discover that things dont seem be all that great particularly since they discover body then elderly lady with them just dies what becomes apparent though is that people seem age much faster than normal i note that there is mention that reason they have lot food is because there are children with them im not sure how i would categorise this film though shamalyan does like his supernatural thrillers i dont necessarily want call them horror though because they dont seem fall into that category even though i consider horror films be much more than your typical hack slash blood gore type films that people seem equate with horror which i actually dont consider be horror films but that is just me anyway it isnt particularly bad but i wouldnt be putting it up there amongst some my favourite films though i do have admit that i did like premise extent i guess thing that i did have issue with was that children while physically ageing also seemed not only mentally age but also gain knowledge as well namely with being able communicate as adult as opposed being adult but talking as child i guess reason this irritated me is because language communication happens be learned trait not something that is biological that develops as one physically develops still other than that it wasnt bad,0.537906746031746,0.06979166666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.42, 'Fear': 0.14}"

3.0,M. Night Shyamalan strikes out again...,"Wow. Just wow.This movie was laughably bad. There were so insanely many plot holes and things that made absolutely no sense in this movie, that it got more and more progressively difficult to take the movie seriously, much less enjoy the narrative, as the movie trotted on. I just ended up shaking my head in disbelieve throughout the course of this atrocity of a movie, and you can't help but roll your eyes at this attempt of making a mystery thriller.The storyline told in ""Old"", while it certainly had an interesting concept, just fell short of being entertaining, and it was increasingly becoming more and more of a struggle to sit through the ordeal that is ""Old"". And believe you me, this is definitely not a movie that I would recommend you rush out to spend your time, money or effort on.Sure, the acting performances in the movie were adequate, and there were some talented performers on the cast list. But they had precious little to work with in terms of a proper script, and it was restricting their performances.The character gallery in ""Old"" was interesting enough, but again, too many things just made no sense, which ended up reflecting poorly on the characters, due to some seriously inferior writing.I was lured in to watch ""Old"", given the movie's poster and its interesting enough synopsis. But with it being an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I can't really claim that I was thrilled or having much of any expectations, as I haven't exactly been a fan of his movies.""Old"" was a dud, another swing and a miss in the track record of Mr. M.
