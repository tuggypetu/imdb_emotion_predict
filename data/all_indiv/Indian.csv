10.0,"A must see film for all audiences, Indian and foreign","Indian was clearly director Shankar's magnum opum and India's entry for the Oscar. This utterly brilliant and gripping film explores the horror of bureaucracy, corruption and bribery in modern India and its effect on society. Even locals themselves will be shocked as reality reflects on their TV screens in this movie. Whats shocking is the quality of the flashback footage in sepia of the colonial times where Indian rebels fought against the British. Such superb quality, story and acting is truly not seen anywhere else in any Indian-made film. However, as an entry for the Oscars, it would need some polishing up. I highly regret not seeing this film in the theatre when it originally released.

8.0,The lone crusader against corruption in India,"Producer and actor Kamal Haasan dealt with the burning issue of corruption in his movie Hindustani (1996) which was originally made in Tamil as Indian (and also released in Telugu under the title - Bhaaratheeyudu.Hindustani (Indian) is the story of an aged Indian freedom fighter - Senapati (Kamal Haasan) who has shed his perspiration and blood for the motherland during the struggle fro freedom from the British rule, remained a soldier in the Indian National Army led by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and married a girl (Sukanya) by saving her honour. Now in free India, he is peacefully living with his daughter (Kasturi) and son (Kamal Haasan's double role). The thing which changed the course of his life is the corruption rampant in the Indian system of governance. His daughter passed away for want of medical aid because he refused to pay bribes to the doctors, the cops and the people holding chairs in the system and not ready to move a finger till their pockets are warmed. The loss of his beloved daughter got followed up by the separation of his son named as Chandru who feels that his father is sticking to his outdated ideals and not moulding with time and that only resulted in the death of his beloved sister.Chandru becomes a corrupt person by all means and grabs a creamy (from corruption viewpoint) job in the Regional Transport Office, warming his pocket through bribes. On the other hand, Senapati gets a mission for the remaining part of his life. And that mission is a crusade against the corrupt who rule the roost in India, rendering agony and injustice to the innocent commoners every day, every hour, every minute. Now the lone crusader Senapati starts ruthlessly killing the corrupt government servants and thus sending a message far and wide that any corrupt government servant won't be able to survive his attack. This mysterious killer is now trailed by a dedicated cop (Nedumudi Venu). Chandru amidst his romances with Aishwarya (Manisha Koiraala) and Sapna (Urmila Maatondkar) is going ahead with his corruption-soaked life till a lethal accident takes place leading to death of many children. Now Senapati comes to know that his own blood is no better than the other corrupt people sucking the blood of the masses in every nook and corner of India. Can he spare Chandru just because he is his son ?Hindustani is a movie whose story comes straight from the heart of a person who has devoted his heart and soul to his motherland but found that post-independence, all the ideals and values that he had fought for, have been thrown by his countrymen into the Indian Ocean. No regard is left for truth, no regard for justice, no regard for honesty, no regard for humanity and sensitivity. Greed for corrupt wealth has turned the Indians into stone-hearted fellows for whom money supersedes over everything noble, just and human. The Indian offices are studded by parasites more, human-beings less. And the collusion of the corrupt reigns from the bottom of the hierarchy to the top of it. Freedom fighters leave for their heavenly abodes one after another as their age takes over them. And the surviving ones keep on weeping at the abasement of the nation and more so of the people those populate it. We did not fight for the freedom of our motherland and hence the pinch is felt relatively less by us, we get used to the corruption and degeneration of values and adjust with the same. But how can a person soaked in the ideals of patriotism and truthfulness tolerate it and if he can, to which extent ? And thus the freedom-fighter of this story raises arm to launch another freedom struggle in which the adversaries are his compatriots only.Director Shankar has directed his own story very well but only to the extent it shows Senapati (both young and old) and his activities. When it comes to the activities of Senapati's young son Chandru, the movie appears to be no better than a regular Masaala movie made in India. Songs, dances, romance, comedy; everything is unnecessarily imposed on the main story which is sensible and sensitive. It's a digression from the main track which could have been and should have been avoided. Either you make a hard-hitting movie or you make a Masaala entertainer. When you make a two-in-one of them, you do nothing but dilute the quality of your product, reducing it from excellent to good. And that's where the director - Shankar has disappointed.Performance wise talkiing, Kamal Haasan takes the cake. He has done an excellent job especially as the old Senapati and quite sensibly has donned the wrinkled face to bring perfection to the persona being presented on the screen. He has done well as the young son of also but the image that remains in the heart after the movie is that of the aged father only, the lone crusader against corruption.With my highest regards to the fictional Senapati of this movie, I will support every such person who undertake such a mission to eliminate the corrupt. However at the same time, I also underscore that killing eliminates the corrupt individual and not the corrupt mentality which has spread across the length and width of our country like poison dissolved in a pond. The permanent and long lasting solution is something else - inculcate moral values and ethics in our young ones and go for character building of the generation next.",lone crusader against corruption india,producer actor kamal haasan dealt with burning issue corruption his movie hindustani 1996 which was originally made tamil as indian also released telugu under title bhaaratheeyudu hindustani indian is story aged indian freedom fighter senapati kamal haasan who has shed his perspiration blood motherland during struggle fro freedom british rule remained soldier indian national army led by netaji subhash chandra bose married girl sukanya by saving her honour now free india he is peacefully living with his daughter kasturi son kamal haasans double role thing which changed course his life is corruption rampant indian system governance his daughter passed away want medical aid because he refused pay bribes doctors cops people holding chairs system not ready move finger till their pockets are warmed loss his beloved daughter got followed up by separation his son named as chandru who feels that his father is sticking his outdated ideals not moulding with time that only resulted death his beloved sister chandru becomes corrupt person by all means grabs creamy corruption viewpoint job regional transport office warming his pocket through bribes other hand senapati gets mission remaining part his life that mission is crusade against corrupt who rule roost india rendering agony injustice innocent commoners every day every hour every minute now lone crusader senapati starts ruthlessly killing corrupt government servants thus sending message far wide that any corrupt government servant wont be able survive his attack this mysterious killer is now trailed by dedicated cop nedumudi venu chandru amidst his romances with aishwarya manisha koiraala sapna urmila maatondkar is going ahead with his corruption soaked life till lethal accident takes place leading death many children now senapati comes know that his own blood is no better than other corrupt people sucking blood masses every nook corner india can he spare chandru just because he is his son hindustani is movie whose story comes straight heart person who has devoted his heart soul his motherland but found that post independence all ideals values that he had fought have been thrown by his countrymen into indian ocean no regard is left truth no regard justice no regard honesty no regard humanity sensitivity greed corrupt wealth has turned indians into stone hearted fellows whom money supersedes over everything noble just human indian offices are studded by parasites more human beings less collusion corrupt reigns bottom hierarchy top it freedom fighters leave their heavenly abodes one after another as their age takes over them surviving ones keep weeping at abasement nation more so people those populate it we did not fight freedom our motherland hence pinch is felt relatively less by us we get used corruption degeneration values adjust with same but how can person soaked ideals patriotism truthfulness tolerate it if he can which extent thus freedom fighter this story raises arm launch another freedom struggle which adversaries are his compatriots only director shankar has directed his own story very well but only extent it shows senapati both young old his activities when it comes activities senapatis young son chandru movie appears be no better than regular masaala movie made india songs dances romance comedy everything is unnecessarily imposed main story which is sensible sensitive its digression main track which could have been should have been avoided either you make hard hitting movie or you make masaala entertainer when you make two one them you do nothing but dilute quality your product reducing it excellent good thats where director shankar has disappointed performance wise talkiing kamal haasan takes cake he has done excellent job especially as old senapati quite sensibly has donned wrinkled face bring perfection persona being presented screen he has done well as young son also but image that remains heart after movie is that aged father only lone crusader against corruption with my highest regards fictional senapati this movie i will support every such person who undertake such mission eliminate corrupt however at same time i also underscore that killing eliminates corrupt individual not corrupt mentality which has spread across length width our country like poison dissolved pond permanent long lasting solution is something else inculcate moral values ethics our young ones go character building generation next,0.5734220907297828,0.0497863247863248,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,a big ENTERTAINMENT from Kamal,"I highly recommend to watch this movie for two type of audiences- first, those who expect a good thriller from Indian cinema (of course not only Bollywood) and second, those who have only heard Kamal Hassan's name but never watched his any single movie yet. Kamal parts here dual role, one as an old man (Senapathy) who stops the corrupted people, and the other as his son (Chandru) who works in transport department concerning licenses. Kamal did brilliant job in this movie by offering both the roles of a father and a son. Perhaps, if examined clearly this is his career reflecting movie. There are some high definition visual scenes where we can see the real freedom fighters like Subash Chandra Bose and Senapathy together. This is a remarkable work from director Shankar, or say in Indian cinema. His directorial works are highly appreciable. For action lovers also this movie is a good reference.In romantic words, this is a love-triangle movie due to the presence of Manisha Koirala and Urmila Matondkar, both who love the same Chandru. They did their own works, and run the movie. But again, this movie falls under three categories- thriller, political (mixed with social) and patriotic as the title itself denotes. I watched countless times, but never felt bored as it is highly entertaining for the three hours continuously. It has two versions, original one in Tamil and another in dubbed Hindi version. In Hindi version there is a slight uneasiness with the uttering words of the actors in their lips as those do not match exactly, since it is a dubbed version.",big entertainment kamal,i highly recommend watch this movie two type audiences first those who expect good thriller indian cinema course not only bollywood second those who have only heard kamal hassans name but never watched his any single movie yet kamal parts here dual role one as old man senapathy who stops corrupted people other as his son chandru who works transport department concerning licenses kamal did brilliant job this movie by offering both roles father son perhaps if examined clearly this is his career reflecting movie there are some high definition visual scenes where we can see real freedom fighters like subash chandra bose senapathy together this is remarkable work director shankar or say indian cinema his directorial works are highly appreciable action lovers also this movie is good reference romantic words this is love triangle movie due presence manisha koirala urmila matondkar both who love same chandru they did their own works run movie but again this movie falls under three categories thriller political mixed with social patriotic as title itself denotes i watched countless times but never felt bored as it is highly entertaining three hours continuously it has two versions original one tamil another dubbed hindi version hindi version there is slight uneasiness with uttering words actors their lips as those do not match exactly since it is dubbed version,0.457626050420168,0.17794817927170867,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,Great,"Probably one of Kamal Hassan's best movies ever. It has a good story line to it, different from the usual Indian movies. For once there is no real bad guy in the movie. Yup that is true; the movie shows the evils in the society, which is the society itself.The cinematography is the movie is great. The locations are too. If there would be anything I would recommend is that to drop the songs, thought they are great and part of Indian movie culture, it really takes away the seriousness from the movie.The makeup is the movie is great, kamal really does look like someone that is that old. The fight scenes look just as cheesy as they usually do in any Indian movie.But hey it is great entertainment for the family. PS. Do not try the stunts in the movie at home.",great,probably one kamal hassans best movies ever it has good story line it different usual indian movies once there is no real bad guy movie yup that is true movie shows evils society which is society itself cinematography is movie is great locations are too if there would be anything i would recommend is that drop songs thought they are great part indian movie culture it really takes away seriousness movie makeup is movie is great kamal really does look like someone that is that old fight scenes look just as cheesy as they usually do any indian movie but hey it is great entertainment family ps do not try stunts movie at home,0.5277777777777779,0.3614583333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.23}"

7.0,a really required serial killer!,"Hindustani is a movie about a man who loses his daughter to the condition that is aroused as a result of corrupt officials. He wants to get things done the right way, but he realizes is that the officials could have prevented only if they cared for a person's life. The result of this he becomes a serial killer of corrupt officials. The movie also contains story of his wife and son and women who he likes. She is a blue cross society member, thus an animal lover. Sadly his son chose's wrong means for his development just like those corrupt officials. This results in ending which shows son killed by his own father.It is very much true that some people will get better only if nourished with fear. I liked the way how character of Hindustani is constructed. He used to be a freedom fighter who was expert in a fighting art from ancient India, thus capable of killing a person easily. I did not like the masala part which included his son much. I wanted to see more of Hindustani. I liked the way how his justice prevailed even against his family members. He punished his own son for being corrupt, thus setting a new level of fear which was on par despite of any government policy.

7.0,Freedom fighter goes on a stabbing spree in drive against corruption,"Kamal Hassan under the pseudonym Indian goes on a stabbing spree after the death of his only daughter. His aim to wipe out corruption in the Nation ends in a thrilling climax in which he has to kill his son, also played by Kamal.The movie, most noticed for its use of prosthetic make-up, graphics and an national award winning performance from Kamal, became a huge blockbuster of 90s Tamil cinema.Director Shankar, riding on a wave of success after his debut Gentleman and Kaadalan, cast Kamal in one of most expensive Tamil movies ever made. Song sequences filled with graphics, flamboyant costumes and stunning cinematography by Jeeva were balanced with a lengthy flashback of the Indian freedom movement against Britain, where Senapathy, played by Kamal, joins Subash Chandra Bose in a Forest Gump-like sequence.Malayalam actor Nedumudi Venu plays a cop investigating the serial killings committed by Senapathy, who comes back from a retired life as a farmer to once again free India of corruption. His son, Chandru, meanwhile has also turned corrupt and shockingly becomes an accomplice to the death of entire bus full of children.A couple of aspects of the movie stood out. Kamal's stunning performance, AR Rehman's music (he hit back at critics of his background score as well) and Jeeva's cinematography especially in the song sequences.Shankar makes the message of the movie so loud and the violence graphic (though not much blood on camera) that this almost kills the movie. Dialogues by Tamil writer Sujatha while being quite superficial suited the film to a T. Almost all actors expect Kamal, who is there in almost every frame, play two dimensional, superficial characters except for Nedumuni Venu, who performs his role with effortless ease that almost looks like he is being careless.The series of confrontations through the movie between the principled, though murderous father and the corrupt son form the crux of the movie. The characters are actually presenting the two sides of the debate on corruption, but this is cleverly written into the script. When performed by Kamal, these lines become more intense that they actually are involving the viewer in the story rather than its message. If only Shankar could learn to be a little more subtle.",freedom fighter goes stabbing spree drive against corruption,kamal hassan under pseudonym indian goes stabbing spree after death his only daughter his aim wipe out corruption nation ends thrilling climax which he has kill his son also played by kamal movie most noticed its use prosthetic make up graphics national award winning performance kamal became huge blockbuster 90s tamil cinema director shankar riding wave success after his debut gentleman kaadalan cast kamal one most expensive tamil movies ever made song sequences filled with graphics flamboyant costumes stunning cinematography by jeeva were balanced with lengthy flashback indian freedom movement against britain where senapathy played by kamal joins subash chandra bose forest gump like sequence malayalam actor nedumudi venu plays cop investigating serial killings committed by senapathy who comes back retired life as farmer once again free india corruption his son chandru meanwhile has also turned corrupt shockingly becomes accomplice death entire bus full children couple aspects movie stood out kamals stunning performance ar rehmans music he hit back at critics his background score as well jeevas cinematography especially song sequences shankar makes message movie so loud violence graphic though not much blood camera that this almost kills movie dialogues by tamil writer sujatha while being quite superficial suited film t almost all actors expect kamal who is there almost every frame play two dimensional superficial characters except nedumuni venu who performs his role with effortless ease that almost looks like he is being careless series confrontations through movie between principled though murderous father corrupt son form crux movie characters are actually presenting two sides debate corruption but this is cleverly written into script when performed by kamal these lines become more intense that they actually are involving viewer story rather than its message if only shankar could learn be little more subtle,0.6616666666666667,0.03559523809523809,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.49}"

7.0,A Kamal Haasan hysteria in Shankar's blockbuster magnum opus of human elements,"Indian (1996) : Brief Review -A Kamal Haasan hysteria in Shankar's blockbuster magnum opus of human elements. I have seen this film many times on TV in childhood and enjoyed it every time but i never got that chance of one take viewing with critic/movie buff's mindset. Shankar is maverick director who always tried to bring larger than Life Stories on screen with human connect. His storytelling has always been grander than other directors but what made those films work is that he did not use artificial elements like Hollywood films. His kept his context related to human lives and especially his socialism worked much better. Indian is another powerful human story from him which closes off a smart deal with human sentiments of social sense. A veteran freedom fighter enraged with the rising crime and corruption in the society murders all the wrong doers one by one using an ancient martial arts technique. Like his other films, Shankar uses large eye to execute this saga of hardcore patriotism. You can easily see his humongous vision in high tech action scenes, stupendous sets and even the songs are shot on very big scale. These all things were far ahead for Indian cinema of 90s when South was busy making gangster+negative shade films and Bollywood was busy making romantic and family dramas. So, it works for sure and it worths your time as well. It is dated, not outdated, try to understand the difference. Kamal Haasan in dual role sets a benchmark for other actors that how versatile and compatible one actor can be. Manisha and Urmila are cute and decent whereas Sukanya and Venu sir are convincing enough. Indian is all about Shankar's gigantic vision which provides a wholesome entertainer along with a hard-hitting social message. Like I said it's dated because Shankar has made even better films like Anniyan and Mudhalvan but it is still very much watchable and with 90s mindset it's a freaking amazing experience anyday.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestesst.",kamal haasan hysteria shankars blockbuster magnum opus human elements,indian 1996 brief review kamal haasan hysteria shankars blockbuster magnum opus human elements i have seen this film many times tv childhood enjoyed it every time but i never got that chance one take viewing with critic movie buffs mindset shankar is maverick director who always tried bring larger than life stories screen with human connect his storytelling has always been grander than other directors but what made those films work is that he did not use artificial elements like hollywood films his kept his context related human lives especially his socialism worked much better indian is another powerful human story him which closes off smart deal with human sentiments social sense veteran freedom fighter enraged with rising crime corruption society murders all wrong doers one by one using ancient martial arts technique like his other films shankar uses large eye execute this saga hardcore patriotism you can easily see his humongous vision high tech action scenes stupendous sets even songs are shot very big scale these all things were far ahead indian cinema 90s when south was busy making gangster negative shade films bollywood was busy making romantic family dramas so it works sure it worths your time as well it is dated not outdated try understand difference kamal haasan dual role sets benchmark other actors that how versatile compatible one actor can be manisha urmila are cute decent whereas sukanya venu sir are convincing enough indian is all about shankars gigantic vision which provides wholesome entertainer along with hard hitting social message like i said its dated because shankar has made even better films like anniyan mudhalvan but it is still very much watchable with 90s mindset its freaking amazing experience anyday rating 7 10 by,0.4717496392496393,0.1011038961038961,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"

7.0,Worth watching for Kamal Hassan's Impressive Performance and Special Effects.....,"""Hindustani"" is a Hindi Version of a Tamil Movie and was also an official entry to Oscars in 1996. The story of the movie involves the increasing corruption in government offices and how corruption has engulfed the public and country. For cleaning the corruption, a veteran freedom fighter, who had fought for the country against the British ruler, sharpens his weapons and kills every corrupt official he encounters, including his own son.The story which the film tells is pretty questionable. Is killing every corrupt official a right solution. Despite a very improbable story, the film remains just compulsively watchable and you just feel like clapping when every corrupt official is killed; which explains how important it has been to wipe the roots of corruption. Kamal Hassan in double role is the biggest strength of the film. Especially in the role of an old fighter against corruption, Kamal Hassan excels and you just become compelled to clap for him.The film is pretty overlong though and many scenes and sequences seem to have no connection with the main theme. Only one-third of the film comes to the main theme and is the flawless segment of the film. The film uses superb special effects in the choreography and in the flashbacks showing the historic war against the British Rulers. Urmila Matondkar and Manisha Koirala have very small roles in the film which they have done well and added glamour to the movie. Overall, despite overlong and flawed, the film shall be remembered for a relevant issue the film raises and an excellent performance from Kamal Hassan.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",worth watching kamal hassans impressive performance special effects,hindustani is hindi version tamil movie was also official entry oscars 1996 story movie involves increasing corruption government offices how corruption has engulfed public country cleaning corruption veteran freedom fighter who had fought country against british ruler sharpens his weapons kills every corrupt official he encounters including his own son story which film tells is pretty questionable is killing every corrupt official right solution despite very improbable story film remains just compulsively watchable you just feel like clapping when every corrupt official is killed which explains how important it has been wipe roots corruption kamal hassan double role is biggest strength film especially role old fighter against corruption kamal hassan excels you just become compelled clap him film is pretty overlong though many scenes sequences seem have no connection with main theme only one third film comes main theme is flawless segment film film uses superb special effects choreography flashbacks showing historic war against british rulers urmila matondkar manisha koirala have very small roles film which they have done well added glamour movie overall despite overlong flawed film shall be remembered relevant issue film raises excellent performance kamal hassan rating 3 stars out 4,0.5551972789115646,0.15166666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.28}"

,"Shankar's Churns Another Garbage, This Time It's A Patriotic Vigilant Crock","S. Shankar has a reputation for churning out expensive trash. I couldn't help but crack up when I heard that 'Indian' was India's entry to the Oscars. Not that I hold the Oscars as one of the most esteemed awards but they are classy and the idea that someone would even think of submitting what looks like a B-grade product is beyond laughable. 'Indian' is pretty much just another patriotic vigilant film. Kamal Hassan assumes a dual role. He's stiff as the aged patriot Senapathy who wears the same monotonous facial expression throughout the entire film and as Chandra who hops around like a caricature. Manisha Koirala and Urmila Matondkar do not have much screen time but they shine in their few scenes. Matondkar provides some great comic relief. Sukanya is competent. A.R. Rahman's music is very pleasant to the ears. The lyrics may be weird but they're catchy. Obviously the film hasn't dated well in the technical aspect. The special effects are very poor and the cinematography is flat. Anyway, other than A.R. Rahman's music, 'Indian' doesn't have much to offer. S. Shankar needs to learn that a script comes first where filmmaking is concerned.",shankars churns another garbage this time its patriotic vigilant crock,s shankar has reputation churning out expensive trash i couldnt help but crack up when i heard that indian was indias entry oscars not that i hold oscars as one most esteemed awards but they are classy idea that someone would even think submitting what looks like b grade product is beyond laughable indian is pretty much just another patriotic vigilant film kamal hassan assumes dual role hes stiff as aged patriot senapathy who wears same monotonous facial expression throughout entire film as chandra who hops around like caricature manisha koirala urmila matondkar do not have much screen time but they shine their few scenes matondkar provides some great comic relief sukanya is competent r rahmans music is very pleasant ears lyrics may be weird but theyre catchy obviously film hasnt dated well technical aspect special effects are very poor cinematography is flat anyway other than r rahmans music indian doesnt have much offer s shankar needs learn that script comes first where filmmaking is concerned,0.5204232804232803,0.05097001763668431,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
