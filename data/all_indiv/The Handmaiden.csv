10.0,Masterclass Cinema,"This is hands down the most perfect film I have seen so far this year. I gave a score of 5/5 to movies like The Revenant, Spotlight and The Songs We Sang. But even with these excellent films I can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. With The Handmaiden, it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. Even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors, this is still perfect every way I see it.Auteur Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is a superb exercise in form, structure and tone. With the latter, Park (Oldboy & Joint Security Area) has achieved something extraordinary. If any scene were to linger a few seconds longer or he had decided to focus on a certain issue, the film would have veered off to a different territory. As it is, and with all the major characters' kooky off-kilter portrayals, I can't pinpoint whether I was watching something real or abstract. I was also kept in awe by the intricate and resplendent set- design which suggests something dark and Gothic is working the undercurrents. There are of course some serious girl on girl action but that never encroaches into the spine of the story.Adapting Sarah Waters' Fingersmith, a Victorian tale awash with all manner of Dickensian motifs, Park spins an engrossing tale that ebbs and flows with a Hitchcockian suspense; it withholds as much as it discloses; it is an erotic tale that beats with raw fervour. It is at once a love story but also a menagerie showcasing human beings in their vilest forms. Park's finger hovers over all the buttons, teasing us gleefully but it is with the ultimate restraint that he never descends down to the usual tropes. The story is divided into three chapters; each told from a different character's perspective. The structure is Rashomon-esque but Park puts his own stamp on it. The film may be nearly 2.5 hours but I hardly moved in my seat; my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard. When it ended I couldn't believe 2.5 hours have whizzed by. The plot is pulsating and it never lets up. There is even an octopus in it! This is definitely the most perfect film I have seen this year. You may not agree with me but for me this is cinema of the masterclass level.It's sexy time!",masterclass cinema,this is hands down most perfect film i have seen so far this year i gave score 5 5 movies like revenant spotlight songs we sang but even with these excellent films i can always find spot that doesnt quite sit right with me with handmaiden it is perfect every frame handcrafted perfection even with 4min explicit sex taken away by my countrys dumb censors this is still perfect every way i see it auteur park chan wooks handmaiden is superb exercise form structure tone with latter park oldboy joint security area has achieved something extraordinary if any scene were linger few seconds longer or he had decided focus certain issue film would have veered off different territory as it is with all major characters kooky off kilter portrayals i cant pinpoint whether i was watching something real or abstract i was also kept awe by intricate resplendent set design which suggests something dark gothic is working undercurrents there are course some serious girl girl action but that never encroaches into spine story adapting sarah waters fingersmith victorian tale awash with all manner dickensian motifs park spins engrossing tale that ebbs flows with hitchcockian suspense it withholds as much as it discloses it is erotic tale that beats with raw fervour it is at once love story but also menagerie showcasing human beings their vilest forms parks finger hovers over all buttons teasing us gleefully but it is with ultimate restraint that he never descends down usual tropes story is divided into three chapters each told different characters perspective structure is rashomon esque but park puts his own stamp it film may be nearly 2 5 hours but i hardly moved my seat my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard when it ended i couldnt believe 2 5 hours have whizzed by plot is pulsating it never lets up there is even octopus it this is definitely most perfect film i have seen this year you may not agree with me but me this is cinema masterclass level its sexy time,0.5985529485529485,0.24492665742665737,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,Just amazing,"""The Handmaiden"" is a crazily imaginative and beautiful movie by Chan-wook Park, who is at the top of his game in this story of a pickpocket that tries to steal the fortune of a naive, innocent rich woman that has been secluded in a mansion in the middle of nowhere. Of course, things will start to get complicated soon enough.Chan-wook Park has done a great job in adapting the original novel by Sarah Waters, and mixing it with the history of the Japanese invasion of Korea at the beginning of the twentieth century. The plot is a little bit silly sometimes, but Chan-wook Park makes it all tight and fast-paced, and even the most silly moment becomes a moment of beauty and fun. From the first moment, the viewer will be enthralled by the story of these two women and their relationship, and every plot development will just add fun to the whole.If the plot and the direction weren't amazing enough, the movie is as beautiful as they come. From the darkest moment, the most violent, to the most intimate, beauty transpires in every frame, and every scene comes to life and threatens to pop and break free from the screen. This is helped by the amazing work of all the cast, who does an incredible job in bringing this tale to life (it could be criticized, though, some of the heavily accented Japanese, for characters that are supposed to be able to pass as them).All in all, ""The Handmaiden"" is proof that a movie can have a plot, amazing direction, acting, scenery, craziness and the most beautiful package possible. And even if it is almost two hours and a half long, it feels like a breeze.You will fall in love with this movie. Just plain great.",just amazing,handmaiden is crazily imaginative beautiful movie by chan wook park who is at top his game this story pickpocket that tries steal fortune naive innocent rich woman that has been secluded mansion middle nowhere course things will start get complicated soon enough chan wook park has done great job adapting original novel by sarah waters mixing it with history japanese invasion korea at beginning twentieth century plot is little bit silly sometimes but chan wook park makes it all tight fast paced even most silly moment becomes moment beauty fun first moment viewer will be enthralled by story these two women their relationship every plot development will just add fun whole if plot direction werent amazing enough movie is as beautiful as they come darkest moment most violent most intimate beauty transpires every frame every scene comes life threatens pop break free screen this is helped by amazing work all cast who does incredible job bringing this tale life it could be criticized though some heavily accented japanese characters that are supposed be able pass as them all all handmaiden is proof that movie can have plot amazing direction acting scenery craziness most beautiful package possible even if it is almost two hours half long it feels like breeze you will fall love with this movie just plain great,0.5941220238095238,0.21985367063492067,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,Engaging and attractively packaged and delivered,"I knew nothing about this film coming into it, other that it being very well considered, and that it has some strong sexual content. This is probably the best way to watch it, as I did not know where the plot was going to start or go. Essentially a con man plans to seduce, marry, and abandon a wealthy unmarried woman – taking her from her uncle and then taking her money. To do this he employs the services of a young pickpocket to work as her handmaiden, and help work the plan from the inside, so to speak.What the film does with this basic plot is enjoyable and engaging. The narrative is solid, holds the interest without effort, and is very well paced and structured. I wonder would it work as well if I had known the source material, or had more knowledge of the wider plot. As a con, the plot is solidly enjoyable and avoids the silly flamboyance of some films where such a plot would be allowed to turn into a 'caper'. Within the plot are some surprisingly sexual elements, and these sit across the sweet, the sensual, and the dark. There is also a good amount of humor where it matters – in particular in part 1 of the film, this is used well in relation to the main character.The direction, production values, and general pacing of the film, all work together to give it a beautiful appearance and tone. It is quite sensuous to watch, with such great colors, sets, costumes, and designs. Within this the actors are all strong. Min-hee Kim and Tae- ri Kim in particular are engaging, although the downside of me being into their characters/performances was that it made the heavy nudity in some of their extended scenes feel a bit exploitative in nature. Jung-woo Ha is solid throughout, and Jin-woong Jo is just the right level of monster for the plot to work.A richly enjoyable film, that sits across so many elements and looks so good that it keeps the plot engaging throughout.",engaging attractively packaged delivered,i knew nothing about this film coming into it other that it being very well considered that it has some strong sexual content this is probably best way watch it as i did not know where plot was going start or go essentially con man plans seduce marry abandon wealthy unmarried woman taking her her uncle then taking her money do this he employs services young pickpocket work as her handmaiden help work plan inside so speak what film does with this basic plot is enjoyable engaging narrative is solid holds interest without effort is very well paced structured i wonder would it work as well if i had known source material or had more knowledge wider plot as con plot is solidly enjoyable avoids silly flamboyance some films where such plot would be allowed turn into caper within plot are some surprisingly sexual elements these sit across sweet sensual dark there is also good amount humor where it matters particular part 1 film this is used well relation main character direction production values general pacing film all work together give it beautiful appearance tone it is quite sensuous watch with such great colors sets costumes designs within this actors are all strong min hee kim tae ri kim particular are engaging although downside me being into their characters performances was that it made heavy nudity some their extended scenes feel bit exploitative nature jung woo ha is solid throughout jin woong jo is just right level monster plot work richly enjoyable film that sits across so many elements looks so good that it keeps plot engaging throughout,0.5436011904761905,0.29318452380952387,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.45}"

10.0,Sublime cinema - like Hithcock with the extremity of Oldboy and the sexual candour of Blue is the Warmest Colour.,"I consider Park Chan-Wook to be among the greats of cinema, alongside Scorsese, Tarantino, Fellini, Truffaut, Coppola, Tarkovsky and Nolan. So I had huge expectations going in, and boy, they were met.TheHandmaiden is a masterpiece in pretty much every sense. It is visually exquisite, Costumes, production design, cinematography, music, all combine to create a lush vision of Japan-occupied Korea in the 1930s. Park Chan-Wook is a visually meticulous filmmaker and no film so far of his has showcased his knack for visual storytelling better than the Handmaiden. I went into this film totally blind, which I honestly recommend all people doing, because the plot itself unfolds in such a beautifully engineered fashion.My best description of the film is a Rebecca-like Hitchcockian thriller with the extremity and depravity of films like Oldboy and Battle Royale, and the humanistic sexuality of Blue is the Warmest Colour. All actors are stunning in this film. The two women share an honest, tender romance that is both passionate and moving, with a refreshing candour about the nature of sexuality that is almost never seen in Hollywood productions. The Count is an incredibly charismatic performer who remains appealing despite his many despicable acts.But as always with a Park Chan-Wook film, the real star is the director himself. The way in which this story is crafted is nothing short of engrossing. The outrageous, depraved, sexy, fascinating plot is crafted through multiple perspectives, dashing across back and forth in time, to masterfully reveal key plot points across a never less than spellbinding two hour run time. Some would say the film is slow, but I felt as though the extended running time worked in the film's favour, in order to build character to the extent that the finale for the film feels momentously epic, a real feat considering the movie showcases only four key characters.I was utterly engrossed by this beautifully made film.",sublime cinema like hithcock with extremity oldboy sexual candour blue is warmest colour,i consider park chan wook be among greats cinema alongside scorsese tarantino fellini truffaut coppola tarkovsky nolan so i had huge expectations going boy they were met thehandmaiden is masterpiece pretty much every sense it is visually exquisite costumes production design cinematography music all combine create lush vision japan occupied korea 1930s park chan wook is visually meticulous filmmaker no film so far his has showcased his knack visual storytelling better than handmaiden i went into this film totally blind which i honestly recommend all people doing because plot itself unfolds such beautifully engineered fashion my best description film is rebecca like hitchcockian thriller with extremity depravity films like oldboy battle royale humanistic sexuality blue is warmest colour all actors are stunning this film two women share honest tender romance that is both passionate moving with refreshing candour about nature sexuality that is almost never seen hollywood productions count is incredibly charismatic performer who remains appealing despite his many despicable acts but as always with park chan wook film real star is director himself way which this story is crafted is nothing short engrossing outrageous depraved sexy fascinating plot is crafted through multiple perspectives dashing across back forth time masterfully reveal key plot points across never less than spellbinding two hour run time some would say film is slow but i felt as though extended running time worked films favour order build character extent that finale film feels momentously epic real feat considering movie showcases only four key characters i was utterly engrossed by this beautifully made film,0.6277777777777778,0.26150793650793647,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,will need a 2nd viewing. I mean that as a compliment (mostly),"The Handmaiden is a film that unfolds with a classic film stylist (in particular I felt like Chanwook Park was in a kind of Brian De Palma mode as far as making an erotic dramatic-thriller with a camera that luxuriates in long shots, elaborate camera movements, and cinematic grammar that emphasizes operatic intentions, though it's maybe not the first time he's done this anyway), and is LOADED with story. What appears to be the story of a handmaiden who is put in as part of a long con by a man who wants to steal this wealthy woman's money is actually a story about storytelling, about weaving a pack of lies and an entire personality and, in reality, how that can start to crack apart when it comes to seeing humanity in another person and their vulnerabilities.There's a lot going on in this movie, and there is a lot that is... sordid and over the top in its sexuality. That's intentional, I'm sure, and Park never coddles his audience with what he's showing as far as sexuality; the two main women of the film, the handmaiden and her master/mistress or what have you, end up having an emotional connection and this leads to a sexual one. This has the most graphic lesbian sexuality on screen since Blue is the Warmest Color, but here the rawness is matched by the elegance of Park's direction, and while you get to see much of it, only some of it (but there *is* some) that is gratuitous. Otherwise, this is a story of backstabbing and betrayal, but all of it leading up to being in the larger sense about how people fit in to the circumstances they are in, how they have to not simply play but BECOME the characters they're playing - and how these images flip based on perceptions and how we see the scenes.Here's where I may become less articulate in my criticism: the film is in three parts, and I forgot about there being 'parts' as I was so into the film during its first part. There is a major betrayal, but then the movie goes into a 'Part 2', and it turns into a different story... a VERY different kind of story, and it is one that left me confused at first, left adrift, and only Park's direction kept me afloat. As Part 2 went on I got into the movie more, though you have to be prepared for scenes from part 1 being repeated - and whether this becomes tedious will vary depending on the viewer. Nothing is ever not gorgeous to look at, and Park is inspired by paintings and art in the real world, and it's completely sumptuous (I'd be rooting for this to win all the costume/production design awards come February), but there comes a point where the filmmakers are showing the 'here's what happened this scene' moments a little too much. I won't reveal why this is done except to say that the characters take on other roles we didn't expect, and their decisions and how they hide parts of their personalities makes for fascinating viewing. Some times.And then it gets to part 3, and the movie goes into being sordid melodrama and not much more. By this time, the filmmakers have to wrap the story up, and show what this man who has been trying to machinate everything for his own ends is met with a nasty fate. Overall there's so much about The Handmaiden to admire, from the performances by Min-hee Kim as Lady Hideko (appearing in part 1 as varieties of cold and distant and then close and warm and terrified in the other parts), Tae-ri Kim (Sookie, who has much to learn about the art of performance, I mean her character not the actress, she's great), and Jung-woo Ha as the 'Count' who has to remain in control for the whole runtime, but gives in to his passions too. And yet I also wonder if a first viewing trying to explain everything how I felt doesn't do the film justice: it moves slower and more languidly than other Park films, so it took longer to get in to, and the themes of conning and performance may be done stronger in any given Quentin Tarantino film (though here done with more taste and intense sexuality - i.e. the scene with the thimball on the tooth).Another viewing may give more, or less. I can tell you now it's worth seeing if you love pure CINEMA, the likes of which get made by directors with a passion for the form and expressing stories of early 20th century sexual excess and emotional f***ed-up ness (it is early 20th century Korea with a major Japanese influence - in that way it'd make a solid double feature with Kim Jee-Woon's Age of Shadows). As for whether it's a great film, I'm not so sure.",will need 2nd viewing i mean that as compliment mostly,handmaiden is film that unfolds with classic film stylist particular i felt like chanwook park was kind brian de palma mode as far as making erotic dramatic thriller with camera that luxuriates long shots elaborate camera movements cinematic grammar that emphasizes operatic intentions though its maybe not first time hes done this anyway is loaded with story what appears be story handmaiden who is put as part long con by man who wants steal this wealthy womans money is actually story about storytelling about weaving pack lies entire personality reality how that can start crack apart when it comes seeing humanity another person their vulnerabilities theres lot going this movie there is lot that is sordid over top its sexuality thats intentional im sure park never coddles his audience with what hes showing as far as sexuality two main women film handmaiden her master mistress or what have you end up having emotional connection this leads sexual one this has most graphic lesbian sexuality screen since blue is warmest color but here rawness is matched by elegance parks direction while you get see much it only some it but there is some that is gratuitous otherwise this is story backstabbing betrayal but all it leading up being larger sense about how people fit circumstances they are how they have not simply play but become characters theyre playing how these images flip based perceptions how we see scenes heres where i may become less articulate my criticism film is three parts i forgot about there being parts as i was so into film during its first part there is major betrayal but then movie goes into part 2 it turns into different story very different kind story it is one that left me confused at first left adrift only parks direction kept me afloat as part 2 went i got into movie more though you have be prepared scenes part 1 being repeated whether this becomes tedious will vary depending viewer nothing is ever not gorgeous look at park is inspired by paintings art real world its completely sumptuous id be rooting this win all costume production design awards come february but there comes point where filmmakers are showing heres what happened this scene moments little too much i wont reveal why this is done except say that characters take other roles we didnt expect their decisions how they hide parts their personalities makes fascinating viewing some times then it gets part 3 movie goes into being sordid melodrama not much more by this time filmmakers have wrap story up show what this man who has been trying machinate everything his own ends is met with nasty fate overall theres so much about handmaiden admire performances by min hee kim as lady hideko appearing part 1 as varieties cold distant then close warm terrified other parts tae ri kim sookie who has much learn about art performance i mean her character not actress shes great jung woo ha as count who has remain control whole runtime but gives his passions too yet i also wonder if first viewing trying explain everything how i felt doesnt do film justice it moves slower more languidly than other park films so it took longer get themes conning performance may be done stronger any given quentin tarantino film though here done with more taste intense sexuality i e scene with thimball tooth another viewing may give more or less i can tell you now its worth seeing if you love pure cinema likes which get made by directors with passion form expressing stories early 20th century sexual excess emotional f ed up ness it is early 20th century korea with major japanese influence that way itd make solid double feature with kim jee woons age shadows as whether its great film im not so sure,0.49266578483245144,0.12455687830687832,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8.0,You gotta hand it to Park Chan-wook,"The Handmaiden is a beautifully told story in a beautifully shot film. Some of it's chosen exterior locations are so captivating and mesmerizing, you almost feel you're there, or wish you were. The actresses are beautiful and perform nothing short of excellent, the young girl (The Handmaiden) especially, such a professionally acted job. You'd expect more so sex scenes, that kind of left me a little downtrodden. The major lesbian one, amidst only a couple of others, in this near two and half hour piece, is one of the hottest and most explicit, I've ever seen, this one again, beautifully shot. The story involves a young girl, a new handmaiden, forced to defraud the wife of the husband, only the young girl falls for the wife, where the story kind of manipulates you, as to where the girl's intentions will lead, where revenge is thrown in too, as we go back in time to an earlier period, involving our young girl, and the wife, where we find ourselves returning to some old scenes, but with added stuff- purpose here. This is one you'd have to watch a couple of times to get the complete picture. Didn't understand the change in color of the subtitles, my only qualm. Acting by all is top notch, and our handmaiden is definitely something to ogle at. A handmaiden who's beautifully made. We too have some violence, and some humorous moments. Hopefully this film will command more attention from moviegoers in Adelaide, as here's one faultless cinematic experience, you should experience, and by no accounts, miss, as it will be your loss.

9.0,Park Chan-wook crafts another masterpiece!,"When going into a movie by one of your favorite directors, it is easy to set high expectations. Rarely does the film fully meet those expectations, but when it does it is something special. Such is the case with Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden (Mademoiselle). He has crafted an intricately woven tale of love and betrayal that highlights everything he can do so well from heightened sexual tension to gorgeous imagery. The film, which is an adaptation of the novel The Fingersmith, revolves around a woman who is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress. This is the very basic summary to a film that has a lot of depth underneath the surface and requires the audience's attention throughout the film. And as the plot goes on we discover the newly hired handmaiden may have some ulterior motives along with many of the other characters. Nothing is revealed too quickly and the film is split into a three-part structure that slowly pieces things together through flashbacks. It also uses a storytelling device that is typically owned by Tarantino where the same scene is shown from multiple perspectives and each adds a new layer to the story. All of these devices are used to full effect and create surprising twists on par with Park Chan-wook's Oldboy.What is immediately apparent from the start of the film is how well Park Chan-wook's aesthetic fits into the time period. His eye for gorgeous shots and camera angles makes the house in the film look like a work of art. The grounds around the house are also highlighted so well. Wide shots and lingering camera movements let you appreciate every little detail on screen and marvel at the beauty of it all. The score also fits in perfectly with the time period. It is never bombastic and always subtle, and perfectly captures the mood and feeling of each scene. Whether an intimate moment between the two women or a heated exchange between characters it's hard to realize how great the score is because of how organic it feels. Framing is also a very important addition to the story. Through the use of mirrors and reflections, Park Chan-wook suggests the double-sided nature of the characters. Also, he often obstructs part of the frame with an object and hides characters behind walls or glass to suggest we may not really see everything that is going on before us. This aspect of the film in particular I feel will only get better with subsequent viewing when you can understand all of characters motivations and desires. One thing that Park Chan-wook did so well with Stoker was creating a palpable feeling of sexual tension without using nudity or anything overtly sexual. In this film he succeeds with that throughout the entire film. Every look and every glance the two woman share conveys a longing and desire that permeates the whole film. In this film however, he continues that passion past suggestion into full on sex. There are multiple scenes with extended nudity but they are all filmed so artfully and sympathetically it always feels warranted. The scenes never feel awkward or exploitative and always are tasteful and almost poetic. Somehow despite what I was watching I still found myself admiring the camera-work and beautiful cinematography. One thing that surprised me in the film and I have not seen in Park Chan-wook's other work is the humor. It was never slapstick and usually more circumstantial, but the whole audience laughed out loud on numerous occasions. He showed a surprisingly great understanding of timing and every joke landed. One scene in particular dealt with suicide and could have come across as insensitive or callous. Due to the perfect timing, it was hilarious and even further developed the relationship between the characters. During the last act of the film, it does get unusually violent. There is a torture scene that seems out of place with the rest of the film. Though effective in its own right and thoroughly thrilling, it didn't sit right with me due to how subtle the rest of the film had been. This is a film that really stays with you and will take multiple viewing to really appreciate the complex story. The first film I have seen in a long time where I continued to think about it throughout the day and had multiple conversations about all aspects of the film.

10.0,Blue is the Warmest Color + Oldboy = The Handmaiden,"Not the craziest film content wise, that award goes to The Neon Demon, but definitely the craziest film storytelling wise. Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is almost as good as the film that put him on the map, Oldboy, and brings such ferocity and energy that it will be one of the most unforgettable films of 2016. Think of The Handmaiden as The Duke of Burgundy F'd Up Edition. This film is pretty twisted in the most unexpected ways from the cinematography that is very reminiscent of Possession in that it always keeps moving, eroticism that is reminiscent of Blue is the Warmest Color, performances as spellbinding as Carol, and the insanity of Park Chan- Wook as expected. The cinematography is some of the most entrancing of the year. Shots that look like they came out of The Master. It's shots like these that make me wonder how was this even possible? It looks so damn cool!The performances are perfect in sucking you into this world of erotica, selfishness, and trickery. Both female leads were fantastic. Min-hee Kim and Kim Tae-ri are amazing with sharing their sexual tension with the audience watching. It's films like these that are the most memorable. Making you feel how ther characters are feeling. Jung-woo Ha and Jin- woong Jo were great as these sexually and financially repressed men who do the most screwed up things to feel the pleasure they so desire. Nothing wrong with the cast at all. Of course Park Chank-Wook hits it out of the part with directing. How else would this immaculate vision be done without him niche for detail. He always knows exactly what to do to get an emotion out of his audience and I applaud him for that. The only negative is that during the middle briefly the pacing slows down a lot and it became really unbearable because I wanted to know exactly what was going to happen next. Thankfully it doesn't last that long and it's really minor that probably won't affect others viewings. If you have any interest in The Handmaiden or you've just heard about it for the first time I strongly suggest checking this out as soon as it comes out. I'll definitely re watch it when it releases in theaters. Easily one of the best films of the year and one I hope to re watch soon.",blue is warmest color oldboy handmaiden,not craziest film content wise that award goes neon demon but definitely craziest film storytelling wise park chan wooks handmaiden is almost as good as film that put him map oldboy brings such ferocity energy that it will be one most unforgettable films 2016 think handmaiden as duke burgundy fd up edition this film is pretty twisted most unexpected ways cinematography that is very reminiscent possession that it always keeps moving eroticism that is reminiscent blue is warmest color performances as spellbinding as carol insanity park chan wook as expected cinematography is some most entrancing year shots that look like they came out master its shots like these that make me wonder how was this even possible it looks so damn cool performances are perfect sucking you into this world erotica selfishness trickery both female leads were fantastic min hee kim kim tae ri are amazing with sharing their sexual tension with audience watching its films like these that are most memorable making you feel how ther characters are feeling jung woo ha jin woong jo were great as these sexually financially repressed men who do most screwed up things feel pleasure they so desire nothing wrong with cast at all course park chank wook hits it out part with directing how else would this immaculate vision be done without him niche detail he always knows exactly what do get emotion out his audience i applaud him that only negative is that during middle briefly pacing slows down lot it became really unbearable because i wanted know exactly what was going happen next thankfully it doesnt last that long its really minor that probably wont affect others viewings if you have any interest handmaiden or youve just heard about it first time i strongly suggest checking this out as soon as it comes out ill definitely re watch it when it releases theaters easily one best films year one i hope re watch soon,0.5591435185185184,0.22002314814814813,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6.0,"Well-made, but I wanted something grittier","I admit to being a little disappointed when I found out that master film-maker Park Chan-wook's latest film would be THE HANDMAIDEN, a remake of a lesbian romantic drama filmed by the BBC as FINGERSMITH. This one relocates a tale of Victorian London to South Korea, where a murky plot involves mucho double-crossing as a con man decides to employ a maid to help him seduce a Japanese heiress due to inherit a fortune.Like the rest of Park Chan-wook's output, this is an expertly-made piece of drama, with sumptuous costumes and filmography, and fine performances from the cast. A pity, then, that it turns out to be merely a romantic drama with a few dark twists. The emphasis is on explicit sex throughout. Imagine if the director had instead put his talents to making another film like OLDBOY - now that would have been something special. This lengthy, languidly-paced film has some good storytelling methods and nice twists throughout, but otherwise it feels disappointingly shallow.",well made but i wanted something grittier,i admit being little disappointed when i found out that master film maker park chan wooks latest film would be handmaiden remake lesbian romantic drama filmed by bbc as fingersmith this one relocates tale victorian london south korea where murky plot involves mucho double crossing as con man decides employ maid help him seduce japanese heiress due inherit fortune like rest park chan wooks output this is expertly made piece drama with sumptuous costumes filmography fine performances cast pity then that it turns out be merely romantic drama with few dark twists emphasis is explicit sex throughout imagine if director had instead put his talents making another film like oldboy now that would have been something special this lengthy languidly paced film has some good storytelling methods nice twists throughout but otherwise it feels disappointingly shallow,0.46227678571428565,0.04549851190476191,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,Tour De Force!,"The controversial film from Korean master Chan-wook Park evokes the sexiness of Abdellatif Kechiche's ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" and Park's own signature violence and thrills. Set in the 1930s Japanese occupied Korea, it's a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Min-hee Kim). However, she must manage to convince the heiress to marry a conman (Jung-woo Ha) who poses as a count, for which she will get a chance for a better life. She gets into a moral dilemma when she starts developing feelings for the heiress.The Handmaiden is a triumph on every level. The film is divided into three chapters, all giving different perspective. This way, the story is perfectly structured to give more and more insight as the film progresses, but at the same time, keep the viewers guessing. It offers a few surprises along the way as well. Visually, it's a feast for the eyes. The term ""every frame a painting"" gets overused, but it really fits here. I'm not only talking about cinematography, which offered plenty of memorable shots and beautiful scenery, but the costume and set design. The three leads all gave terrific performances. Musical score by Yeong-wook evokes, or better said, amplifies the emotions and the suspenseful tone. Despite the run time of 2 hours and 24 minutes, it never gets dull, it's very evenly paced throughout. I couldn't look away for a second.One thing needs to be addressed, the film is quite explicit. That being said, it never gets vulgar, the sex scenes are done in perfect taste, they never feel out of place and they're not there just for the sake of it. The relationship between the characters and the physical presentation of it are integral to the film. It's a film about passion, abuse, jealousy, betrayal and deception, but most of all, it's an atypical love story, which will make one love and hate the protagonists at the same time. It's original and daring work of art that will stick with viewers long after it's finished.Whenever Chan-wook Park makes a film, it must undoubtedly be compared to his masterpiece, ""Oldboy"". I don't think that ""The Handmaiden"" surpasses it, but it comes very close. With this film, he proved himself to be one of the greatest working directors today. It's the best film I've seen this year, one that I can't wait to revisit. It's not to be missed.",tour de force,controversial film korean master chan wook park evokes sexiness abdellatif kechiches blue is warmest colour parks own signature violence thrills set 1930s japanese occupied korea its story young female pickpocket kim tae ri who becomes handmaiden beautiful japanese heiress min hee kim however she must manage convince heiress marry conman jung woo ha who poses as count which she will get chance better life she gets into moral dilemma when she starts developing feelings heiress handmaiden is triumph every level film is divided into three chapters all giving different perspective this way story is perfectly structured give more more insight as film progresses but at same time keep viewers guessing it offers few surprises along way as well visually its feast eyes term every frame painting gets overused but it really fits here im not only talking about cinematography which offered plenty memorable shots beautiful scenery but costume set design three leads all gave terrific performances musical score by yeong wook evokes or better said amplifies emotions suspenseful tone despite run time 2 hours 24 minutes it never gets dull its very evenly paced throughout i couldnt look away second one thing needs be addressed film is quite explicit that being said it never gets vulgar sex scenes are done perfect taste they never feel out place theyre not there just sake it relationship between characters physical presentation it are integral film its film about passion abuse jealousy betrayal deception but most all its atypical love story which will make one love hate protagonists at same time its original daring work art that will stick with viewers long after its finished whenever chan wook park makes film it must undoubtedly be compared his masterpiece oldboy i dont think that handmaiden surpasses it but it comes very close with this film he proved himself be one greatest working directors today its best film ive seen this year one that i cant wait revisit its not be missed,0.4955703211517165,0.23217054263565895,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.4}"
6.0,"Tedious, long winded, beautifully shot","""The Handmaiden"" is a fairly tedious, hard-to-follow art movie.It looks great, like a photography book come to life... sort of. But just because it's nice to look at, doesn't mean it's fun to watch.The story is told in three parts, each introduced by an on-screen title. The movie goes back and forth on the timeline a bit.It's so long-winded in parts that I stopped caring who everyone was and what they were doing. This is anathema in any movie, but more so for one that fills you in after the fact. I am generally loath to assume that the only reason someone says they like an adults only movie is because of the sex. Here, I have to make an exception. Yes, it does have some fairly graphic lesbian scenes - though not much compared to ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"". And yes, this lesbianism is between two pretty, young Korean actresses.Supposedly, at least most guys love to see women make out, and most of them also have a preference for Asian women. I realise I am an anomaly in not being that excited by either. And take the sex out of the movie, and what do you have?A photography book you'd enjoy flipping through, but not enough of a story to make you want to take it home.",tedious long winded beautifully shot,handmaiden is fairly tedious hard follow art movie it looks great like photography book come life sort but just because its nice look at doesnt mean its fun watch story is told three parts each introduced by screen title movie goes back forth timeline bit its so long winded parts that i stopped caring who everyone was what they were doing this is anathema any movie but more so one that fills you after fact i am generally loath assume that only reason someone says they like adults only movie is because sex here i have make exception yes it does have some fairly graphic lesbian scenes though not much compared blue is warmest colour yes this lesbianism is between two pretty young korean actresses supposedly at least most guys love see women make out most them also have preference asian women i realise i am anomaly not being that excited by either take sex out movie what do you have photography book youd enjoy flipping through but not enough story make you want take it home,0.565327380952381,0.12931547619047618,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.2}"

The manipulation of colour is done masterfully as well.But other than that I had trouble finding any substance to the film. I enjoyed some scenes, the interaction between actors, but most of them did not feel real so I didn't really take anything from it.There are several slow parts where scenes are replayed from a different perspective and it's mostly interesting for the sexual discovery the characters partake.

4.0,Huge fan of Chan-wook Park but this is just tripe,"So many previously good films, mostly revenge based. I even love the Drummer Girl series so after reading some great reviews I watched it with subtitles.After a slow start I was still hooked and kept slogging my way through this and when I finally finished I was left wondering what all the fuss was about. I can't recommend this to anyone. The extended graphic sex scenes don't serve the story at all and are just for ratings. How can anyone not see this is beyond me. The story is barely there and predictable after 30 minutes.I think that because there are Korean and Japanese languages spoken, rather well I'm told, that this movie gets a boost. Another boost for nudity and a bit of revenge. It's a 5 at best if you ignore these bonuses. I rate it a 4 because I'm expecting a good quality film from a respected director, who doesn't need to make soft core porn to increase his audience. It's a major let down and prevents his other films from being noticed.",huge fan chan wook park but this is just tripe,so many previously good films mostly revenge based i even love drummer girl series so after reading some great reviews i watched it with subtitles after slow start i was still hooked kept slogging my way through this when i finally finished i was left wondering what all fuss was about i cant recommend this anyone extended graphic sex scenes dont serve story at all are just ratings how can anyone not see this is beyond me story is barely there predictable after 30 minutes i think that because there are korean japanese languages spoken rather well im told that this movie gets boost another boost nudity bit revenge its 5 at best if you ignore these bonuses i rate it 4 because im expecting good quality film respected director who doesnt need make soft core porn increase his audience its major let down prevents his other films being noticed,0.4559941520467837,0.23852339181286547,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,there are places that you can't truly understand,"You may have heard Park Chan-wook's ""Ah-gah-si"" (""The Handmaiden"" in English) called an erotic psychological thriller. That's true, but the movie is more. It addresses relationships and abuse. Very well, I might add. I'm not sure how much of it I can describe without giving a lot away. I can just say that you have probably never seen anything like this. There's plenty of sex, but none of it gratuitous.The only other Park movie that I've seen is the bland ""Stoker"", so I'm impressed. I would definitely like to see the rest of his movies. Moreover, I would like to see more movies set in Korea under Japanese colonial rule (a part of history too often overlooked). Not a masterpiece, but one that I recommend.",there are places that you cant truly understand,you may have heard park chan wooks ah gah si handmaiden english called erotic psychological thriller thats true but movie is more it addresses relationships abuse very well i might add im not sure how much it i can describe without giving lot away i can just say that you have probably never seen anything like this theres plenty sex but none it gratuitous only other park movie that ive seen is bland stoker so im impressed i would definitely like see rest his movies moreover i would like see more movies set korea under japanese colonial rule part history too often overlooked not masterpiece but one that i recommend,0.5362847222222222,0.15052083333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.62}"
9.0,"Not Old Boy, but that's OK","Sex. One of the most overused element in cinema and often mis-used and unnecessary. I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used sex scene could make the movie feels cheap. This movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all other elements that were done well in the movie.Thematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple elegant design.The story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.The music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable. The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add everything together.It isn't a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved here and there.

6.0,Lavish but strangely juvenile,"Sarah Walters's novel 'Fingersmith', a tale of power, perversion, pornography and passion in Victorian England, gets a lavish Korean makeover in Park Choon-Wok's movie 'The Handmaiden'. It's certainly visually and thematically rich and provocative as it slides between frequently explicit romance, comedy and horror: if in part it aims to shock, it certainly does so in style. However, I struggled to like any of the characters, all of whom seem as selfish and ruthless as each other, and felt no especial sympathy for the female leads simply because they happen to fall in love/list for each other.

People kept talking about the twist at the end and I can assure you there's no twist whatsoever. Both women tricked each other with the man at first and when his lady wanted to hang herself in the cherry tree, the two united against the man.

If you remove the unquestionably excessive scenes, it becomes a thrilling tale of deception and cunning, with dialogue and acting that deeply convinced me the actor's truly felt their characters' emotions. But the continuous bombardment of pornography makes it very clear that director Park had no intentions of making a respectable film. Perhaps his intention was to see if he could persuade critics that an overtly explicit work could somehow be considered art rather than pornography?

There is nudity and adult situations (not sure if they are cut in the theatrical release), but that is not something that should be disturbing the viewer at all. If it does, maybe the movie is not something you should watch (or read up on if there is less nudity in the other cut).Having concenterated way too much on that aspect (it is what it is as someone recently said in a way worse context), the movie is well told and may reprise certain moments to give the viewer a fuller picture of what he experienced - which overall is a nice thing, but some may find redundant. Park Chan Wook is more than Old Boy, if you are still stuck on that (great movie no doubt), and he more than proves it here",handmaids tale,i watched longer directors cut movie it is something behold very interesting story that might have intrigued someone like m night shyamalan too i always have think if i wrote that correctly would be nice if imdb had feature where it recognized names helped one out story its pace are fairly easy slow follow there is nudity adult situations not sure if they are cut theatrical release but that is not something that should be disturbing viewer at all if it does maybe movie is not something you should watch or read up if there is less nudity other cut having concenterated way too much that aspect it is what it is as someone recently said way worse context movie is well told may reprise certain moments give viewer fuller picture what he experienced which overall is nice thing but some may find redundant park chan wook is more than old boy if you are still stuck that great movie no doubt he more than proves it here,0.47762249827467207,0.16765010351966875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.47}"
