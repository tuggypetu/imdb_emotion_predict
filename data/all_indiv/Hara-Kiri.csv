10.0,Samurai Genre is Used to Exposively Indict Japanese Politics and Culture,"I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.",samurai genre is used exposively indict japanese politics culture,i saw harakiri seppuku new 35 mm print at nycs film forum this is brilliant use narrow period genre explosively indict politics culture writers shinobu hashimoto yasuhiko takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by count monte cristo ambrose bierce howard hawks westerns as much as by samurai literature movies film begins deceptively as story within story seemingly providing traditional example upholding samurai honor such as conventional oft retold tale 47 ronin context is set at time when central government shogunate is supplanting local clans arbitrarily unemploying thousands people notably their samurai forcing them into mercenary mode ronin at best begging food at worse but parallels 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as samurai who comes this clan seeking help is hiroshima very gradually we get further insight tale within tale as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations we get uneasy inklings that moral story may not be what it appears at first stakes get higher higher with almost unbearable tension it is almost halfway through film until we see female we suddenly see alternative model masculinity where priority is put family support education creative productivity comparison macho opening relationships with their emphasis formal militaristic loyalty hierarchy loving husband father is practically metrosexual seeing same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds his grandbaby puts earlier ritualized scenes sharp relief particularly recurring image clans armor which seems less less imposing is finally destroyed as empty symbol psychological tension confrontations last third film is more excruciating than actual violence even when we thought we already knew outcome flashbacks layers perception relationships personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust sword reveal depths horrifying hypocrisy political social structure those are just overwhelming cultural resonances that 21st century american can glean like downfall der untergang it reveals inhumane mentality that led world war ii repeating motif long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps characters revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional japanese art including drops blood like first snow flakes then waterfall over all effect this masterpiece is emotionally draining,0.42744677349940496,0.07332662464241413,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,Disharmony of Sword and Pen,"I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business."" At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.",disharmony sword pen,ive said it once about another movie incidentally by other great japanese director as well i want repeat my words regard harakiri there are good very good even great movies but among them there are just few that go beyond great they belong league their own masaki kobayashis harakiri aka seppuku is one them film rare power humanism highest artistic achievements profoundly moving tragic like best shakespeares plays universal timeless even if it takes place faraway country 1630 by words one reviewers harakiri is cinema as sistine chapel is painting unsurpassable film grabbed me very first shot its opening credits with their perfect harmony kanji i believe it is correct word describe writings characters with unusual disturbing score with dark beauty images then story begins that centers hanshiro tsugumo tatsuya nakadai one hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais ronin that blessed times peace had not many choices adjust new life often preferred commit ritual suicide hara kiri or seppuku property wealthy estate owners according bushido way samurai one who is samurai must before all things keep constantly mind by day by night fact that he has die that is his chief business at same time samurai anti samurai film harakiri offers masterfully screened scenes sword fights not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed perfectly paced unbearably intense but film is much more than that it is also gripping court drama where truth is unfolded flashbacks viewers are allowed look closer at noble samurai code behavior reflect how its abuse impacts fate individual society general compelling poetic tragic movie has one most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how history is made how historical events are interpreted who decides what would be written chronicles important documents what would be left out masterpiece one best movies ever made harakiri deserves all its praise it is not my nature force my opinion anyone but if you call yourself movie buff or movie lover you must see this film,0.5992699724517907,0.2982128099173554,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Rituals and appearances aren't just about the Japanese,"""Harakiri"" (""Seppuku"") (Japanese, 1962): It is the 17th century. A young Samurai warrior arrives at a mansion, asking to perform his ritual death there. In a series of flashbacks, we learn who he is, why he came, and what has occurred since. Although quietly told by another ex-warrior (about whom we also learn more), this is an interesting story that builds in complexity and tension. Debates about rituals and appearances may at first seem to hold more significance in old Japan than in the contemporary United States, but it is not difficult to translate and implement such thoughts. Love, honor, duty, family, children, saving ""face"", determination, desperationthey all exist in OUR everyday lives. Dramatically photographed in beautiful black & white, given a strong Japanese score, and paced so that even the mildly patient will be glad they saw it, ""Harakiri"" is epically huge, and a must-see for story & film lovers.",rituals appearances arent just about japanese,harakiri seppuku japanese 1962 it is 17th century young samurai warrior arrives at mansion asking perform his ritual death there series flashbacks we learn who he is why he came what has occurred since although quietly told by another ex warrior about whom we also learn more this is interesting story that builds complexity tension debates about rituals appearances may at first seem hold more significance old japan than contemporary united states but it is not difficult translate implement such thoughts love honor duty family children saving face determination desperation they all exist our everyday lives dramatically photographed beautiful black white given strong japanese score paced so that even mildly patient will be glad they saw it harakiri is epically huge must see story film lovers,0.4636363636363637,0.22803030303030303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Does to the Samurai genre what Wild Bunch did to the Western!,"Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.The plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of ""Ran"", ""Kagemusha"" and ""Sword of Doom"") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think ""Wild Bunch with katanas"", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).Kobayashi's direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai's performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.If you're open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you've ever seen.",does samurai genre what wild bunch did western,having seen this film mind becomes clouded with innumerable things say about it only praise comes mind kobayashi has crafted great samurai film rebel generation he mixes deftly handled criticism authoritarian hypocrisy with very touching piece human drama plot is deceptively simple old samurai touchingly portrayed by tatsuya nakadai ran kagemusha sword doom arrives at clan castle commit seppuku their yard then tells his tale seemingly trying gain time at first what seems be rambling old man soon turns out be grieving account how this man more significantly his loved ones was wronged by clan then comes violent revenge this is where you think wild bunch with katanas though they do up ante toward end with guns kobayashis direction is masterful keeping unbearable suspense during mostly talky film handling touching scenes with care maturity giving us sweeping fight top all that 133 minutes running time never feels half that long at heart it all though is nakadai who despite excellent cv delivers his greatest performance ever his tsugumo evokes wounded panther grieving grieving until it gives fury nakadais performance alone marks film as essential viewing if youre open samurai flicks this will rank among finest films youve ever seen,0.5641534391534392,0.25771604938271603,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,200 Proof,"This film is the purest distillation of the spirit of Greek tragedy ever put on celluloid. Yes, this is a review of Seppuku, a Japanese film released in 1962. Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century. That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving. The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history. It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death. This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face. There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them.

10.0,A Gem of Japanese Cinema,"Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.Every frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film's technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa's work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being ""a facade"" to directly quote the film.I say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.",gem japanese cinema,harakiri is excellent human drama set feudal japan that involves ronin presenting himself powerful clan asking commit harikiri however through series flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than idea dying honorably events that follow are critique feudal system celebration dying ones beliefs every frame harikiri is wonderfully composed treat view cinematography is crisp sets wonderful actors are spectacular much can be said about this films technical merits as well as its social implications i found out about this film through my love akira kurosawas samurai dramas who else i must say that it is very different kurosawa sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons due its themes harikiri is more anti samurai film generally kurosawas work seems glorify honor samurai celebrate them as japanese heroes by showing them gloriously battle kurosawa is japanese john ford taking icon his culture celebrating it harikiri exposes virtues that kurosawa portrays as being facade directly quote film i say this so as not mislead any potential viewers i do not know enough about japanese history judge what samurai really stood really i am not concerned with idea this is only kobyashi film i have seen it has been brought my attention that many his films deal with similar themes all all i think that harikiri is wonderful film that offers new take feudal japan,0.49040246212121213,0.2420217803030303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,So Close To Perfection,"Seven Samurai is pretty great, but I think Harakiri is even better. This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it's never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.My only complaints are with some of the pacing and fight choreography. There's a standoff scene in the middle that could have been cut (since it felt like a cheap way to build tension and it wouldn't make sense for them to continue waiting afterward) and the long flashback could have also been trimmed. The film is 2 hours 13 minutes but I think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect. From a fight choreography standpoint the one-on-one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky. There were many interesting ideas and moments in there, but also several points where I was like ""okay, how did they not strike him there?""Harakiri is an outstanding film that deserves more attention. If you haven't seen this film check it out. The Criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful. I intentionally kept this review vague since it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. With a few thousand more ratings, this film would be pretty high up on the IMDb Top 250, and I'd be delighted to see it there.",so close perfection,seven samurai is pretty great but i think harakiri is even better this tale ronin seeking revenge exposing flawed samurai code is so close perfection story is engrossing despite slow pacing its never boring what production lacks scale it makes up with emotional intensity sparse ominous score is perfect this film direction cinematography are masterful cameras slow pans zooms really butter my croissant editing is great purposeful too theres not single weak performance but tatsuya nakadai leading role steals show my only complaints are with some pacing fight choreography theres standoff scene middle that could have been cut since it felt like cheap way build tension it wouldnt make sense them continue waiting afterward long flashback could have also been trimmed film is 2 hours 13 minutes but i think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect fight choreography standpoint one one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky there were many interesting ideas moments there but also several points where i was like okay how did they not strike him there harakiri is outstanding film that deserves more attention if you havent seen this film check it out criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful i intentionally kept this review vague since its best go into it knowing as little as possible with few thousand more ratings this film would be pretty high up imdb top 250 id be delighted see it there,0.5911355311355311,0.28333028083028083,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,Humanism against the Samurai code of honor,"The generation that came after the renown Japanese directors Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented. The main representatives of this generation are Kaneto Shindo, Kon Ichikawa en Masaki Kobayshi. Personally I would like to make an exception for Masaki Kobayashi, who is in my opinion the equal of Kurosawa, Ozu and Muzoguchi.Kobayashi is best known in the West for his ghost stories ""Kwaidan"" (1964). The rest of his repertoire, among which the samurai movie ""Harakiri"" (1962), is not to be sneezed at either.A samurai movie is usually seen as a sort of Western of the East. Main ingredients of the Western genre are action and the battle beween the law (good) and the villains (bad).In ""Harakiri"" (which literal translation is: hara = belly , kiri = cutting) in stead of the law there is the samurai code of honor (Bushido in Japanese). But this code of honor is not the good element of the film. Rather it is revealed as a force of ruthlessness and hypocrisy. In the film the Bushido is represented by the Li clan.In ""Harakiri"" there is also little action. Only towards the end there is something that can be seen as a ""shoot out"". But in this shoot out the evil is not overcome, but only revealed as shallow (the idol of the Li clan is shown to be an empty armor).Translated in Western movie genres ""Harakiri"" is therefore no Western. Maybe it can be categorised as a Court room drama. The heart of the film consists of main character Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) telling his sad story. This story is in essence a requisitor against the Bushido. The performance of Nakadai as a broken Tsugumo is brilliant. His requisitor is not only aimed at the Li clan, but also against his own past. Once Tsugumo also was a samurai.Kobayashi was a convinced humanist all his life. Apart from ""Harakiri"" he also made the 9,5 hours epos ""The human condition"" (1959-1961). This epos is situated in World War II. For Kobayashi kamikaze was just another form of Harakiri and thus just another utterance of the old Bushido.",humanism against samurai code honor,generation that came after renown japanese directors kurosawa ozu mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented main representatives this generation are kaneto shindo kon ichikawa en masaki kobayshi personally i would like make exception masaki kobayashi who is my opinion equal kurosawa ozu muzoguchi kobayashi is best known west his ghost stories kwaidan 1964 rest his repertoire among which samurai movie harakiri 1962 is not be sneezed at either samurai movie is usually seen as sort western east main ingredients western genre are action battle beween law good villains bad harakiri which literal translation is hara belly kiri cutting stead law there is samurai code honor bushido japanese but this code honor is not good element film rather it is revealed as force ruthlessness hypocrisy film bushido is represented by li clan harakiri there is also little action only towards end there is something that can be seen as shoot out but this shoot out evil is not overcome but only revealed as shallow idol li clan is shown be empty armor translated western movie genres harakiri is therefore no western maybe it can be categorised as court room drama heart film consists main character hanshiro tsugumo tatsuya nakadai telling his sad story this story is essence requisitor against bushido performance nakadai as broken tsugumo is brilliant his requisitor is not only aimed at li clan but also against his own past once tsugumo also was samurai kobayashi was convinced humanist all his life apart harakiri he also made 9 5 hours epos human condition 1959 1961 this epos is situated world war ii kobayashi kamikaze was just another form harakiri thus just another utterance old bushido,0.44398148148148153,-0.002430555555555543,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.38}"

The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsurô Tanba) convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master.Tsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son.

,Layered Stories in Conflict,"This has to be the best movie I have seen in a while. Good luck to me that I would like to pass on to you.We have two warring narrators. The first begins the film as an entry in his journal as local governor of a wealthy country estate. The film is closed with him finishing his entry, some days later. This official narrative deviates from what we see at the end.His story: one, then a second unattached ronin appeal to commit suicide in their courtyard. The first of these it is plain is just looking to be paid to leave, but our narrator is very strict about cleaving to that ronin's story. If he says he wants to kill himself, well then he must. This poor man had sold his sword and was now carrying bamboo, and it is this that he was forced to use. The resulting death is disturbing.So midway in the film, we have a samurai who has suffered because he was forced to live his story, forced by the narrator-governor who we later watch not live the story he has created and instead change it to suit.Now along comes an older samurai with the same request. He is dealt with in the same manner, but insists on telling a story to the assembled household before killing himself. He tells an amazing story: a fall from grace of his master, the dissolution of the household, poverty. His frail daughter and her son lay dying without a few coins for a doctor. The man's son is his daughter's husband, and it is he that came and was forced to die. The wife and son do as well, shortly after. Details of that death were told by the governor to the elder samurai earlier, though known because of the mocking way the body was returned.Until now, we have a classic case of warring narrative. We have the captive audience assembled. One storyteller is an official, so much so that he controls the official version of the film's story. The other has power in his gritty, true story. That story, incidentally is very close to what I consider noir: a random innocent fellow is cast in circumstances that seem full of circumstance and accident. The events of his life are played out not as they would in real life but as they would in a fictional life in a story told by others.Truth versus power in a struggle for the story of the film, essentially a struggle for the allegiance of the outer audience: us.The two beings as they face off are perfect in small mannerisms belying tension.Then slowly, the governor's world explodes as we learn new bits of the elder ronin's story of recent events.

7.0,Hanshiro is introduced as a Ronin asking the Iyi Clan masters if they would accept his desire to perform harakiri in their courtyard as a dignified samurai.,"This film is narrated by more than on e person. However the main character, Hanshiro, gets to tell his full story of how and why he got there to the Iyi Clan. There is suspicion from the beginning when he is asked if he really ants to perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or a job. The counselor asks him this and Hanshiro replies the same answer that his son in law, Motome, did when he came in search for an open hand. Through Hanshiro's story telling, we are able to see the true meaning for why he is there; revenge for his lost family. Althpugh his intention is not on killing them, he simply wants them to acknowledge the unethical way they went about with Motome. In the beginning of them movie, the Iyi Clan armor is depicted as honorable, brave and even a little frightening however after the plot uncovers how the samurai retainers acted, the armor becomes an insignificant and worthless statue.",hanshiro is introduced as ronin asking iyi clan masters if they would accept his desire perform harakiri their courtyard as dignified samurai,this film is narrated by more than e person however main character hanshiro gets tell his full story how why he got there iyi clan there is suspicion beginning when he is asked if he really ants perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or job counselor asks him this hanshiro replies same answer that his son law motome did when he came search open hand through hanshiros story telling we are able see true meaning why he is there revenge his lost family althpugh his intention is not killing them he simply wants them acknowledge unethical way they went about with motome beginning them movie iyi clan armor is depicted as honorable brave even little frightening however after plot uncovers how samurai retainers acted armor becomes insignificant worthless statue,0.505952380952381,0.12708333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.54}"
,Great movie,"When I first saw this movie, I did not know much about it. I saw it for a class so I was given a little background of the time period. In fact I was pretty much just told this: This movie takes place during the time where many Samurai were left ronins, or masterless. These samurai were unable to find work and thereby were left in poverty. Eventually many would go up to clans and ask to commit seppuku.It was dishonorable to refuse such a ""noble"" request, but most clans did not want samurai to kill themselves on their property so they would just pay the samurai to go elsewhere.So I watched the movie and well... I loved it. During the class discussion the next day I found most people hated the movie. Not because it was a bad movie, but because of how it made people feel about themselves. And that's exactly why this movie is genius. If you're interested in watching this movie, do not read the summary in detail - reading the summary in detail will deprive you of what one of the key things that made the movie great IMO.",great movie,when i first saw this movie i did not know much about it i saw it class so i was given little background time period fact i was pretty much just told this this movie takes place during time where many samurai were left ronins or masterless these samurai were unable find work thereby were left poverty eventually many would go up clans ask commit seppuku it was dishonorable refuse such noble request but most clans did not want samurai kill themselves their property so they would just pay samurai go elsewhere so i watched movie well i loved it during class discussion next day i found most people hated movie not because it was bad movie but because how it made people feel about themselves thats exactly why this movie is genius if youre interested watching this movie do not read summary detail reading summary detail will deprive you what one key things that made movie great imo,0.5021739130434782,0.17445652173913045,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,This is the best character study & Samurai movie ever made.,"I have seen this movie numerous times (at least 10, probably many more), and enjoy it each time. The first couple of times I saw it was right after it came out. It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made. That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.The movie is not limited to feudal Japan, for it transcends this era. It has lessons, for those who look for this in art. For instance, just one example occurs to me now: It underscores the need for a person to stand on principle, and to maintain their honor, ethics, and dignity, even when those who are the political leaders have long since lost theirs. However for purely entertainment value, the realism, suspense, art, and action could not be better. Words fail to express how this film captivates and entertains. Few films can equal this one. It is a ""must see.""",this is best character study samurai movie ever made,i have seen this movie numerous times at least 10 probably many more enjoy it each time first couple times i saw it was right after it came out it did not have sub titles as my japanese is not very good i made some assumptions about characters relationships plot etc when i saw it with sub titles i was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions i had made that i made so few errors is no credit me but rather how well plot character development character relationships overall movie were done movie is not limited feudal japan it transcends this era it has lessons those who look this art instance just one example occurs me now it underscores need person stand principle maintain their honor ethics dignity even when those who are political leaders have long since lost theirs however purely entertainment value realism suspense art action could not be better words fail express how this film captivates entertains few films can equal this one it is must see,0.32710622710622705,0.09419493549928332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,Honor and Hypocrisy,"It would seem impossible that any ""samurai"" movie could surpass Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or even ""Rashomon"" in visual impact, masterful storytelling, and moral imperative. However, there is such a film, and it is ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri""), produced in 1962, arguably the best samurai movie ever made.""Harakiri"" (1962), as it is known in the West, was directed by one of the post-WWII great filmmakers of Japan, Masaki Kobayashi. This film, considered by many as his masterpiece, won him the International Jury Prize at Cannes in 1965. Unfortunately, Kabayashi is not as well known outside Japan as some other giants of the Japanese cinema. He was very much affected by the war, and his films, contrary to most Japanese filmmakers of the post-war eras, are very political in nature. Kobayashi's films explore the dark side of the Japanese culture, with its wars, corruption, and hypocrisy, and their consequences. His film, ""The Thick-Walled Room"" (1953), won him the 1956 Peace Culture Prize. His nine-hour trilogy, ""The Human Condition"" (1959/61), won the International Jury Prize at Cannes 1963, which actually launched his public recognition, presents a scathing critique of the horrors of WWII, experienced first-hand while on the Manchurian front, and later on the Ryukyu Islands. While serving, as a statement of dissent against war, he refused any promotion and remained a private until he was taken prisoner by the U.S. He spent one year in a prison camp before returning to the business of film making, in 1946, until 1952 as an assistant director under Keisuke Kinishita.In Japan, Seppuku is the formal term for ritual suicide by disembowelment. Harakiri, as it is known in the West, is the common term, which literally means ""stomach cutting."" It was an integral part of bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai warrior class. Seppuku was ordered by a superior as punishment to redeem some offence, or chosen over a dishonorable death at the hands of an enemy. In both cases, it demonstrated the honor, courage, loyalty, and high moral character of the individual. Except when performed on a battlefield, it was a very formal ceremony, requiring certain etiquette, witnesses and considerable preparation.Harakiri is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending one's days. In this ritual, the ""performer"" opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is so need to be left for hours contemplating one's entrails. Another swordsman acting as a ""second,"" called kaishakunin, is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great shogunate dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the ""performer"" was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan.Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the castle of the Iyi Clan to seek revenge for the humiliation and cruel death of his son-in-law, Anjiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama). Kobayashi is a superb storyteller, and in a slow and deliberate rhythm, he develops his story, which could have been taken from the pages of the Iliad or of the Mahabharata. The tension grows, as the Clan members slowly realize that they are in turn being humiliated by this stranger who truly believe in the samurai code of honor: he must be terminated to prevent him to broadcast his truth.The final duel with the master swordsmen of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death. The film ends in a spectacular combat, and the coup de grace to Hanshiro Tsugomo's seppuku is fittingly not applied by a gallant swordsman, but a cowardly platoon of muskets. Even to the end, the samurai honor code has been violated by the Clan.As Toshiro Mifune has long been associated with the success of Kurosawa's films, so are Kogayashi's films enhanced by the brilliant interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai (also staring in the leading roles in Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"",and ""Ran""). This outstanding actor contributed further to the success of this director's films, ""Kwaidan"" and the ""Samurai Rebellion."" The screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto is based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi The cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, in black and white, is gorgeous. Many on the shots are ""haiku-like"" in the imagery. The musical score, written for an ensemble of ancient instruments and percussion by the renowned classical composer Toru Takemitsu, is used sparingly throughout the film, reinforcing the dramatic moments.Masaki Kobayashi's film is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the establishment, any establishment, would it be in feudal 17th Century Japan or in any other time. Dogma, on which the establishment's authority rests, is evil. The established, codified order, with all its smoke and mirrors, must be preserved at all costs, and nothing must be allowed to come in its way. It is the duty of each member of any government, organization, church, or brotherhood not to spare any effort and to go to any length to protect the appearances and status quo, to achieve this essential goal of survival. The end justifies the means, and no lie or deceit can be eliminated if this survival is at stake.Although taking place almost five centuries ago during the Tokugawa Shogunate, this film is also a strong denunciation of the entrenched cultural legacy of coercive rituals, blind obedience, and chauvinism that resulted in the tragedy of the Pacific War.The outstanding screenplay, the superb acting, the cinematography and editing makes ""Harakiri"" the best samurai film ever.",honor hypocrisy,it would seem impossible that any samurai movie could surpass kurosawas ran kagemusha or even

8.0,"Eventually there is only one valid code of Honor, the Human one...","Masaki Kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at Shochiku studio. His oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. In the 1962 Hara-kiri aka Seppuku, we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between Human condition and Rigid Code of a feudal society. The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced ""mise en scène"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression. Most of Shambaras take place during the Edo Period but rather late in that period (just before the Meiji Era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the Samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. Here Masaki Kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630, 17th century Japan during the Edo period. At that time Japan was ruled by a Shogunate (Ieyasu Tokugawa). The Tokugawa Shoguns established Peace and continued to rule Japan for a remarkable 250 years. But such a long period of Peace had a price and Ieyasu Tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. He cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals, breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty. In the film an elder ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo, the hypnotic Tatsuya Nakadai (Goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of Seppuku as he can no longer stand his Life of Dishonor and Poverty. There, the administrator tells him about the fate of a young Samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. But there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. As the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. One is based on a Human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one. Masaki Kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. The film starts with the Display of a Samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. The armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. Can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the Human condition? This is in essence the question raised by ""Hara-kiri"". We see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened, as if changes in an given Society take some times to occur. Indeed social Progress has always been slow leaving Men and Women struggling with their condition. The suicidal ritual, Hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. Raw images of Ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962), still is today. In the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. It also symbolizes even for the Japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of Seppuku. In fact Hanshiro Tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of Love, Revenge and Sorrow, in short with humanity. With the film Hara-kiri, Masaki Kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. The script by Shinobu Hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama, in one word universal. Also writer of Jôi-uchi: Hairyô tsuma shimatsu aka Samurai Rebellion (1967), Dai-bosatsu tôge (1966) aka Sword of Doom or ""Hitokiri"" aka Tenchu (1969), Shinobu Hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th Art. I can not recommend Seppuku enough, every single frame, acting, piece of music is irreproachable. The story is profoundly Humanist, timeless and universal. I suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social Hara-kiri",eventually there is only one valid code honor human one,masaki kobayashi studied art philosophy before starting as assistant director at shochiku studio his oeuvre is guided by need understand human condition 1962 hara kiri aka seppuku we can clearly see philosophic influence this story about confrontation between human condition rigid code feudal society result this confrontation is multi layered masterpiece which clarity script perfection interpretation very well balanced mise en sc ne make powerful film based transgression genre transgression code transgression image transgression most shambaras take place during edo period but rather late that period just before meiji era as most filmmakers try romanticize glamorize period which marks end samurai thus playing nostalgia card here masaki kobayashi transgressed genre decided film story taking place 1630 17th century japan during edo period at that time japan was ruled by shogunate ieyasu tokugawa tokugawa shoguns established peace continued rule japan remarkable 250 years but such long period peace had price ieyasu tokugawa brought whole country under tight control he cleverly redistributed land among more loyal vassals breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands samurai into poverty film elder ronin hanshiro tsugumo hypnotic tatsuya nakadai goyokin seeks admittance house feudal lord commit act seppuku as he can no longer stand his life dishonor poverty there administrator tells him about fate young samurai who committed same suicidal ritual few times ago but there is much more this story soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another as film progresses we witness confrontation between two conceptions one is based human code other is based rigid traditional one masaki kobayashi uses both symbols raw images show this confrontation film starts with display samurai shining battle armor representing feudal system armor is empty anything human strongly symbolized feudal system can code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging human condition this is essence question raised by hara kiri we see this armor soiled dragged but at end film armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened as if changes given society take some times occur indeed social progress has always been slow leaving men women struggling with their condition suicidal ritual hara kiri reinforced sense cruelty raw images ronin opening their stomach with sword were transgression at that time 1962 still is today film ritual is portrayed non glamorized way very realistically it also symbolizes even japanese audience lack sense act seppuku fact hanshiro tsugumo is only one giving meaning this act by motivating it with mixed feelings love revenge sorrow short with humanity with film hara kiri masaki kobayashi signed one greatest philosophical films script by shinobu hashimoto is good example how make story clear but more importantly sufficient enough anybody understand drama one word universal also writer j i uchi hairy tsuma shimatsu aka samurai rebellion 1967 dai bosatsu t ge 1966 aka sword doom or hitokiri aka tenchu 1969 shinobu hashimoto is among greatest writers 7th art i can not recommend seppuku enough every single frame acting piece music is irreproachable story is profoundly humanist timeless universal i suggest we all confront codes our respective societies order find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards terrible social hara kiri,0.43005215123859203,0.1109626249456758,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,A classic!,"A classic, surviving the test of time -- made in 1962 about 17th century people. Here in 2005, we still watch and discuss the film and the issues that it raises. Tsugumo Hanshiro, a middle-aged ronin formerly serving a clan abolished by the Shogunate, appears at the Ii clan gate. He wishes to commit seppuku rather than live on in poverty. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu, the chief retainer, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku. Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro. He tells a tale of another ronin from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome. Motome had appeared a few months earlier, with a request, but had carried bamboo sword blades  the clan members had been enraged. As an example to other scrounging ronin, particularly those without real blades, the clan decided to force Motome to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Hanshiro tells his own life story. The film shows us some historical background. Thousands of ex-retainers had been thrown out of their positions, made into ronin, by the Shogunate's abolishing of clans. In the rigid class system (samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants), these displaced ex-retainers had no place at all, being forced into marginal subsistence. Most trades (because they required long periods of apprenticeship) were out for most ronin. Many ronin became outlaws or obtained bodyguard positions for gangsters. If law-abiding, they were able to teach in schools for commoner children. Or become piecework artisans; they could contract with wholesalers (who also lent money) to make fans, umbrellas, insect cages, ink brushes, and the like. Even as most ronin had to fend for themselves in this netherworld, they still were to carry the two swords of their original rank, and to uphold their obligations. Hanshiro and his daughter Miho make umbrellas and fans to sell to wholesalers for a pittance; Hanshiro is in debt to one of the wholesalers. Motome teaches commoner children and receives a minimal wage for his work. Miho and Motome marry and have a son. All goes well until sickness strikes. Miho contracts consumption and the child contracts a fever. Neither Hanshiro nor Motome can afford a doctor. Motome attempts to get a laborer job (which pays more than teaching does) and runs straight into job discrimination: ""no starving ronin need apply."" Motome sells his sword blades at a pawnshop, obtaining bamboo blades to wear inside his sword fittings, not an uncommon practice; some ronin (and some low-ranked clan samurai) desperately needed money. And yet, the sword was considered to be ""the soul of the bushi."" A bushi who sold his blades had to appear to wear the badge of his rank. The bamboo blades were available, thus no one would know of the despicable act of having sold his ""soul"" for money.But Motome has not received enough; he still cannot afford a doctor. So Motome decides on something more desperate: to appear at a clan gate, with his hidden bamboo blades, in order to request seppuku -- with the actual intention of receiving a handout to get a doctor for his wife and child. The Ii clan officials have decided differently. The scene where Motome must commit seppuku with his bamboo wakizashi is one of the most harrowing scenes ever filmed. Motome is utterly humiliated, surrounded by the Ii clan retainers, with Onodaka Hikokuro, his assigned second preaching on how the sword is the soul of the samurai, the bamboo sword is what is appropriate for Motome, and so forth. While Motome painfully carries forth. Hikokuro refuses Motome's request to cut off his head and end the ritual's mockery, so Motome ends it himself, biting off his tongue. Hanshiro has realized -- too late -- that he had never dared to even consider selling his own sword blades to help out the family. The scene when he is confronted with Motome's body and the truth of what has happened is truly gut-wrenching, as Hanshiro weeps and slams down his ""useless tokens"" that he had clung to. Hanshiro reveals his own secret  he has used his ""useless tokens"" to avenge Motome's death. He has tracked down the three Ii retainers who were most responsible for Motome's death. The final duel between Hanshiro and Onodaka Hikokuro is absolutely stunning. Instead of taking the lives of these three, Hanshiro has taken their topknots. And while Kageyu has preached to Hanshiro about samurai honor, these three swordsmen have hidden themselves away, claiming sickness to cover up their own shame, while their topknots grow back. Kageyu cannot deal with Hanshiro's revelations. He commands his men to slaughter Hanshiro. Hanshiro fights back gamely, taking four of the Ii clan retainers and wounding several more. In a symbolic scene, he tears down the ancestral armor of the Ii clan. Some Ii clansmen use their rifles against Hanshiro, but Hanshiro sticks his own sword into his belly, committing seppuku as he has pledged to do. In the end, Kageyu fashions a cover-up of the entire event; mysterious plagues have hit the Ii clan and a number of their retainers, including Onodaka, have died of ""illness"" rather than by the blade of an impoverished hungry ronin. This film raises many issues. It is Kobayashi's impassioned protest against rigidly militaristic societies that uphold hypocritical codes of ""bushido"" while disdaining what that term really means. The film is also like a Greek tragedy, with a character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) possessing the tragic flaw of his own pride -- which in the end, he must pay for with his life. Which he does in a heroic way. This film doesn't just recount the oppression of poor people. It shows the strength that these poor people have, the choices that they make as individuals, refusing to just bow down and be mere victims of their society.",classic,classic surviving test time made

It is really a tremendous example of outstanding film making! The cinematography is absolutely exceptional!

9.0,Gripping critique of bushido,"This film ranks as a masterpiece among samurai films for its humanistic critique of the rigid, hierarchical bushido code of conduct. The samurai who espouse this code are depicted as either malicious or enslaved by its snare - reduced to begging or arbitrarily enforcing it as a tool of humiliation. The story unfolds in a gradual way, revealing how all the characters have interacted in the past, bringing a lot of context to the situation in the courtyard. This is all punctuated with skillful cinematography of claustrophobic architecture, heartfelt acting and desperate swordfights.",gripping critique bushido,this film ranks as masterpiece among samurai films its humanistic critique rigid hierarchical bushido code conduct samurai who espouse this code are depicted as either malicious or enslaved by its snare reduced begging or arbitrarily enforcing it as tool humiliation story unfolds gradual way revealing how all characters have interacted past bringing lot context situation courtyard this is all punctuated with skillful cinematography claustrophobic architecture heartfelt acting desperate swordfights,0.6571428571428571,-0.17142857142857143,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Exceeded expectations! Near perfect! Better than every Kurosawa film,"Harakiri is an outsatanding and underrated Japanese masterpiece. It seems to be heavily overshadowed by so-called magnum opuses like seven samurai. However, this samurai film was truly incredible in almost every way. The visuals and the themes complimented each other perfectly. It really shed light on the samurai experience like no film before and subverts expectations with regards to numerous samurai cliches.The recurring mood of this movie is deceitful. Nothing should be interpreted at face value. Our protagonist Tsugumo enters seemingly disturbing the peace at the honorable House of Iyi. He even wears a dark outfit, deceiving one into thinking that he is evil in nature. One would expect that Tsugumo would promptly carry out his ""wish"" of dying honorably. Given that we know nothing about him and that the camera often keeps physical distance from him, he initially does not evoke pity. However he repeatedly prolongs the ritual, much to the annoyance of Sennukko. And Tsugumo finally tells his grand tale which subverts all of our expectations. It's revealed that he is the victim of corrupt government policies initiated by indifferent upper-class elites. He is really out to vent his grievances in front members of the elite.But the film doesn't stop there. Part of its magic was just truly how unpredictable it was. Not only was Tsugumo lying in his intentions, he revealed that three of his proposed ""seconds"" to his harakiri were not sick at all, but could not face the humiliation of losing their buns. The final lines in the film in which sennukko orders the events of the film to be whitewashed to preserve the House's dignity, accentuates the theme of subversion. This is supported when the camera cuts at some of the most climactic moments. While not my original observation, I'd like to echo other reviews in acknowledging how in every death or samurai battle, we never actually see anyone die, or have their hair cut off. It's as if the audience is denied the convenience of being eyewitnesses and instead must accept Sennukko's words with submission.I've read how this film, while taking place in the 17th century, has striking parallels to Japanese institutions during WWII, however I admit to being no aficionado on Japanese history.This was my interpretation of the film. Samurais are often depicted as saviors and honorable warriors (ahem all of kurosawa's films), but this interpretation of them has to be the most pitiful and revealing.In terms of entertainment value, this film was easily 10/10. We grow intrigued as our bereaved protagonist asks to commit ritual suicide after facing poverty. We then have to witness the cringy demise of one previous man named Chijiwa. As we are awaiting Tsugumo to succumb to the same fate, he creates tension by interrupting the procedure with his own anecdotes, where we learn an emotional backstory surrounding the loss of his job and ALL of his immediate family. As if this weren't intriguing enough, the suspense is cranked up when Tsugumo reveals how he retrieved the hair buns and preaches about the evil workings of the ruling class. The ending is a well earned and a well executed climax of realistic and authentic fight choreography for the time the film was made.Again, I don't know how historically accurate this film was and I'm certain many inevitably dismissed it as political propaganda, but the execution of this movie from a filmmaking standard was near meticulous in my opinion.Best Samurai film and probably the best foreign film I've ever seen! 10/10.",exceeded expectations near perfect better than every kurosawa film,harakiri is outsatanding underrated japanese masterpiece it seems be heavily overshadowed by so called magnum opuses like seven samurai however this samurai film was truly incredible almost every way visuals themes complimented each other perfectly it really shed light samurai experience like no film before subverts expectations with regards numerous samurai cliches recurring mood this movie is deceitful nothing should be interpreted at face value our protagonist tsugumo enters seemingly disturbing peace at honorable house iyi he even wears dark outfit deceiving one into thinking that he is evil nature one would expect that tsugumo would promptly carry out his wish dying honorably given that we know nothing about him that camera often keeps physical distance him he initially does not evoke pity however he repeatedly prolongs ritual much annoyance sennukko tsugumo finally tells his grand tale which subverts all our expectations its revealed that he is victim corrupt government policies initiated by indifferent upper class elites he is really out vent his grievances front members elite but film doesnt stop there part its magic was just truly how unpredictable it was not only was tsugumo lying his intentions he revealed that three his proposed seconds his harakiri were not sick at all but could not face humiliation losing their buns final lines film which sennukko orders events film be whitewashed preserve houses dignity accentuates theme subversion this is supported when camera cuts at some most climactic moments while not my original observation id like echo other reviews acknowledging how every death or samurai battle we never actually see anyone die or have their hair cut off its as if audience is denied convenience being eyewitnesses instead must accept sennukkos words with submission ive read how this film while taking place 17th century has striking parallels japanese institutions during wwii however i admit being no aficionado japanese history this was my interpretation film samurais are often depicted as saviors honorable warriors ahem all kurosawas films but this interpretation them has be most pitiful revealing terms entertainment value this film was easily 10 10 we grow intrigued as our bereaved protagonist asks commit ritual suicide after facing poverty we then have witness cringy demise one previous man named chijiwa as we are awaiting tsugumo succumb same fate he creates tension by interrupting procedure with his own anecdotes where we learn emotional backstory surrounding loss his job all his immediate family as if this werent intriguing enough suspense is cranked up when tsugumo reveals how he retrieved hair buns preaches about evil workings ruling class ending is well earned well executed climax realistic authentic fight choreography time film was made again i dont know how historically accurate this film was im certain many inevitably dismissed it as political propaganda but execution this movie filmmaking standard was near meticulous my opinion best samurai film probably best foreign film ive ever seen 10 10,0.507685881370092,0.13356307435254805,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,Sadly Overlooked,"An elder ronin samurai (Tatsuya Nakadai) arrives at a feudal lord's home and requests an honorable place to commit suicide. But when the ronin inquires about a younger samurai (Akira Ishihama) who arrived before him things take an unexpected turn.For many, samurai films may be closer associated with Kurosawa... but this one, possibly the best ever made, comes from Masaki Kobayashi. How does Kobayashi not have the same level of international fame as Kurosawa? Interestingly, Hanshirō is able to fight off a great many retainers with a sword, yet is helpless against three guns; this is a foreshadow of the Meiji Restoration, wherein sword-bearing samurai were defeated by the ""new"" Japanese military. Indeed, the whole notion of ""honor"" and all that comes with it is radically changed once the battles become uneven.",sadly overlooked,elder ronin samurai tatsuya nakadai arrives at feudal lords home requests honorable place commit suicide but when ronin inquires about younger samurai akira ishihama who arrived before him things take unexpected turn many samurai films may be closer associated with kurosawa but this one possibly best ever made comes masaki kobayashi how does kobayashi not have same level international fame as kurosawa interestingly hanshir is able fight off great many retainers with sword yet is helpless against three guns this is foreshadow meiji restoration wherein sword bearing samurai were defeated by new japanese military indeed whole notion honor all that comes with it is radically changed once battles become uneven,0.4034090909090909,0.21477272727272728,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.26}"

And that's probably the only reason how I even found out that this film existed at all.This is why I love movies, when you think you've seen it all, old films like this one just hits you with surprises you weren't even aware of could be in films as early as this one. And for a film about a ritual suicide, I've not been so excited and burst out in laughter in a long time as I did with this one. But I'm not going to say more, because the less you know seeing this film, the better - even the current plot summary on the films page gives away too much, and I'm just happy I didn't read it as I started watching this film. All I can say is that with the fame Kurosawa and Mifune have with their samurai film, I just hope that Masaki Kobayashi and Tatsuya Nakadai will be more known to the world as time goes by, they belong up there with the masters.Currently at the 33th spot on the top 250 list when I'm writing this text, I can only see it go higher with time when more people discover this gem of a film.",only reason this isnt higher imdb 250 is because not enough people have seen it yet,ive set myself this task see all films top 250 list which end will be impossible task because it changes every day thats probably only reason how i even found out that this film existed at all this is why i love movies when you think youve seen it all old films like this one just hits you with surprises you werent even aware could be films as early as this one film about ritual suicide ive not been so excited burst out laughter long time as i did with this one but im not going say more because less you know seeing this film better even current plot summary films page gives away too much im just happy i didnt read it as i started watching this film all i can say is that with fame kurosawa mifune have with their samurai film i just hope that masaki kobayashi tatsuya nakadai will be more known world as time goes by they belong up there with masters currently at 33th spot top 250 list when im writing this text i can only see it go higher with time when more people discover this gem film,0.5444444444444444,0.20590277777777777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,"""I came here with every intention of dying.""","Unlike all the Kurosawa films I've seen, this one has a principal protagonist that announces his intention early in the story and then takes the viewer on a stunning journey of revenge that's entirely unexpected. Director Masaki Kobayashi prepares the viewer with a preliminary accounting of the fate of thousands of unemployed Samurai as a result of the 17th Century dissolution of the Japanese Shogunate. Masterless Samurai, or ronin, appear at the doorstep of a feudal lord requesting a place in which to perform ritual suicide, but for the dishonorable, this effort is merely a ploy to accept some small token of monetary value before moving on. ""Harakiri"" tells the story of two such ronin, and until we learn the true relationship of both men to each other, the viewer is at a loss to understand the real motivation of Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai). With frequent forays into the past utilizing a series of flashbacks, Tsugumo relates the story of his son-in-law, helpless in the face of his wife's deteriorating physical condition and unable to seek medical attention for their sick baby due to lack of resources. What I found quite clever about the story was the absence of the three men Tsugumo called for to be his seconds for the purpose of hara-kiri. One realizes that it can't be simple coincidence that none of these men are available, as the story swerves to a desperate climax that pits Tsugumo against the entire House of Iyi. What would have been a tremendous let down in the story is avoided when Tsugumo follows through on his original mission, unable to physically overpower all the retainers employed by the clan's Master. So many films have the story's hero defeat an overwhelming number of rival opponents that it reduces the credibility factor to zero. At the point Tsugumo knows he can no longer pursue a fight strategy, he takes his life in the ritual manner. For followers of Japanese cinema, this film is a must see, with it's emphasis on honor, loyalty and embracing the truth of one's convictions. Tsugumo's unselfish final act unmasks the hypocrisy of the feudal lord's position, and mocks the cowardice of it's counselor Saito (Rentarô Mikuni). An appropriate amount of swordplay attends the story without becoming excessive, allowing for the more subtle aspects of Tsugumo's strategy to take over the narrative, which it does in compelling fashion.",i came here with every intention dying,unlike all kurosawa films ive seen this one has principal protagonist that announces his intention early story then takes viewer stunning journey revenge thats entirely unexpected director masaki kobayashi prepares viewer with preliminary accounting fate thousands unemployed samurai as result 17th century dissolution japanese shogunate masterless samurai or ronin appear at doorstep feudal lord requesting place which perform ritual suicide but dishonorable this effort is merely ploy accept some small token monetary value before moving harakiri tells story two such ronin until we learn true relationship both men each other viewer is at loss understand real motivation hanshiro tsugumo tatsuya nakadai with frequent forays into past utilizing series flashbacks tsugumo relates story his son law helpless face his wifes deteriorating physical condition unable seek medical attention their sick baby due lack resources what i found quite clever about story was absence three men tsugumo called be his seconds purpose hara kiri one realizes that it cant be simple coincidence that none these men are available as story swerves desperate climax that pits tsugumo against entire house iyi what would have been tremendous let down story is avoided when tsugumo follows through his original mission unable physically overpower all retainers employed by clans master so many films have storys hero defeat overwhelming number rival opponents that it reduces credibility factor zero at point tsugumo knows he can no longer pursue fight strategy he takes his life ritual manner followers japanese cinema this film is must see with its emphasis honor loyalty embracing truth ones convictions tsugumos unselfish final act unmasks hypocrisy feudal lords position mocks cowardice its counselor saito rentar mikuni appropriate amount swordplay attends story without becoming excessive allowing more subtle aspects tsugumos strategy take over narrative which it does compelling fashion,0.5209795321637427,0.02787698412698412,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.35}"
