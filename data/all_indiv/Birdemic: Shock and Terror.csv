1.0,"A ""must-see"" movie. Really. I'm not kidding.","Don't be fooled by the rating. You have to watch ""Birdemic"" at some point.This movies outshines ""Troll 2"" in every respect. It puts ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""The Room"" to shame. Imagine a movie that would be created solely to give film students a paper topic on how NOT to make movies. Every conceivable error has been made in making ""Birdemic."" At first, you simply won't be able to believe that the film is not a spoof. But if you read about the film and about Nguyen, and if you take a few moments to watch the additional material on the DVD, you will soon agree that this was just a misguided effort on the entire production team's part.The sound is the most outstanding example of sheer incompetence. The director clearly understood what Foley is, since the gunshots have all been added post-production, but I guess they just didn't have the time or money to dub the vast majority of the film after shooting. And it needs it. Badly.The acting is uniformly terrible. Not bad. Terrible. Alan Bragh doesn't even rise to the level of fourth grade pageants. Whitney Moore is cute as a button and is aided by a bit of camel-toe in at least one scene, but she's the best of a poor lot. All the supporting cast is ""give your financial backers a small part"" bad.If you want to explain blocking, editing, framing, sound markers, continuity, reverse shots, and other film terms to your friends, this is the film to use. None of it is done correctly.While the CGI (and I use the term in only the broadest sense) birds are hilarious, my favorite scene is the ""retirement"" scene. I think that the word ""retirement"" is used six times in just three lines. Watch for it. It's hard to miss.BUT...it's strangely watchable. In contrast to many bad movies, it's not boring. Consider it a train wreck that you simply can't tear your eyes from. Even the boring scenes (and there really aren't that many) have some aspect (poor sound, hilariously unrealistic dialogue, odd things going on in the background) that fascinate. You'll be giggling and poking your elbow into the side of the person beside you.So, go rent it. Really. You won't regret it.",must see movie really im not kidding,dont be fooled by rating you have watch birdemic at some point this movies outshines troll 2 every respect it puts plan 9 outer space room shame imagine movie that would be created solely give film students paper topic how not make movies every conceivable error has been made making birdemic at first you simply wont be able believe that film is not spoof but if you read about film about nguyen if you take few moments watch additional material dvd you will soon agree that this was just misguided effort entire production teams part sound is most outstanding example sheer incompetence director clearly understood what foley is since gunshots have all been added post production but i guess they just didnt have time or money dub vast majority film after shooting it needs it badly acting is uniformly terrible not bad terrible alan bragh doesnt even rise level fourth grade pageants whitney moore is cute as button is aided by bit camel toe at least one scene but shes best poor lot all supporting cast is give your financial backers small part bad if you want explain blocking editing framing sound markers continuity reverse shots other film terms your friends this is film use none it is done correctly while cgi i use term only broadest sense birds are hilarious my favorite scene is retirement scene i think that word retirement is used six times just three lines watch it its hard miss but its strangely watchable contrast many bad movies its not boring consider it train wreck that you simply cant tear your eyes even boring scenes there really arent that many have some aspect poor sound hilariously unrealistic dialogue odd things going background that fascinate youll be giggling poking your elbow into side person beside you so go rent it really you wont regret it,0.5233178053830227,0.022101449275362322,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.19}"
2.0,"a film for our times, for ALL times, or perhaps none at all....","Sometimes there is a film that comes along that boggles the mind. You cannot believe the thing exists, but there it is, paddling its arms forward like a Special Olympics finalist (and no, this is not a joke on the Special Olympics - they're too good for Birdemic: Shock and Terror). The movie tricks a viewer like yours truly; at first, having not seen anything made by its director, the inimitable James Nguyen - he has two other films to his credit, Replica and Julie and Jack, neither seen by me (just as well, one of whom gives its highest praise as ""Ed Wood quality"" on IMDb) - I wasn't sure what I was really seeing, if it was either the highest or lowest of artistic expression.The film takes place in some sunny seaside community on the California coast - as we're made PAINFULLY CLEAR in the opening from-the-car driving shots (immediately calling to mind the opening credits of Manos: The Hands of Fate) - and is about how Rod (Alan Bough) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore), who meet one day by chance, he a successful solar-panel salesman and she a Victoria's Secret model (she just made the cover!) Oh, and there's an almost inexplicable warning of a crazy-killer bird epidemic on the news, from, um, I guess it's global warming. And after about a half hour of almost *nothing* going on between these two pieces of cardboard-as-actors, the birds finally arrive.... oh yes, how they arrive.What I mean by my uncertainty of what I was seeing, it felt like a double-edged sword. I kept thinking during the film, 'either Nguyen is a total genius, crafting the most intentionally bad movie in recent memory, or he's quite possible the most sickening hack you've never wanted to meet.' It's one thing that the film was shot on a shitty camcorder. It's another that the actors appear to be non-professionals or at best from community theater (Alan Bagh is so stiff he just might make your eyes bleed; Moore is too hot to have that happen, though her talent is just as nill).But it's something else how absolutely, and surprisingly consistently, awful the film-making is. Even if you've never taken a class in proper lighting or sound or stage direction or editing, Birdemic shines so mightily in its crap-ness. Scenes start and end without a proper marker, as if the editor didn't know how to flow from one scene- one SHOT- to the next. Sound is completely mis-matched from one shot to the next. The music is the kind of synthesizer work that cranked up loud enough could drive Bin-Laden out of his cave (they even go as far as to rip-off the John Lennon song ""Imagine"" for a girl character wearing a ""Imagine Peace"" shirt. And the birds... oh, boy, the birds (if you need further proof, watch the trailer, do yourself a favor and get it out of the way).Now, again, experiencing this film, especially in the case I had in a theater with people perhaps anticipating its awfulness based on the trailer or the website or the claim by Nguyen to be a ""Master of the Romantic Thriller"" (Trademarked. I'm not kidding), that this is perhaps just a brilliant prank, a satire of epic proportions. Certainly the ""message"" part of the movie- and it's wielded with such a sledgehammer it would make Stanley Kramer look like Jim Jarmusch - is done to such a ludicrous extent, with characters appearing for walk-on scenes like a Old-man Biologist who appears to explain that the birds were caused by man's harm to the planet, or the ""Tree-Man"" in the woods who has a tree-house home and finds the birds don't attack him because he's in the woods and not out on the road like the rest of stupid man-animal civilization. Not to mention the rather *listen to us now* attitude of the main characters driving their hybrid cars and seeing An Inconvenient Truth (I s**t you not, this is in the movie) and their silly solar panels. Who ever heard of that working really well? All of this could, potentially, really be just a put-on of such a magnitude that I would want to shake Nguyen's hand for pulling off such a feat. But, no, Nguyen took himself very seriously during this production, only slightly changing his tune after the fact of people seeing the film like the audience in The Producers seeing ""Springtime for Hitler"" for the first time (if you need proof, look at this NY Times article quote: ""I never went to film school,"" Mr. Nguyen said. ""But I did go to what you'd call the film school of Hitchcock cinema.""). I'll give him that he had persistence in getting the film out there, even showing it in bars around the Sundance film festival when he couldn't get in. The masses of sober people puking all around him should have given him a clearer idea of what he had though.Oh, don't get me wrong, Birdemic is absolutely, hysterically, historically, gloriously funny. It's a magnificent fresco of horrible CGI (the birds just float, like a screensaver), and non-existent acting, and plot that... wait, what plot? And who needs an ending that makes sense either, or shots that match up? It's so funny that I ended up feeling just a wee-bit guilty by the end. It's easy to mock this movie, like a bully on the playground mocking the kid with Cerebal Palsy. If the film isn't an intentional anti-film, then it's just a really bad Manos/Ed-Wood level movie, and all of the hilarity that ensues from it is kind of expected. It's not even worthy of Asylum DVD status. Alongside The Room, After Last Season, and Severed Ways, it's one of the real no-budget bad-movie finds of the past ten years. A must-see, for every wrong reason imaginable.",film our times all times or perhaps none at all,sometimes there is film that comes along that boggles mind you cannot believe thing exists but there it is paddling its arms forward like special olympics finalist no this is not joke special olympics theyre too good birdemic shock terror movie tricks viewer like yours truly at first having not seen anything made by its director inimitable james nguyen he has two other films his credit replica julie jack neither seen by me just as well one whom gives its highest praise as ed wood quality imdb i wasnt sure what i was really seeing if it was either highest or lowest artistic expression film takes place some sunny seaside community california coast as were made painfully clear opening car driving shots immediately calling mind opening credits manos hands fate is about how rod alan bough nathalie whitney moore who meet one day by chance he successful solar panel salesman she victorias secret model she just made cover oh theres almost inexplicable warning crazy killer bird epidemic news um i guess its global warming after about half hour almost nothing going between these two pieces cardboard as actors birds finally arrive oh yes how they arrive what i mean by my uncertainty what i was seeing it felt like double edged sword i kept thinking during film either nguyen is total genius crafting most intentionally bad movie recent memory or hes quite possible most sickening hack youve never wanted meet its one thing that film was shot shitty camcorder its another that actors appear be non professionals or at best community theater alan bagh is so stiff he just might make your eyes bleed moore is too hot have that happen though her talent is just as nill but its something else how absolutely surprisingly consistently awful film making is even if youve never taken class proper lighting or sound or stage direction or editing birdemic shines so mightily its crap ness scenes start end without proper marker as if editor didnt know how flow one scene one shot next sound is completely mis matched one shot next music is kind synthesizer work that cranked up loud enough could drive bin laden out his cave they even go as far as rip off john lennon song imagine girl character wearing imagine peace shirt birds oh boy birds if you need further proof watch trailer do yourself favor get it out way now again experiencing this film especially case i had theater with people perhaps anticipating its awfulness based trailer or website or claim by nguyen be master romantic thriller trademarked im not kidding that this is perhaps just brilliant prank satire epic proportions certainly message part movie its wielded with such sledgehammer it would make stanley kramer look like jim jarmusch is done such ludicrous extent with characters appearing walk scenes like old man biologist who appears explain that birds were caused by mans harm planet or tree man woods who has tree house home finds birds dont attack him because hes woods not out road like rest stupid man animal civilization not mention rather listen us now attitude main characters driving their hybrid cars seeing inconvenient truth i s t you not this is movie their silly solar panels who ever heard that working really well all this could potentially really be just put such magnitude that i would want shake nguyens hand pulling off such feat but no nguyen took himself very seriously during this production only slightly changing his tune after fact people seeing film like audience producers seeing springtime hitler first time if you need proof look at this ny times article quote i never went film school mr nguyen said but i did go what youd call film school hitchcock cinema ill give him that he had persistence getting film out there even showing it bars around sundance film festival when he couldnt get masses sober people puking all around him should have given him clearer idea what he had though oh dont get me wrong birdemic is absolutely hysterically historically gloriously funny its magnificent fresco horrible cgi birds just float like screensaver non existent acting plot that wait what plot who needs ending that makes sense either or shots that match up its so funny that i ended up feeling just wee bit guilty by end its easy mock this movie like bully playground mocking kid with cerebal palsy if film isnt intentional anti film then its just really bad manos ed wood level movie all hilarity that ensues it is kind expected its not even worthy asylum dvd status alongside room after last season severed ways its one real no budget bad movie finds past ten years must see every wrong reason imaginable,0.584214380196523,0.0015093537414966104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,"The worst film made by anyone, ever, at anytime","There are no words that come to mind after seeing this film. Travesty, horrific, absurd, ridiculous, and mind-numbingly stupid all come to mind but none of 'em quite describe just how awful this ""film"" really is. To see where everyone went wrong, let's break it down!1. It takes 45 minutes until the actual plot begins to develop. By this time, the majority of viewers have fallen asleep or have taken their own lives.2. The actor who plays Rod, Alan Bagh. He makes me miss Nicholas Cage. NO NOT THE BEES!!! AHHHH!!!3. The birds. What do they do exactly? Nothing. The birds come down and fly directly in front of the victims face. Then they die for reasons only criminally insane director James Nguyen knows. God help us.4. Read my parental advisory5. ""Hey I thought I told you to stand back. These birds are contaminated""6. What is wrong with Rod's friend? And why can't he get a good looking girlfriend?7. The dialogue. It's like watching a poorly translated foreign film. ""I like you and because you are pretty to me"" ""I thank you this words they make me happy"" ""Yaaaaaayyy...""8. This quote: ""Why would birds do something like that? Why would they just attack"" ""......I don't know""-------The good?1. Thank god for Whitney Moore in lingerie.

1.0,"Definitely on the ""best of the worst"" list","Let's be honest, if you even got as far as reading this review, then you're not looking for a good movie, so there's a good chance Birdemic is the movie for you. On the other hand, let me give you some practical advice; just start the movie at minute 47, because nothing of any real importance happens in the first half. It's entirely spent establishing an implausible relationship between a Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a hot fashion model and a Rod (Alan Bagh), computer geek. I know this sort of thing is a staple in horror and sci fi movies, but usually the nerd has some hidden charms. Rod is basically just annoying and full of himself. Also, the relationship normally develops in the context of the plot and involves at least *some* dramatic tension. In this case, they meet and she is immediately swept off her feet by his complete lack of charm and affected speech patterns. Oh yeah, he's also just landed a big business deal that will make him a millionaire. So much more Nathalie's wholesome image, the little gold digger! Anyway, this whole process takes about 5 minutes. Where the other 40 go is a mystery. OK, they do find one dead bird on the beach. Consider yourself foreshadowed.On second thought, start at minute 44 to catch the movie's only redeeming feature: a gratuitous slow pan of Moore in her underwear. But then *immediately* jump to minute 47 to escape the most awkward and unconvincing love scene in the history of cinema. Don't say you haven't been warned.Then the action starts. After a night of passion, they awake to a full scale attack by badly rendered CGI birds which terrorize people and occasionally dive bomb the ground, exploding on impact. I don't mean they burst apart in a shower of bird guts; I mean they actually explode, with fire and smoke, like little Kamikazee pilots! This is never explained.And that's pretty much it. The rest of the movie is basically spent running from these birds and occasionally fighting them off - first with coat hangers and later with the the stash of firearms and (almost) limitless ammo that one character inexplicably produces. Sometimes there's a variation on the explosion theme where the birds splatter people with something that appears to burn them like acid. They run into a couple of people in their travels who explain this is all caused by global warming. This shameless pandering to social relevance loses any sympathy the film maker might otherwise have had. Also, I can believe that climate change might make birds aggressive, but could it really make them explode?Just how bad an actor is Alan Bagh? Well, it should tell you something that he couldn't project any credible passion in a love scene with our scantily clad heroine. His dialog is delivered in a uniform stilted monotone, and he seems to avoid eye contact with either the camera or any of his fellow actors. In fact, even the scenes when he and Moore are walking in silence - and there are an annoyingly large number of these - are somehow not at all believable. I mean seriously, how hard is it to *walk* in a convincing manner? If I saw someone walking like that on the street, I would assume he had suffered some sort of head trauma.Almost all of the actors are more or less equivalent to Bagh, with the arguable exception of Moore. Don't get me wrong, she's not great, but since she's the only person in the movie with any acting ability whatsoever, she comes across like Merryl Streep. Really, you find yourself longing for her speaking parts, because it's the only dialog that's doesn't literally make you cringe. Also, did I mention she's got a gratuitous underwear scene at minute 44?A lot has been said about the poor quality of the CGI birds, but nothing can prepare you for how bad they really are. If Ed Wood had made this movie, he would have interspersed stock footage of flocks of birds with stuffed birds thrown in from off screen - and the result would have been much, much more effective!Anyway, since they're worried about bird attacks, you would think they would, I don't know, stay indoors! By no, they're outside as much as possible. Part of this is because in the one day since the birds attacked civilization has completely crumbled, and they're forced to forage for food. Just when you're continuing to wonder how they're going to end this this thing, the birds simply fly away, with no explanation. Huh?Truly, a masterpiece.",definitely best worst list,lets be honest if you even got as far as reading this review then youre not looking good movie so theres good chance birdemic is movie you other hand let me give you some practical advice just start movie at minute 47 because nothing any real importance happens first half its entirely spent establishing implausible relationship between nathalie whitney moore hot fashion model rod alan bagh computer geek i know this sort thing is staple horror sci fi movies but usually nerd has some hidden charms rod is basically just annoying full himself also relationship normally develops context plot involves at least some dramatic tension this case they meet she is immediately swept off her feet by his complete lack charm affected speech patterns oh yeah hes also just landed big business deal that will make him millionaire so much more nathalies wholesome image little gold digger anyway this whole process takes about 5 minutes where other 40 go is mystery ok they do find one dead bird beach consider yourself foreshadowed second thought start at minute 44 catch movies only redeeming feature gratuitous slow pan moore her underwear but then immediately jump minute 47 escape most awkward unconvincing love scene history cinema dont say you havent been warned then action starts after night passion they awake full scale attack by badly rendered cgi birds which terrorize people occasionally dive bomb ground exploding impact i dont mean they burst apart shower bird guts i mean they actually explode with fire smoke like little kamikazee pilots this is never explained thats pretty much it rest movie is basically spent running these birds occasionally fighting them off first with coat hangers later with stash firearms almost limitless ammo that one character inexplicably produces sometimes theres variation explosion theme where birds splatter people with something that appears burn them like acid they run into couple people their travels who explain this is all caused by global warming this shameless pandering social relevance loses any sympathy film maker might otherwise have had also i can believe that climate change might make birds aggressive but could it really make them explode just how bad actor is alan bagh well it should tell you something that he couldnt project any credible passion love scene with our scantily clad heroine his dialog is delivered uniform stilted monotone he seems avoid eye contact with either camera or any his fellow actors fact even scenes when he moore are walking silence there are annoyingly large number these are somehow not at all believable i mean seriously how hard is it walk convincing manner if i saw someone walking like that street i would assume he had suffered some sort head trauma almost all actors are more or less equivalent bagh with arguable exception moore dont get me wrong shes not great but since shes only person movie with any acting ability whatsoever she comes across like merryl streep really you find yourself longing her speaking parts because its only dialog thats doesnt literally make you cringe also did i mention shes got gratuitous underwear scene at minute 44 lot has been said about poor quality cgi birds but nothing can prepare you how bad they really are if ed wood had made this movie he would have interspersed stock footage flocks birds with stuffed birds thrown off screen result would have been much much more effective anyway since theyre worried about bird attacks you would think they would i dont know stay indoors by no theyre outside as much as possible part this is because one day since birds attacked civilization has completely crumbled theyre forced forage food just when youre continuing wonder how theyre going end this this thing birds simply fly away with no explanation huh truly masterpiece,0.500195993031359,0.013741289198606274,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.18, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1.0,Top Forty Things I Took From Birdemic,"1. Angry birds do, in fact, drop bombs. Only, they explode. Literally. I'm not kidding.2. Shock and Terror? Check and Check.3. All film class's first assignment should be a full length movie, such as Birdemic, so by the semester's end you can see why you really did need the class.4. Make that, if Birdemic was your intro film, then go ahead and pay for the same course for another three semesters. Actually, just drop out.5. Repeating a 30sec music track in order to fill up a 4min opening credit screen does not deserve a ""Music by"" recognition.6. Sometimes 20-minute films that stem from a 2-minute idea can, sadly, be stretched to 90 minutes.7. If Hitchcock was resurrected to watch this remake: 'Birds,' he'd only sue the people who brought him back.8. To close a $1,000,000 sales call, simply thank them for their business, hang up and smile.9. To persuade investors to give $10 million dollars, a one-slide PowerPoint presentation should seal the deal. Remember just to keep pointing at it for emphasis.10. Kids prefer HappyMeals over seaweed. Go figure.11. Nintendo's DuckHunt not only had better graphics, but actually produced more realistic birds (and guns) in ""combat.""12. No real birds were harmed in the production. I repeat: No real birds13. Al Gore not only changed his stance on GlobalWarming following Birdemic's release, but he spit on Director/Writer Nguyen before converting to Republicanism.14. At least Tommy Wiseau's The Room was trying to be funny. At least Piranha3D knew what kind of movie it was.15. As bad of actors that were in this feature, they must've learned something for acting scared of these ""birds"" that were as menacing as finches. 16. Sure, it's billed as a Birds reduxit's just as much a Beauty & the Beast remake: Just check out daughter, Nathalie and her monster of a mother. 17. At least M. Night does make the effort to edit something. 18. Twilight now seems surprisingly more romantic. 19. I don't have the $10,000 budget this movie had, but if I did, I'd sooner risk it on one pull of a slot machine than what this movie would net. 20. My guess is: whenever the director yelled ""Cut!"" or ""That's a Wrap!"" the actors, were seeing the connection to their future. 21. It's sad when, while laughing as hard as possible at a movie, you still think this would have worked perfectas a 15-second Family Guy cutaway. 22. SYFY Channel Productions is in the process of suing for deformation of character. 23. Wearing green does not equate going green. Heck, it's not even a believable subliminal message. 24. Not all blame can be put upon the director. These actors did appear to be conscious. 25. $5/gallon for gas this summer? Ha! Call me when it becomes $100/gallon. 26. In a post-apocalyptic world, credit cards work just fine. 27. A movie about mysterious/unexplained ""bird"" attacks needs some time to get to that. The first 50 minutes out of 90 should be just the right about of time to watch people drive, turn left, fill up their gas tank, dance to a cruise-ship reject singer, fall in love in conjunction with making fake love in a motel, make one company rich enough to sell while simultaneously building another from scratch and land a Victoria Secret gig. 28. MST3k wouldn't know where to begin. 29. If someone tries to steal your gas can, simply wait until they, without cause, begin walking backwards, from you and their own getaway car, so the ""birds"" can ""ironically"" take them out.30. Knocking off $1,000 off a $20,000 home solar panel is a steal. 31. Using two different Thai restaurant fronts in two simultaneous shots doesn't just equate a mistake; it makes you stupid. 32. ""And on with the traffic report: 'Well, traffic is running smoothly on Cabrillo Highway, but make sure you watch out for tons of cars on the shoulder that contains what looks like moving dead people. Nohehthey're not zombies, but even if they were, the couple with the toy guns should take care of them.'"" 33. Find yourself under attack from ""birds"" but that darned tourist bus just isn't holding up? Well, listen to a stranger and gather your thoughts in the fresh air, under the blue skyin plain view of the very birds you're trying to avoid. 34. If a ""bird scientist"" tells you to stand back, simply walk up to him and just ask him to talk. It will throw him so far off, he'll have no choice in attempting to fill some plot holes in your movie. Unsuccessfullybut still. 35. Dialogue should never be plagiarized from Bazooka Joe Comics. 36. Sound effects and boom mics should be used to enhance the feature, not cause further ridicule. 37. These ""birds"" seem more bent on revenge than Jaws did in his fourth installment. 38. Long before Birdemic was made and someone asked the director when it was supposed to be made, his response should've been: The Day After Tomorrowrepeatedly. 39.

1.0,The worst movie of the decade and probably the most preachy,"I just got done watching Birdemic for the first time, I knew it was made on 10,000 dollars and it is regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. This same day I also watched The Happening and The Crawling Eye (MST3K version) so maybe I was feeling masochistic. This movie was all around bad in every aspect. It looks like it was shot on a fairly cheap digital video camera and it's obvious that the sound was recorded from the microphone built into the camera instead of a boom mic. I know that because the sound is very awful, the actors have to be pretty close to the camera to be heard right, and there's way too much loud background noise which in post production they played a lot of public domain elevator music to drown out the background noise. The worst audio issue was when they film on the beach because the sounds of the beach are 5 times louder than the actors voices.The movie itself is very slow paced, the first half of the movie is just the main guy meeting his dream girl and building their relationship. The problem is that nobody in this movie can act and the writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters, not even vanilla more like tofu bland. We get no reason to care about these people in any way and to make them less likable the main guy has to talk about solar panels, hybrid cars, global warming, and even the war in Iraq as much as he can. The script is almost a love letter to Al Gore. This feels like an eternity where it goes from his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about, his obsession with a greener world, and his dates.The second half of the movie is when the birds finally go on a rampage. Lots of 2D computer generated birds that fly around in circles and attack their prey by hovering in place while moving their wings up and down and making the same noise looped over and over the whole movie. Somehow these berserk eagles can set house on fire as well as kill people in one swoop. The couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride in their van, this van has everything from handguns and two AK-47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo (I'm guessing the van has Game Genie,) as well as medical supplies, and anything the plot requires. Most of the movie has these people gunning down birds and searching for survivors. The survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isn't the eagles we should be afraid of, it's global warming and mankind's use of fossil fuels that is responsible for this disaster.As far as the action goes, it's about as lame as the trailer makes it look. When someone dies it's just a bird hovering in front of the person and they fall down with blood make up on them. There's also some really pointless scenes there just to raise the body count like a man who pulls a gun on them (even though they still have an assault riffle that they seem to forget about for the rest of the movie)who wants their gas, which they say cost them 100 dollars a gallon. There's a whole lot of nothing interesting going on. At least companies like Troma can take a 10 cent movie and throw in lots of nudity, over the top gore, and comedy. The people behind Birdemic have the worst CGI effects since the old Star Trek movies and long speeches about the environment. If you watch it, bring some friends and laugh at it because it works in that regard. Other than that it's Duck Hunt: The Movie.",worst movie decade probably most preachy,i just got done watching birdemic first time i knew it was made 10 000 dollars it is regarded as one worst movies all time this same day i also watched happening crawling eye mst3k version so maybe i was feeling masochistic this movie was all around bad every aspect it looks like it was shot fairly cheap digital video camera its obvious that sound was recorded microphone built into camera instead boom mic i know that because sound is very awful actors have be pretty close camera be heard right theres way too much loud background noise which post production they played lot public domain elevator music drown out background noise worst audio issue was when they film beach because sounds beach are 5 times louder than actors voices movie itself is very slow paced first half movie is just main guy meeting his dream girl building their relationship problem is that nobody this movie can act writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters not even vanilla more like tofu bland we get no reason care about these people any way make them less likable main guy has talk about solar panels hybrid cars global warming even war iraq as much as he can script is almost love letter al gore this feels like eternity where it goes his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about his obsession with greener world his dates second half movie is when birds finally go rampage lots 2d computer generated birds that fly around circles attack their prey by hovering place while moving their wings up down making same noise looped over over whole movie somehow these berserk eagles can set house fire as well as kill people one swoop couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride their van this van has everything handguns two ak 47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo im guessing van has game genie as well as medical supplies anything plot requires most movie has these people gunning down birds searching survivors survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isnt eagles we should be afraid its global warming mankinds use fossil fuels that is responsible this disaster as far as action goes its about as lame as trailer makes it look when someone dies its just bird hovering front person they fall down with blood make up them theres also some really pointless scenes there just raise body count like man who pulls gun them even though they still have assault riffle that they seem forget about rest movie who wants their gas which they say cost them 100 dollars gallon theres whole lot nothing interesting going at least companies like troma can take 10 cent movie throw lots nudity over top gore comedy people behind birdemic have worst cgi effects since old star trek movies long speeches about environment if you watch it bring some friends laugh at it because it works that regard other than that its duck hunt movie,0.4899597069597068,-0.048399267399267386,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1.0,"A joke, the worst film ever committed to celluloid","First of all, to approach ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" with any kind of hope of witnessing a good feature film is utter lunacy. ""Amateur"" is a word a thousand times too generous for this film's description. Even given its low budget of $10,000, the majority of which seems to have gone on car fuel, the film is a joke. The acting is unspeakably bad, the ""special"" effects aren't worth mentioning, the music is corny and inappropriate, and the film's editing techniques have all the marvel of a flip-book.The only way to enjoy this film is to treat it as exactly that, a joke. The above faults of the film are so glaring that the film becomes one huge joke that you can laugh along to. However, even this joke wears thin pretty quickly, and you're left feeling quite empty, as if you've been cheated out of 95 minutes of your life.Nonetheless, I am firmly convinced that it is the director James Nguyen who is having the last laugh, as he has created a film so notoriously bad that everyone wants to see it. Perhaps the joke is on us, and the director's intention was to see just how popular this film could be through its infamy. Even so, absolutely nothing can forgive how bad this film really is. It makes Battlefield Earth feel like Star Wars, and makes the special effects of 1933's King Kong look like those of Avatar. It is, quite simply, the worst film ever committed to celluloid.Watching the trailer, I actually had a decent laugh, and thought it might be worth it. But having watched the finished product, the knowledge that somebody spent $10,000 making this ugly piece of garbage and then having the audacity to call it a film is infuriating, and actually quite offensive.

1.0,I felt my brain melting and eyes aching,"When a movie starts with music that grinds your ears, standard movie- maker font, 10 minutes of random shots from the valleys of Hollywood and an unknown B-movie director that claims he's the ""master of romantic thrillers"", you know you're in for one hell of a ride. I don't really know if this movie is a joke or not, if they actually went in full force with the intention of actually making a great film with their 10.000 dollar budget, clearly they did not. When the actual film starts, the camera is so horrid I thought the cameraman was drunk, or if I was unwillingly intoxicated. Anyways, I had to check my earphones after a couple of minutes, because the sound suddenly stopped and popped up at random, looks like the sound-mixer of this movie probably is deaf or some sort of modern day Hellen Keller. Let's say something about the acting.. if there is any. I felt my heart wrenching when the protagonist started reading his lines, his act is already so wooden after two minutes of screen-time he'd fit right in the Ents from the ""Lord of the Rings""-trilogy. When an actor can't even walk straight without showing signs of having something rectangular shoved up his rectum, there's something wrong.After about 45 minutes of clapping (yes, see it for yourself), a love story that makes the Twilight-saga seem like ""The Notebook"" and ""Titanic"" combined, dialouges that are from another planet and all-in- all all I'm thinking: Is this movie the ""Shock and Terror"" the sub-title proclamates? 'Cause I haven't seen a f*cking bird yet!!When the birds arrive.. No, I don't even care to write about it.. I feel ashamed of myself. I feel like laying down in the shower with my clothes on and cry while the cold water is running on full.This movie basically makes Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" seem like the new ""Schindler's List"".

2.0,Schlock and Sputter,"Birdemic: Shock and Terror has made a splash in the underground community of masochists that enjoy atrocious cinema. With a tag line of ""Why did the eagles and vultures attacked?"" people have mistakenly believed this is the newest ""so bad its good"" title. As evidenced by the midnight screening I attended, these people are or will be very disappointed. The incompetence on display here is remarkable. Director James Nguyen has no idea of simply techniques like: writing a coherent story, including sound in every shot, knowing when to end shots, or incorporation of special effects. Nguyen is a Vietnamese immigrant and had no training of any kind in filmmaking. He was apparently inspired to create this film due to his affection for The Birds.The film opens with an extended driving sequence where the camera hovers at an odd angle for no reason. It is tilted slightly to the right for almost eight minutes before anything at all happens. It's almost a loving homage to the opening of Manos: The Hands of Fate, which was also directed by someone who had no idea of how to make movies. After this unbearable sequence, we are introduced to the main character, Rod. He works for a technology company and has apparently earned stock options. He notifies us of his success about every ten minutes and uses it as a way to pick up an attractive fashion model named Natalie. This was the first role for both actors and they are so artificial in their delivery, it's as if Nguyen told them to eliminate any emotion their characters should have experienced. Whitney Moore, who plays Natalie, appears to have a little bit of acting ability. She at least smiles sometimes.The first half of the movie contains no bird attacks. This is the ""romantic"" part of the movie, if you could call it such. Nguyen insists calling his movie a ""romantic thriller"" instead of a horror movie. For seemingly no reason at all, eagles and vultures interrupt the couple while they have sex without removing their clothes. These creatures are floating GIF images and hover over the screen. They are so poorly incorporated into the live action that they never actually give the presence of third dimensionality. They are stuck to the frame until the next scene begins. This is amusing for about five minutes and then becomes monotonous, not only because of the repetition of seeing the birds but also because a looping chirp plays whenever they are on screen. We later learn the birds are attacking because global warming has somehow affected them. I honestly cannot recall what the explanation was in detail because I had difficulty hearing it. Nguyen didn't use anything to amplify dialog, so you will strain to hear what characters are saying most of the time.Birdemic is an unusually bad, bad movie. It's a lack of imagination mixed with a lack of technical competence only made worse by a runtime of an hour and a half. If that wasn't enough to ensure its infamy, promotional material listed it as ""Bidemic"". It's actually worse than the TV sequel to Hitchcock's film that was later disowned by its director.Not Recommended",schlock sputter,birdemic shock terror has made splash underground community masochists that enjoy atrocious cinema with tag line why did eagles vultures attacked people have mistakenly believed this is newest so bad its good title as evidenced by midnight screening i attended these people are or will be very disappointed incompetence display here is remarkable director james nguyen has no idea simply techniques like writing coherent story including sound every shot knowing when end shots or incorporation special effects nguyen is vietnamese immigrant had no training any kind filmmaking he was apparently inspired create this film due his affection birds film opens with extended driving sequence where camera hovers at odd angle no reason it is tilted slightly right almost eight minutes before anything at all happens its almost loving homage opening manos hands fate which was also directed by someone who had no idea how make movies after this unbearable sequence we are introduced main character rod he works technology company has apparently earned stock options he notifies us his success about every ten minutes uses it as way pick up attractive fashion model named natalie this was first role both actors they are so artificial their delivery its as if nguyen told them eliminate any emotion their characters should have experienced whitney moore who plays natalie appears have little bit acting ability she at least smiles sometimes first half movie contains no bird attacks this is romantic part movie if you could call it such nguyen insists calling his movie romantic thriller instead horror movie seemingly no reason at all eagles vultures interrupt couple while they have sex without removing their clothes these creatures are floating gif images hover over screen they are so poorly incorporated into live action that they never actually give presence third dimensionality they are stuck frame until next scene begins this is amusing about five minutes then becomes monotonous not only because repetition seeing birds but also because looping chirp plays whenever they are screen we later learn birds are attacking because global warming has somehow affected them i honestly cannot recall what explanation was detail because i had difficulty hearing it nguyen didnt use anything amplify dialog so you will strain hear what characters are saying most time birdemic is unusually bad bad movie its lack imagination mixed with lack technical competence only made worse by runtime hour half if that wasnt enough ensure its infamy promotional material listed it as bidemic its actually worse than tv sequel hitchcocks film that was later disowned by its director not recommended,0.4805114638447974,0.046451619368286054,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,"This is what happen if 'The Birds' wasn't directed by Alfred Hitchcock, but a crazy fan of his","Failure –noun 1. an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success: 2. nonperformance of something due, required, or expected: 3. James Nguyen's ""Birdemic"". Birdemic is just plan awful. It's doesn't even belong in the 'it's so bad, it's good' group of bad movies. It's lacks any sense of entertainment. At first, I thought this was a student film, due to it's windows movie maker CGI effects, wooden acting, audio conflict and bad editing shots, but no, this movie was just produce by James Nguyen, the modern day Ed Wood with Tippi Hedren serving as his Bela Lugusi. He never received any formal training in movie-making, but instead grew up watching the movies of Alred Hitchcock, including his 1963 picture 'The birds'. It took the director four years to make this movie, and it's still awful. Please James Nguyen, learn how to make a movie, please. Birdemic: Shock and Terror starts with the shocking and terrifying Rod (Alan Bagh) who the camera loves to show driving and walking over loop music, badly made sound effects, or blank silence. Rod meets up with aspiring fashion model Nathalie (Whitney Moore) and begins dating her. The dialogue between the two wooden actors are just bad. It's like a hurricane blew through the script and devastated every line in it's path. The whole idea of the two main characters being a couple is just awkward as both have no connection with each other, it felt like the actress didn't really wanted to be there. The whole love story is just painfully to watch due to it's dullish. The first part of the movie is so boring with non needed scenes, bad fade in and fade outs, and long pauses when cuts are needed. Most of the audience is just waiting for the birds to attack and kill these folks just because the movie need some type of entertaining value. Rod and Nathalie woke up to find that their town Half Moon Bay is under attack from CGI photoshop eagles and vultures that spit acid, disappear in end of shots and explode into flames upon striking the ground. I'm not a naturalist like Charles Darwin, but I don't think birds explode or spit acid due to Global Warning effects. The movie love to mention Global Warning, but doesn't really do a good job on explaining it. They even had a badly written doctor on a bridge to try to explain it, and he wouldn't do the job. Even Al Gore would hate this movie. The whole plot is directless, and the movie tries to pay tribute to 'The Birds', but felt like a cheap knock off of that. The sound is horrible, there are scenes where the movie go silence, yet in others, such as the one at the beaches. The sound of the waves crashing, makes the movie hard to hear. Don't get me started on the annoying sound during the attack, and things rubbing against the microphone. Oh god the bird screams, my ears are bleeding. I wasn't even aware it was possible to fail this badly. It fails as a romance and it really fails as a horror flick. I try to look for any good notes for the film, and I can't find anything worth noting. That's how bad, I dislike this film. I can't believe that they are even thinking of making a 2nd movie: Birdemic 2: The Resurrection. Birdemic is just pure cinematic failure on absolutely every conceivable level. I'm surprised it wasn't written, produced, directed and starred in by Alan Smithee. This movie makes Troll 2 look like Orson Welles 'Citizen Kane' or Tommy Wiseau 'The Room' look like Godfather.

The lead actor is always talking about his lame job, the sound is choppy, the birds are incredibly fake looking, the actors are terrible, and they talk about global warming every 10 minutes. Rod is a software salesman who runs into a fashion model named Natalie. They show their melodramatic love story until finally the birdemic starts. (It takes 47 minutes for the birds to start attacking) When they attack, that's when the fun of this movie begins. When they shoot at the birds, it's like the old Nintendo game, Duck Hunt. Rod and Natalie meet up with survivors and help two kids who lost their parents, but don't seem to care enough. Will they survive? This movie is worth a watch.

1.0,"really awful, but strangely entertaining","Given that ""Birdemic"" has been blasted by many critics, I think I should say something positive about it to start off with. The scenery of Half Moon Bay is agreeable, for one thing, and Ms. Moore has at least a modicum of charisma; also, anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid Mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots. All positive aspects of this film.Less positive aspects of this film are legion, so much so that I'm reminded of my wish that IMDb.com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 (in which case ""Birdemic"" would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned, and perhaps a 4 for meaning well (though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and ham-handed manner)). Still, something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all ~ in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself. This film very much reminds me of a rough draft ~ a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal (thus making the upcoming larger-budget sequel all the more intriguing).Yet, I wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made. If it featured better sound, editing, writing, acting, direction and special effects, it might just be a forgettable homage to ""The Birds""; its very flaws elevate (or should I say depress?) it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like ""The Room"" and ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"" ~ the legendary realm of films that are so bad they're good. So, giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft, I tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the Bottom 100 (once it gathers the requisite number of votes).",really awful but strangely entertaining,given that birdemic has been blasted by many critics i think i should say something positive about it start off with scenery half moon bay is agreeable one thing ms moore has at least modicum charisma also anyone who appreciates stylish blue hybrid mustang rolling along stately manner gets savor that very sight many lingering shots all positive aspects this film less positive aspects this film are legion so much so that im reminded my wish that imdb com would allow vote scale 1 100 rather than 1 10 which case birdemic would rate at least 3 out 100 reasons mentioned perhaps 4 meaning well though message about global warming comes across preachy ham handed manner still something about profoundly amateurish quality this film makes it feel little unfair rate it at all much same way that it would feel wrong grade term paper basis some rough notes jotted down before writing paper rather than paper itself this film very much reminds me rough draft sort rough visualization what film would have been if producer had more resources at his disposal thus making upcoming larger budget sequel all more intriguing yet i wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made if it featured better sound editing writing acting direction special effects it might just be forgettable homage birds its very flaws elevate or should i say depress it special level otherwise occupied by few special films like room manos hands fate legendary realm films that are so bad theyre good so giving it benefit doubt as real film not just rough draft i tender my vote 1 out 10 hope that other fans this film will also give it appropriately low vote insure its rightful place bottom 100 once it gathers requisite number votes,0.453837273837274,0.05920239482739483,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,Shock and Terror is completely right.,"Last night, I went to a local movie rental store with my grandparents to rent some movies to watch. We rented two movies. First, we rented Saving Mr. Banks. It's a fantastic movie, I suggest you watch it. Second, we rented this. This was more for my pleasure because I knew neither of them would like it. So, this morning, I sat down and saw it. Oh boy This movie stars a guy named Rod. He's your average marketer until he meets the girl of his dreams. They go out for a little bit, and then all of a sudden, a huge swarm of birds attacks the city! And that is literally the entire plot. The story is just so random. It's almost like a really crappy sitcom for a while then BIRDS! HOLY CRAP BIRDS! What I love most about the ""plot"" of this movie is that the first forty minutes or so is completely worthless. This movie is about birds attacking the series, so why is there so much relationship and work drama? Plus, there are scenes that don't make sense. For example, at one point in the movie, a guy goes to the main character's house about making a deal to install a solar panel to the house. What does that have to do with the plot? Absolutely nothing. Nothing new was added to the plot, none of this is ever mentioned again, so why? What's the point? The cinematography is absolute crap. The camera never steadies and focuses on the right thing. Every shot looks like it belongs in a home movie. There are some shots that feel completely random and just out of place. It just looks awful. The editing is even worse. The scene transitions are beyond choppy with so many, many jump cuts. There are literally four jump cuts in the same exact scene at one point. Plus, this movie has that audio static you get when recording with a low budget camera, only in this movie between every scene the level of static changes. And sometimes it goes away altogether. Hey Nguyen- I don't know if you've ever heard of this before. It's called a boom-mike? It's really neat! It makes all the sound sound much crisper without all that audio static. But I see you wasted your entire 10 dollar budget on CGI, so what's the point of telling you this? Speaking of CGI ugh the CGI is poop! It's the kind of bad that you can't describe just because of the sheer amount of awful it withholds. It's just bad. All the CGI is put into birds, explosions, and blood effects. Do you think you could've tried a little harder? The birds are absolutely ridiculous. Not only are they animated like crap, but they just make no sense. These birds literally dive-bomb towards the city, kamikaze style, and explode on impact. Also, they have no actual entrance or exit in the movie. After forty minutes of the bullcrap that is the story, the birds just appear and start attacking everybody. No explanation why, they just do. And at the end, they just fly away like it's nothing. There's no reason why they should. There's no indication of anything that happens that would drive the birds away. This plot hole makes the movie all the more pointless. Now I have to touch on the acting. The acting rendered me speechless. Wooden does not begin to describe the acting. Everyone seems like they're phoning it in, and even that is being too generous. Everyone does an absolutely awful job. Especially the main character. He brings a whole new level of awful to the table. I've seen better acting from the people that are in the home videos on AFV. And they aren't even acting! I just I I can't! I can't do this! Overall, Birdemic Shock and Terror is horrendous. The acting sucks, the CGI sucks, the story (or what little there is, anyway) sucks, there are scenes that make no sense, the cinematography looks like it was done by a toddler, the audio is grating, the characters are annoying, everything just sucks! And do you know what the cherry on top is? THIS MOVIE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE. I'm serious. The characters in the movie say that ""global warming"" is the cause of all this. Bullcrap! What a cop-out! In terms of quality, this movie is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I still like it better than Battlefield Earth, though. Score: 1.0/10",shock terror is completely right,last night i went local movie rental store with my grandparents rent some movies watch we rented two movies first we rented saving mr banks its fantastic movie i suggest you watch it second we rented this this was more my pleasure because i knew neither them would like it so this morning i sat down saw it oh boy this movie stars guy named rod hes your average marketer until he meets girl his dreams they go out little bit then all sudden huge swarm birds attacks city that is literally entire plot story is just so random its almost like really crappy sitcom while then birds holy crap birds what i love most about plot this movie is that first forty minutes or so is completely worthless this movie is about birds attacking series so why is there so much relationship work drama plus there are scenes that dont make sense example at one point movie guy goes main characters house about making deal install solar panel house what does that have do with plot absolutely nothing nothing new was added plot none this is ever mentioned again so why whats point cinematography is absolute crap camera never steadies focuses right thing every shot looks like it belongs home movie there are some shots that feel completely random just out place it just looks awful editing is even worse scene transitions are beyond choppy with so many many jump cuts there are literally four jump cuts same exact scene at one point plus this movie has that audio static you get when recording with low budget camera only this movie between every scene level static changes sometimes it goes away altogether hey nguyen i dont know if youve ever heard this before its called boom mike its really neat it makes all sound sound much crisper without all that audio static but i see you wasted your entire 10 dollar budget cgi so whats point telling you this speaking cgi ugh cgi is poop its kind bad that you cant describe just because sheer amount awful it withholds its just bad all cgi is put into birds explosions blood effects do you think you couldve tried little harder birds are absolutely ridiculous not only are they animated like crap but they just make no sense these birds literally dive bomb towards city kamikaze style explode impact also they have no actual entrance or exit movie after forty minutes bullcrap that is story birds just appear start attacking everybody no explanation why they just do at end they just fly away like its nothing theres no reason why they should theres no indication anything that happens that would drive birds away this plot hole makes movie all more pointless now i have touch acting acting rendered me speechless wooden does not begin describe acting everyone seems like theyre phoning it even that is being too generous everyone does absolutely awful job especially main character he brings whole new level awful table ive seen better acting people that are home videos afv they arent even acting i just i i cant i cant do this overall birdemic shock terror is horrendous acting sucks cgi sucks story or what little there is anyway sucks there are scenes that make no sense cinematography looks like it was done by toddler audio is grating characters are annoying everything just sucks do you know what cherry top is this movie is environmental message im serious characters movie say that global warming is cause all this bullcrap what cop out terms quality this movie is definitely worst movie ive ever seen i still like it better than battlefield earth though score 1 0 10,0.4891499023851962,-0.032830192683133856,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"
1.0,Can this even be considered a movie?!,"It's hard to imagine that ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" isn't at the top of IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 List. After all, it's about the most amateurish and stupid film I've ever seen. Most kids posting homemade videos on YouTube make more professional looking stuff than this terrible mess. Imagine the joy in watching ""Birdemic"" as you see folks act who have LESS talent than middle school students in a school play! Imagine the use of a home movie camera whose sound is only activated when the 'actors' talk--and cuts on and off loudly and abruptly as they talk! Much of it is like a silent movie!! Imagine weirdly askew camera angles, scenes where lines are flubbed and a glacial pace. Yup, all that awaits you if you bother to watch this film! Oh, and lest I forget...there really is NO PLOT through much of the movie!! Yes, despite supposedly being about killer birds, nothing really happens during almost all the film! It's more like they turned on the camera and simply put EVERYTHING in the movie--even when it was completely irrelevant and you could care less about the characters!! So eventually it's saved when the birds FINALLY attack, right?! WRONG!!! The 'birds' are even more lame than stuffed birds on sticks or guys making shadow puppets of birds! You really have to see and hear them to believe 'em! When I say this is a horrible film, I mean that it is monumentally horrible. I am talking WORSE than ""Plan 9"", ""Rat Fink a Boo Boo"" and, believe it or not, worse than ""The Room""!! Now that's bad!! Now considering that I am a fan of bad films and have reviewed well over 12,000 movies, when I say that this is the WORST film I have ever seen (yes, even worse than ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"") it means something!! Abysmal in every way...so bad you wonder if it was all some joke and never was intended as anything more!

2.0,really really bad,Rod runs into former classmate model Nathalie. Global warming and blah blah. Birds attack.Horrible acting. Horrible writing. Badly stilted dialogue. Ill-fitting music. Horrible directions. Long boring non-scenes. Bad special effects. It's hilarious for about two minutes as it smacks your face all at once. Then it's intermittently funny as new levels of awfulness occurs. This is an incredibly bad movie. It's a student film at best. The bad sound design gets annoying. The squawking mixed with planes on bombing runs is as terrible as it gets. I'm comfortable giving this movie one star. The laughs are not generated deliberately. I'm laughing at how bad this is.

1.0,How did no one prevent this abomination from coming into being?,"A lot of things have been said about this movie, I read most of the reviews, but nothing could prepare me for the clogged toilet full of sh*t that is birdemic. Don't get me wrong I think you should see it, but it is truly the worst movie EVER.Okay the CGI is HORRIBLE, the sound transitions between scenes are so bad you will think somebody switched the channel and none of the actors have any real talent. The plot is more made up of mistakes than an actual story, all characters are one dimensional and boring at best. The best part of the movie is the worst part of a porn movie, seeing the chick in her underwear.Why I still think you should watch this is because of the leading role, Rod (or whatever), played by Alan Bagh. I think a cardboard cutout of the ""They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! Oh my GOOOOOOOOD!""-guy from troll 2 (search it on youtube if you haven't seen it) would do a better job than this guy. He can not do a single movement naturally, seriously everything he does looks ridiculous. EVERYTHING. He can't walk, talk, get into a car or even stand still like a normal person.The first half hour of the movie (no birds yet) is hilarious because of him stumbling around like someone who is recovering from a severe stroke and had most of his brain removed. Moore tries to save it and she's actually not half bad (okay she's pretty bad but so much better than Bagh) but it just doesn't work because she has to act like she likes him. HE IS THE MOST BORING ZERO-DIMENSIONAL C*CKSUCKER EVER WHY WOULD ANYONE GIVE A SH*T ABOUT HIS HOBBIES OR HIS STUPID JOB.The plot is total garbage of course, but what bothers me most is the TOTAL LACK OF SENSE on Nguyens part. At one point they find a dead bird on the beach, but instead of getting a dead chicken somewhere they use a CGI bird. IT LOOKS TERRIBLE. WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH A THING.This movie makes 2012: Ice Age look like Avatar. In comparison to this, Mega Shark Vs. Giant Octopus is worthy of 10 Oscars. It is unbelievable that anyone would produce this, did no one with a milligram of sense and taste watch this before it was brought out? Nguyen and everyone he knows should be whipped severely for making this hell spawn of a movie.Bottom line: Go watch it and be amazed at the unbelievable amounts of incompetence one can show in just 90 minutes.

1.0,Bad as bad is bad,"Every now and again, I read a review on this site of a film where the person says things like, ""it's the worst movie I've ever seen!"", when it might indeed be pretty ordinary, but not really one star basis. My thought is usually, ""You really don't know what 'bad' is, do you?"" ""Birdemic: Shock And Terror"" is bad. It is as bad as what people say it is. It is almost unbelievably bad, and I can believe a lot. It is gobsmackingly awful - this coming from a fan of Ed Wood.Rod and Nathalie are two former schoolmates who happen to come across each other, and proceed to fall in love, also happening to find out that they just happen to have neutral fans who also just happen to be in love.Nothing occurs in the first half of the film. Nothing. After the opening credits, where a tinny tune is played on a continuous loop, we are treated to deadening acting (although, in defense, Whitney Moore isn't too bad), atrocious dialogue, horrible sound and dreadful editing. This all makes it vastly entertaining, for those who are fascinated by such ineptness.After this first half of routine and dreadful drama, the birds start attacking. Just like that. There are a couple of references to strange things happening in nature earlier but, really, it could have all just been a 'straight' (so to speak) love story beforehand.It could be that filmmaker James Nguyen, a self-proclaimed Hitchcock fan, tried to take a leaf out of the Master's book here, where Hitch sometimes had his thrillers trundle along in an unalarming way for a while until, almost casually, things would start to happen and, before we knew it, the thrills were on.The difference is, of course, that Hitchcock did it with style, wit and panache.To say the birds attack is a very loose statement. In reality, they are superimposed on the screen, bouncing up and down, while the actors wave various articles at them. When one thinks about it, this is not really very surprising. If a scene of two people talking in a restaurant can't be handled above the level of complete incompetence, how could we expect more from the special effects later? As we go on, our heroes fire guns, with unlimited ammunition, at the birds, while driving around aimlessly, trying to help others, including picking up two children.These children have just seen their mother killed by the birds. And yet, before long, they're sitting in the back seat of the car playing computer games, and demanding Happy Meals! Other people get killed by birds suddenly flying past them, and seeming to clip them with their beaks or claws, which is enough to drop them on the spot.And the ending. The ending... It's utter meaninglessness suits the film perfectly. As someone who is fascinated by true badness (not just in movies), ""Birdemic"" transcends such things for me. Everything that could possibly be wrong in filmmaking (again, with the possible exception of Moore) is on display here. Everything. Maybe one day, Tim Burton will do a sequel to ""Ed Wood"" and call it ""James Nguyen"", although it would be harder to pronounce. But surely it would be worth the admission price.",bad as bad is bad,every now again i read review this site film where person says things like its worst movie ive ever seen when it might indeed be pretty ordinary but not really one star basis my thought is usually you really dont know what bad is do you birdemic shock terror is bad it is as bad as what people say it is it is almost unbelievably bad i can believe lot it is gobsmackingly awful this coming fan ed wood rod nathalie are two former schoolmates who happen come across each other proceed fall love also happening find out that they just happen have neutral fans who also just happen be love nothing occurs first half film nothing after opening credits where tinny tune is played continuous loop we are treated deadening acting although defense whitney moore isnt too bad atrocious dialogue horrible sound dreadful editing this all makes it vastly entertaining those who are fascinated by such ineptness after this first half routine dreadful drama birds start attacking just like that there are couple references strange things happening nature earlier but really it could have all just been straight so speak love story beforehand it could be that filmmaker james nguyen self proclaimed hitchcock fan tried take leaf out masters book here where hitch sometimes had his thrillers trundle along unalarming way while until almost casually things would start happen before we knew it thrills were difference is course that hitchcock did it with style wit panache say birds attack is very loose statement reality they are superimposed screen bouncing up down while actors wave various articles at them when one thinks about it this is not really very surprising if scene two people talking restaurant cant be handled above level complete incompetence how could we expect more special effects later as we go our heroes fire guns with unlimited ammunition at birds while driving around aimlessly trying help others including picking up two children these children have just seen their mother killed by birds yet before long theyre sitting back seat car playing computer games demanding happy meals other people get killed by birds suddenly flying past them seeming clip them with their beaks or claws which is enough drop them spot ending ending its utter meaninglessness suits film perfectly as someone who is fascinated by true badness not just movies birdemic transcends such things me everything that could possibly be wrong filmmaking again with possible exception moore is display here everything maybe one day tim burton will do sequel ed wood call it james nguyen although it would be harder pronounce but surely it would be worth admission price,0.5076800976800975,-0.11825763125763127,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1.0,Where Do I Start?,"I don't know where to begin, so I'll say this. I've heard The Room reviewed as the ""Citizen Kane"" of bad movies. After watching Birdemic: Shock and Terror, The Room will actually seem as good as Citizen Kane.Birdemic: Shock and Terror is a cult film waiting to happen. The low budget, the amateur cast and crew, the goofy, hole-ridden plot, but what this movie has that classic cult films like The Room and Troll 2 for example don't, is a complete ineptitude from the standpoint of all involved in this movie. I could watch Troll 2 and The Room, and I could picture in some alternate dimension that everything that was wrong with those movies was tweaked and they actually weren't half bad, but Birdemic: Shock and Terror is different.First of all, the editing in this movie is worse than your average high schooler's film studies project. Almost every perspective change in a scene is accompanied with a long, awkward pause and an obvious change in sound, even on the television. I'm pretty sure the director/producer/writer of this atrocity (James Nguyen) just used the built-in mic on his digital camcorder. Also, every scene is shot with a pan to the right. Believe it or not though, if there's one thing I'll give credit to in this film, is the music. It's actually decent, considering the small budget. The song played during the (awful) bar scene comes to mind because it's really catchy and actually has some really good musicianship. However, the film score is often repeated, and in the case of the beginning credits, is obnoxiously repeated.Next, the plot and writing. If you haven't seen the movie, the plot is that an aspiring software salesman meets a girl and they hit it off, only to have their wonderful love be cut short by killer birds. The plot is somewhat coherent, as it's pretty easy to figure out what's going on with the love story, and it's also pretty clear ""why did the eagles and vultures attacked"" (quoting a movie flier made by Nguyen himself). Thankfully, there aren't any subplots in the movie, unless you count the career ventures the characters make pretty early in the movie, which brings me to the writing.In the pile of steaming crap that is this movie, this has to be the smelliest part. Nguyen was inspired by two movies supposedly: Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth."" I read about that before I watched the movie, and I had a hard time thinking how those two could be combined, then I watched this film. The most out of place, out of context plugs for unrealistic ""green"" technology (absurdly cheap solar panels, 100 mpg Ford Mustang) can are uttered in this movie to the point where it's almost offensive. This is a part of the movie that you need to see to believe because I'd easily be over the word limit if I had to describe all these scenes.Finally, we'll talk about the acting. There's not much to say here, except that they aren't good actors. Thankfully, we don't see awkward characters or overacting like in other bad films that have acquired cult rating, but we do see bad actors nonetheless. I honestly don't feel like I can make a true judgement of their acting because of the terrible script and editing, but I can only imagine what I'd think if I got a ""true"" performance from them. If I had to pick the top 3 actors in this film, I'd pick the ""tree-hugger,"" Nathalie, and the nightclub singer.Basically, I suggest you watch this movie. This is probably the worst feature-length film of all time, and I've seen some bad films.",where do i start,i dont know where begin so ill say this ive heard room reviewed as citizen kane bad movies after watching birdemic shock terror room will actually seem as good as citizen kane birdemic shock terror is cult film waiting happen low budget amateur cast crew goofy hole ridden plot but what this movie has that classic cult films like room troll 2 example dont is complete ineptitude standpoint all involved this movie i could watch troll 2 room i could picture some alternate dimension that everything that was wrong with those movies was tweaked they actually werent half bad but birdemic shock terror is different first all editing this movie is worse than your average high schoolers film studies project almost every perspective change scene is accompanied with long awkward pause obvious change sound even television im pretty sure director producer writer this atrocity james nguyen just used built mic his digital camcorder also every scene is shot with pan right believe it or not though if theres one thing ill give credit this film is music its actually decent considering small budget song played during awful bar scene comes mind because its really catchy actually has some really good musicianship however film score is often repeated case beginning credits is obnoxiously repeated next plot writing if you havent seen movie plot is that aspiring software salesman meets girl they hit it off only have their wonderful love be cut short by killer birds plot is somewhat coherent as its pretty easy figure out whats going with love story its also pretty clear why did eagles vultures attacked quoting movie flier made by nguyen himself thankfully there arent any subplots movie unless you count career ventures characters make pretty early movie which brings me writing pile steaming crap that is this movie this has be smelliest part nguyen was inspired by two movies supposedly hitchcocks birds al gores inconvenient truth i read about that before i watched movie i had hard time thinking how those two could be combined then i watched this film most out place out context plugs unrealistic green technology absurdly cheap solar panels 100 mpg ford mustang can are uttered this movie point where its almost offensive this is part movie that you need see believe because id easily be over word limit if i had describe all these scenes finally well talk about acting theres not much say here except that they arent good actors thankfully we dont see awkward characters or overacting like other bad films that have acquired cult rating but we do see bad actors nonetheless i honestly dont feel like i can make true judgement their acting because terrible script editing but i can only imagine what id think if i got true performance them if i had pick top 3 actors this film id pick tree hugger nathalie nightclub singer basically i suggest you watch this movie this is probably worst feature length film all time ive seen some bad films,0.5937213403880071,-0.01371693121693121,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"
1.0,Just wow...,"Written, directed, and produced by James Nguyen, this is a tale of romance and, well, software development as birds descend on humanity. He'd also direct the films Julie and Jack, Replica and Birdemic 2: The Resurrection. There were plans to make the third film in the series, Birdemic 3: Sea Eagle, but it only raised one percent of its goal on Indiegogo and Kickstarter.This film cost $10,000. Before you see it, you may wonder how that was possible. After you watch it, you'll wonder where the money went.Rod, a Silicon Valley software salesman, and Nathalie, an aspiring fashion model, are living a charmed life. His bonus allows him to start his own business, she's become a Victoria's Secret model and they both are in love with each other. However, the signs of the end of the world are all around them, with unexplained wildfires and dead birds washing up on beaches.After a night of passion, Rod and Nathalie wake up to find that their town is under attack from acid-spitting and constantly exploding eagles and vultures. Joining up with an ex-Marine named Ramsey, his girlfriend Becky and two orphans named Susan and Tony, they go from town to town battling birds.Finally, Rod and Nathalie make their way to a small beach, where our hero battles the birds one more time until doves show up to drive them off. It turns out that the birds want to have peace and decide to give humanity a second chance to fix the environment.It'd help if the birds weren't all the same bird, just endlessly and lifelessly rotating in space, oblivious to reality. Then again, no moment of this film feels rooted in the world that we live in.During filming, Nguyen instructed Whitney Moore (Nathalie) not to socialize with her costar Alan Bagh (Rod) after filming. He also shot without permits and the crew was often kicked out of locations while in the middle of scenes. Nguyen would often flip out at people while filming, which led to Moore telling him not to yell and him refusing to talk to her or direct her for three weeks.To promote the finished movie, Nguyen took the movie to Sundance, handing out flyers from a van that was covered with stuffed birds and a paper sign that read BIDEMIC(yes, he spelled the name of his own movie incorrectly) and WHY DID THE EAGLES AND VULTURES ATTACKED before premiering the movie at a bar. This caught the eye of Severin Films, who distributed the film. You can grab a copy at their site, while you're at it.Tippi Hedren - from the original version of The Birds - appears in the film, but only on a TV via footage from Nguyen's Julie and Jack.This is an absolutely ridiculous film and as such, I love it. It's pretty amazing that one man's vision - of birds attacking the world as inspired by Hitchcock and Al Gore - went this far.",just wow,written directed produced by james nguyen this is tale romance well software development as birds descend humanity hed also direct films julie jack replica birdemic 2 resurrection there were plans make third film series birdemic 3 sea eagle but it only raised one percent its goal indiegogo kickstarter this film cost 10 000 before you see it you may wonder how that was possible after you watch it youll wonder where money went rod silicon valley software salesman nathalie aspiring fashion model are living charmed life his bonus allows him start his own business shes become victorias secret model they both are love with each other however signs end world are all around them with unexplained wildfires dead birds washing up beaches after night passion rod nathalie wake up find that their town is under attack acid spitting constantly exploding eagles vultures joining up with ex marine named ramsey his girlfriend becky two orphans named susan tony they go town town battling birds finally rod nathalie make their way small beach where our hero battles birds one more time until doves show up drive them off it turns out that birds want have peace decide give humanity second chance fix environment itd help if birds werent all same bird just endlessly lifelessly rotating space oblivious reality then again no moment this film feels rooted world that we live during filming nguyen instructed whitney moore nathalie not socialize with her costar alan bagh rod after filming he also shot without permits crew was often kicked out locations while middle scenes nguyen would often flip out at people while filming which led moore telling him not yell him refusing talk her or direct her three weeks promote finished movie nguyen took movie sundance handing out flyers van that was covered with stuffed birds paper sign that read bidemic yes he spelled name his own movie incorrectly why did eagles vultures attacked before premiering movie at bar this caught eye severin films who distributed film you can grab copy at their site while youre at it tippi hedren original version birds appears film but only tv via footage nguyens julie jack this is absolutely ridiculous film as such i love it its pretty amazing that one mans vision birds attacking world as inspired by hitchcock al gore went this far,0.6077777777777779,0.09926767676767678,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
2.0,Oh my,"Almost impossible review as a commercial movies, ""Birdemic"" looks like a home-made project that somehow got a release. Everything about it screams UNPROFESSIONAL!!! From the very basic opening credits, which are in a hideous PC-average font, to the very long and static shots that start too early (before the actors are ready) and go on too long (after the action or conversations have ended), which show no understanding of cutting or editing. From the terrible muffled sound which varies with every camera angle, revealing that there microphone was on the camera and sometimes the background noise drowns out the dialogue, to the script and acting which makes you want to throw things (the lead guy walks like a drugged 5 year old, which is a shame as there are many long minutes of footage devoted to showing him just walking).And then we have to bird effects which look like a screen saver or a phone app. Stuck just on top of the filmed action we see looped animations of birds which can seemingly hover in one place flapping in slow motion.The appalling plot sees our heroes spend 45 minutes doing normal everyday things like dating, meeting the parents, visiting restaurants and driving cars before anything happens. Once the bird attacks start, our gang of 4-6 ""survivors"" (apart from all the people strolling about that are not part of the film, and the endless traffic of other cars and trucks that are also not part of the film) seem to make a mad dash from the city (why is not explained) into the countryside (why that's safer is not explained), stopping regularly to buy gigantic bottles of water, armfuls of food and tanks full of petrol, only to somehow have to drink from streams and eat seaweed and a fish caught from the ocean only minutes later, when they can't be more than a few minutes stroll from another convenience store.You need nerves of steel to be able to sit through this and call it entertainment. I can only assume this is a home movie. If it is, it must have been fun for the actors and their friends to watch once it was finished, but how actually got to be distributed and sold commercially is a total mystery.",oh my,almost impossible review as commercial movies birdemic looks like home made project that somehow got release everything about it screams unprofessional very basic opening credits which are hideous pc average font very long static shots that start too early before actors are ready go too long after action or conversations have ended which show no understanding cutting or editing terrible muffled sound which varies with every camera angle revealing that there microphone was camera sometimes background noise drowns out dialogue script acting which makes you want throw things lead guy walks like drugged 5 year old which is shame as there are many long minutes footage devoted showing him just walking then we have bird effects which look like screen saver or phone app stuck just top filmed action we see looped animations birds which can seemingly hover one place flapping slow motion appalling plot sees our heroes spend 45 minutes doing normal everyday things like dating meeting parents visiting restaurants driving cars before anything happens once bird attacks start our gang 4 6 survivors apart all people strolling about that are not part film endless traffic other cars trucks that are also not part film seem make mad dash city why is not explained into countryside why thats safer is not explained stopping regularly buy gigantic bottles water armfuls food tanks full petrol only somehow have drink streams eat seaweed fish caught ocean only minutes later when they cant be more than few minutes stroll another convenience store you need nerves steel be able sit through this call it entertainment i can only assume this is home movie if it is it must have been fun actors their friends watch once it was finished but how actually got be distributed sold commercially is total mystery,0.49630060728744957,-0.005438596491228069,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,i am a bird,"Words cannot describe how greatly this movie changed my life. The year was 2014. My legs were gone. My children, somewhere in Ukraine. My wife stolen from me by the Government. Everything was going wrong for me. One day, I decide to rent Birdemic: Shock and Terror. The moment the movie started, my spirits lifted. Its four minute intro of only driving made me forget about my wife and children almost immediately. Then, the first words were spoken: ""h i"" I'd like to pay whoever casted this because they did an amazing job. The audio quality is also the best I've ever seen. Yes, this movie has gifted me the ability to see sound. Continuing, every word that was spoken inspired me as a person. I also learned, in detail, how to use a gun, which, I now find very helpful. Immediately after the movie ended, I heard a knock at my door. My legs had returned to me, kicking the door down and attaching themselves to my waist. With this first amazing thing happening to me, I had the motivation to fix everything.I flew to the White House, killing the president immediately with my bird-like stare. I grabbed my wife from the clutches of his arms and lifted her into the air with my newly grown wings, holding her with my feet. The children were next.We soon arrived in Ukraine, my children screaming when they saw me. There were tears in their eyes and they were backing away from shock. They missed me so dearly. I grabbed both and put them in my pelican-like beak, and began flying home. Birdemic: Shock and Terror is the reason I am still alive.",i am bird,words cannot describe how greatly this movie changed my life year was 2014 my legs were gone my children somewhere ukraine my wife stolen me by government everything was going wrong me one day i decide rent birdemic shock terror moment movie started my spirits lifted its four minute intro only driving made me forget about my wife children almost immediately then first words were spoken h i id like pay whoever casted this because they did amazing job audio quality is also best ive ever seen yes this movie has gifted me ability see sound continuing every word that was spoken inspired me as person i also learned detail how use gun which i now find very helpful immediately after movie ended i heard knock at my door my legs had returned me kicking door down attaching themselves my waist with this first amazing thing happening me i had motivation fix everything i flew white house killing president immediately with my bird like stare i grabbed my wife clutches his arms lifted her into air with my newly grown wings holding her with my feet children were next we soon arrived ukraine my children screaming when they saw me there were tears their eyes they were backing away shock they missed me so dearly i grabbed both put them my pelican like beak began flying home birdemic shock terror is reason i am still alive,0.5162563131313131,0.26130050505050506,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
4.0,Most amazing piece of garbage I've ever had the pleasure of seeing,"Shocking and terrorizing is right. I don't even know where to begin. All I can say is it has the worst editing, worst sound, worst acting, worst directing, worst special effects, worst story, and worst ending ever told. However it is by far the most breathtaking failure I've ever seen. It's like watching a work of art by Picasso created with dog poop and vomit under sewage water. Maybe that's what makes it fun to watch because of its honesty in trying to make a horror film with very limited resources. The pacing is atrocious though in that you will finally see the birds attack about 45 minutes through the movie and the birds look like Windows 95 screen savers. The sound editing...it's like every shot you will hear the difference in the background noise and by the time you see them ""firing"" guns your ears will explode due to the intensity of the sound. Forget about the plot because it doesn't even need one. All in all I can say it's a great movie to laugh at even when you are not drunk.",most amazing piece garbage ive ever had pleasure seeing,shocking terrorizing is right i dont even know where begin all i can say is it has worst editing worst sound worst acting worst directing worst special effects worst story worst ending ever told however it is by far most breathtaking failure ive ever seen its like watching work art by picasso created with dog poop vomit under sewage water maybe thats what makes it fun watch because its honesty trying make horror film with very limited resources pacing is atrocious though that you will finally see birds attack about 45 minutes through movie birds look like windows 95 screen savers sound editing its like every shot you will hear difference background noise by time you see them firing guns your ears will explode due intensity sound forget about plot because it doesnt even need one all all i can say its great movie laugh at even when you are not drunk,0.6827806122448978,-0.1086309523809524,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.19}"

2.0,"Stinks on ice (and reminds me of ""yellow snow"")","This seeming tribute to Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" is a classic example of what happens when someone with a lot of enthusiasm, but absolutely no talent or film craft (or money) tries to make a movie. It's bad in a way even Ed Wood or Jerry Warren are not; Wood because his love of his dreck somehow shines through in every frame he shoots; and Warren because Warren at least includes lots of stock footage from other, competent films in his concoctions. ""Birdemic"" evinces neither passion or competence - it just borks along long like a piece of outsider art made by someone who saw a movie once and took notes, but then lost the notes and just winged it. (Hah! See what I did there?That lame pun is STILL better than any of the writing or dialog you'll find in ""Birdemic"".) It's worth watching once just to laugh at the ludicrous special effects and the amateur hour acting. I have seen dozens of low budget science fiction and horror films in the last 40 years, and I have never seen worse examples of either. Seriously, the bird effects look like the product of a talented seventh grader, and I can't believe anyone over the age of six could convince themselves that what appeared on the screen was acceptable. The director would have been better off grabbing stock footage of bird attacks from nature documentaries and alternating them with footage of the actors (and I use the term advisedly) reacting to them, like the old Tarzan and Jungle Jim movies. And he would have been better off raiding the local high school and community college drama departments for his cast. Nothing against the actual cast members, who were probably just regular folks trying something different, but Lord, they're awful. Reasonably photogenic, (especially the heroine),but awful.The one good thing about Birdemic is that it tries to be about something, and it means well. It's dumb and clueless, but it isn't sleazy or creepy, and it doesn't seem to have been made in the spirit of an exploitation movie.
