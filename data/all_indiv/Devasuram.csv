10,"What a beautiful Film... Only the name ""Mangalaserry Neelakandan"" is enough","Devasuram is one of the most successful Malayalam movies and was directed by I. V. Sasi starring Mohanlal. The movies has a cult following and the characters in the movies are fondly remembered by the Malayalees. The rivalry between Mangalasherry Neelakantan (Mohanlal) and Mundakkal Shekaran (Napolean) is the main theme of the movie.Only the name ""Mangalaserry Neelakandan"" is enough. Beautiful Movie. Nice Direction. Devasuram adds feather to the Mohanlal acting. Acted by Mohanlal as ""Mangalachery Neelakandan"". Just the name says the power of the character. Character selection in this movie is excellent. Napeolean as ""Sekharan"" is another highlight of the movie. Then the character of Innocent. Wah... Then Revathi, Nedumudi venu and all main characters done their work extraordinary beautiful. Climax Scene is one of the highlight of the movie. Music by M.G Radhakrishan is excellent. Esp the song ""Vande mukunda hare"" sung by himself is amazing. Another main character is Oduvil unnikrishnan(peringodan). Nice Screenplay by renjith.

9,Wonder why such Malayalam movies aren't made anymore...,"This is easily one of the best Malayalam movies made. And one of the most iconic. The character of Mangalassery Neelakantan is as legendary a cult figure as it gets. The script was great, and so was the dialogue, both by Ranjith. No crass monologues as there would so often be a decade later. An example of the splendid dialogue (one example among many good ones) would be when Neelakantan talks about all the girls he'd romanced before as corpses, commending Bhanumati's character and calling her a real woman. Rarely in Indian cinema do we get a strong female lead (played so well by Revathi) going toe- to-toe with the male lead. But the heart and soul of the movie was Mohanlal. Without him, there would be no Devasuram. The ease and spontaneity with which he essays that role is commendable. Such a role is easy to ruin with one- dimensional histrionics, but Mohanlal does not do so. Also, he always has that quality to bring a dash of vulnerability to even the most invincible of the characters he plays.Even though this is one of my favourite movies I cannot give it a perfect 10 (I am tempted to do so). As great as it is, it could have potentially been even greater a movie, if it was handled with some more subtlety, like Irinjal rightly said. For example, the fight scenes were relevant to the plot, but a bit out of line with the realistic tone of the film, even with Mohanlal's larger-than-life character. The antagonist Shekharan could have been so much better than a bland, grimacing Napoleon. Imagine someone versatile like Siddique as Mundakkal Shekharan (sadly his versatility was exploited much later).",wonder why such malayalam movies arent made anymore,this is easily one best malayalam movies made one most iconic character mangalassery neelakantan is as legendary cult figure as it gets script was great so was dialogue both by ranjith no crass monologues as there would so often be decade later example splendid dialogue one example among many good ones would be when neelakantan talks about all girls hed romanced before as corpses commending bhanumatis character calling her real woman rarely indian cinema do we get strong female lead played so well by revathi going toe toe with male lead but heart soul movie was mohanlal without him there would be no devasuram ease spontaneity with which he essays that role is commendable such role is easy ruin with one dimensional histrionics but mohanlal does not do so also he always has that quality bring dash vulnerability even most invincible characters he plays even though this is one my favourite movies i cannot give it perfect 10 i am tempted do so as great as it is it could have potentially been even greater movie if it was handled with some more subtlety like irinjal rightly said example fight scenes were relevant plot but bit out line with realistic tone film even with mohanlals larger than life character antagonist shekharan could have been so much better than bland grimacing napoleon imagine someone versatile like siddique as mundakkal shekharan sadly his versatility was exploited much later,0.5896577380952381,0.36309523809523814,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9,Nobody could have done it better,"I'm a self-declared mohanlal fan in spite of his recent crap releases. I have watched devasuram umpteen number of times and every time i watch it i do realise that it is not his best performance but then what makes me watch this film is that perhaps there is nobody in Indian cinema who can do that role better than him. When mangalessery Neelakantan depicts his street fighter and spendthrift image i got to believe it. He doesn't leave a chance to question his different forms of dominance over society in the film as questionable from the analysing viewer point of view. His arrogance has a charm not just to the people whom he insults but also to me as a viewer. Its amazing how this man can control his histrionics so well. His scolding of Warrier ironically exudes a kind of respect that probably is the best in Indian films,famous for its father-son relationship dramas,though they are not father-son. His subsequent change of attitude(after knowing the truth)is fantastic.and so is his subtle romance with revathi who herself is very good in this.

Mohanlal plays the character of Mangalassery Neelakanthan who is a rich brash guy who has no respect for rules or law. He and his good for nothing friends spend their time drinking and fighting. But certain incidents force Neelakanthan to revisit his ways and become a good person. Revathy plays a powerful role in the movie. The movie shows the versatility of the actor Mohan Lal as a brutal feudal lord initially and then later becoming more human.

8,"More than critics, it's An Audience friendly classic. A Mohanlal phrenesis in the tale of retaliation and redemption.","Devasuram (1993) : Brief Review -More than critics, it's An Audience friendly classic. A Mohanlal phrenesis in the tale of retaliation and redemption. Devasuram is one of the most popular Malayalam film of 90s and highly successful as well and the reasons for it are definitely appropriate. Like i mentioned earlier, this is a film for audience more than critics because the ultimate goal of the film was to meet up the expectations and assumptions of audience's mind during the narration. See, it looks familiar to many gangster flicks of Hollywood made in 40s or for more popular instance we have many South flicks made in late 80s and early 90s just before this. While most of the films clearly mentioned their protagonist as a gangster which i feel leaves a very negative impact, Devasuram makes the protagonist look like a postive character despite his wrongdoings. The film is about Neelakanthan, who squanders away the inheritance left by his father. However, his life turns upside down when his mother reveals a terrible secret on her deathbed that changes the course of his life. His battle against his existence teaches him the value of life and goodwill which ultimately turns him into a Messiah kind of guy. Now of course because it is a 90s flick and very much in mainstream zone, it has those elements like Fights, Rivalry and Love-story to make it a commercial film. Thankfully, these factors don't cross the limits and main structure of the storyline remains unchanged. Mohanlal is like on a riot mode in the film. This is yet another powerful act from him whereas Revathi also leaves a solid impact. The rest of the cast is very supportive, music is Decent, dialogues are good, screenplay is engaging and the best thing is I. V. Sasi's direction. His grip on his storytelling leaves no loopes, in fact, it does much better than its potential just because Sasi understood the limits of the script and then explored it beautifully.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",more than critics its audience friendly classic mohanlal phrenesis tale retaliation redemption,devasuram 1993 brief review more than critics its audience friendly classic mohanlal phrenesis tale retaliation redemption devasuram is one most popular malayalam film 90s highly successful as well reasons it are definitely appropriate like i mentioned earlier this is film audience more than critics because ultimate goal film was meet up expectations assumptions audiences mind during narration see it looks familiar many gangster flicks hollywood made 40s or more popular instance we have many south flicks made late 80s early 90s just before this while most films clearly mentioned their protagonist as gangster which i feel leaves very negative impact devasuram makes protagonist look like postive character despite his wrongdoings film is about neelakanthan who squanders away inheritance left by his father however his life turns upside down when his mother reveals terrible secret her deathbed that changes course his life his battle against his existence teaches him value life goodwill which ultimately turns him into messiah kind guy now course because it is 90s flick very much mainstream zone it has those elements like fights rivalry love story make it commercial film thankfully these factors dont cross limits main structure storyline remains unchanged mohanlal is like riot mode film this is yet another powerful act him whereas revathi also leaves solid impact rest cast is very supportive music is decent dialogues are good screenplay is engaging best thing is i v sasis direction his grip his storytelling leaves no loopes fact it does much better than its potential just because sasi understood limits script then explored it beautifully rating 8 10 by,0.5481975308641976,0.2656913580246913,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10,Neelan..One of the most powerful character witnessed in movies..,"Mangalasheri Neelakandan, the name itself creates awe and hero worship. Easily the most powerful characters created in Malayalam cinema. Neelkandan, the feudal lord is cruel, alcholic, male chauvinist, goes to any extend for his win. He is a great patron of arts and proud of his family heritage. I just don't want to go into contents of Devasuram as there are no words to describe the beauty of this masterpiece. Full marks to the director for ensuring that the heroism of Neelan is depicted by the tiniest of characters. Devasuram belonged to I.V.Sasi the director, Ranjith for his heart touching script and all the actors in the movie be it Nedumudi Venu, Revathi, Napolean and so on. But above all Devasuram and Mangalasheri Neelakandan would never be a part of your soul without the genius of Mohanlal. The genius makes you wonder with his subtle acting whether displaying the anger, sorrow or helplessness of Neelan. Sir its a honor and privilege to be a mallayali and watch you in on screen. For me the story of Devasuram ends there and don't want to see Ravanaprabhu the sequel.

7,More a powerful romance than an action flick,Not many films of Mohanlal combines the romantic aspect as well as the action parts well. This film appears to belong to the minority. There is real chemistry between Revathi and Lal. This film also has one of my favorite scenes. The sequence where Revathi upstages Lal after dancing for him is certainly an all time great scene. All the characters are etched well in this film (a rarity in Malayalam films). The only short comings are the allownces made for audiences in the form of fight sequences. The movie could have been so much stronger had it been dealt with a little more subtleness.,more powerful romance than action flick,not many films mohanlal combines romantic aspect as well as action parts well this film appears belong minority there is real chemistry between revathi lal this film also has one my favorite scenes sequence where revathi upstages lal after dancing him is certainly all time great scene all characters are etched well this film rarity malayalam films only short comings are allownces made audiences form fight sequences movie could have been so much stronger had it been dealt with little more subtleness,0.5214285714285715,0.19845238095238096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"

The vulnerability is exposed when the lord is told about his adoption as a kid by his ailing mother. What happens after that is depicted to absolute perfection by Mohanlal.
