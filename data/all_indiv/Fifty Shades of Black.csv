2.0,I tried to like it. I really did...,"Let me preface this by saying I have never seen 50 Shades of Grey. I've seen the reviews, I know the story, but after seeing 50 Shades of Black I feel like I've seen the actual movie it was parodying. Wayans' comedies have devolved from clever self-aware satires to blatant movie rip-offs with sporadic laughs. The difference is, unlike the Haunted House movies, there are next to no laughs in 50 Shades of Black. It's essentially deconstructing every scene in 50 Shades of Grey to show the audience how dumb it is, which would be fine if it was actually funny. But no, this humor is scraped right from the bottom of the barrel, reusing the same stupid gags from previous spoofs and rehashed awkward shock ""humor"" that comes across more cringe-worthy than anything.I like Marlon Wayans, I really do. He seems like an awesome guy and he was actually a great writer one point, and a great actor too (to this day I'm blown away by his performance in Requiem for a Dream), but his talents must have gone to his head because he isn't tapping into his genius anymore. It's just easy joke after easy joke, and as simple as the jokes are, none of them land. In fact, at one point after a painfully awkward dinner scene that went on 5 minutes too long, I couldn't help but laugh, for the wrong reasons mind you, thinking, ""Jesus Christ, this is a real movie?"" It was painful. All of me wanted this movie to be good, but part of me knew it would be a disaster. Well, that part of me was right. Sure, I chuckled at a few scenes, but I also chuckled a few times in A Haunted House 2 and that's still a terrible movie. The difference is 50 Shades of Grey is even lazier and somehow even less clever than AHH2. I anxiously await the day the Wayans brothers come out with another great spoof movie, but I have a feeling it's going to be a long, long wait.",i tried like it i really did,let me preface this by saying i have never seen 50 shades grey ive seen reviews i know story but after seeing 50 shades black i feel like ive seen actual movie it was parodying wayans comedies have devolved clever self aware satires blatant movie rip offs with sporadic laughs difference is unlike haunted house movies there are next no laughs 50 shades black its essentially deconstructing every scene 50 shades grey show audience how dumb it is which would be fine if it was actually funny but no this humor is scraped right bottom barrel reusing same stupid gags previous spoofs rehashed awkward shock humor that comes across more cringe worthy than anything i like marlon wayans i really do he seems like awesome guy he was actually great writer one point great actor too this day im blown away by his performance requiem dream but his talents must have gone his head because he isnt tapping into his genius anymore its just easy joke after easy joke as simple as jokes are none them land fact at one point after painfully awkward dinner scene that went 5 minutes too long i couldnt help but laugh wrong reasons mind you thinking jesus christ this is real movie it was painful all me wanted this movie be good but part me knew it would be disaster well that part me was right sure i chuckled at few scenes but i also chuckled few times haunted house 2 thats still terrible movie difference is 50 shades grey is even lazier somehow even less clever than ahh2 i anxiously await day wayans brothers come out with another great spoof movie but i have feeling its going be long long wait,0.518245701058201,0.046453373015873024,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
3.0,It's time Marlon Wayans and Michael Tiddes be held accountable for ushering in the real lowest common denominator of humor,"You would think with all the accumulated earnings the Wayans brothers, Shawn and Marlon, have obtained after being on Television and in films for years that they would invest their money and their time in projects that would be a bit more thoughtful and entertaining. Instead, ever since the runaway success of ""A Haunted House"" in 2013, the two, particularly Marlon, have been keen on making movies that fit the bill for the lowest common denominator of entertainment. ""Fifty Shades of Black,"" a horribly obvious and persistently unfunny array of cheapshots at the erotic novel/film series that is already too easy to joke about, continues Marlon's streak and incredible failing to make something out of his Baby Way Productions company.I've always found it interesting that while Tyler Perry's films are anything but consistent, and there are about an equal number of bad films in his catalog as good films, he often gets blamed for making films about black people that cater to the lowest common denominator and showcase them in a negative light, yet the recent collaborations of Marlon Wayans and Michael Tiddes go pretty much unscathed. These are films that evoke some of the most putrid and ugly stereotypes about nearly every race and, for that matter, exist simply as unapologetically crude and contrived projects that do nothing but attempt to evoke laughs based on brand-recognition. These films are just a slight notch above the dreaded works of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.As hinted, ""Fifty Shades of Black"" is a parody of ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" and it takes pretty much the safest, most convenient route to parody the film by making the jokes largely centered around the absurdity of BDSM and its culture, race and ethnic humor, the ordinariness and ""ugliness"" of its lead female character, and the enigma surrounding its titular character, who in this case, is Christian Black (Marlon Wayans). Christian is a multi-millionaire mogul who begins a sexual relationship with his new intern, Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) and what entails is a relationship filled with sex, sexual violence, and downright bizarre encounters.While whatever Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison gang is cooking up this year is likely to get plenty of Razzie nominations, Marlon Wayans and his cast of familiar faces such as Affion Crockett, Missi Pyle, Mike Epps, Fred Willard, and more should be looking at the same award. It's incredibly rare to see a cast ostensibly operate on auto-pilot and look like the end product bearing some essence of quality is the furthest thing from their minds, but perhaps given the lazy screen writing of Rick Alvarez and Wayans himself, this was to be expected.Shockingly enough, ""Fifty Shades of Black"" offers more laughs than both of the ""Haunted House"" films put together, especially during a sequence that parodies one of last year's Best Picture contenders at the Academy Awards. However, in order to get to this sequence, one has to succumb to the drudgery of enough racial and bathroom humor - so much that it gives Laura Mulvey's concept of ""phallocentrism"" a whole different angle to explore - that it ultimately isn't worth sitting through the amount of trivial nonsense to get to that particular scene.We're not even in February yet and this year has already been incredibly interesting for comedies. After seeing ""Ride Along 2,"" I didn't think many more comedies of the year would get much worse than that. Then I saw ""Dirty Grandpa"" the following week and I thought the same thing; there was most likely the weakest comedy of 2016 that I would have to sit through. Now, almost exactly a week later, I've seen ""Fifty Shades of Black,"" and if this isn't the worst comedy of 2016, I seriously fear what I have to endure in the coming eleven months.",its time marlon wayans michael tiddes be held accountable ushering real lowest common denominator humor,you would think with all accumulated earnings wayans brothers shawn marlon have obtained after being television films years that they would invest their money their time projects that would be bit more thoughtful entertaining instead ever since runaway success haunted house 2013 two particularly marlon have been keen making movies that fit bill lowest common denominator entertainment fifty shades black horribly obvious persistently unfunny array cheapshots at erotic novel film series that is already too easy joke about continues marlons streak incredible failing make something out his baby way productions company ive always found it interesting that while tyler perrys films are anything but consistent there are about equal number bad films his catalog as good films he often gets blamed making films about black people that cater lowest common denominator showcase them negative light yet recent collaborations marlon wayans michael tiddes go pretty much unscathed these are films that evoke some most putrid ugly stereotypes about nearly every race that matter exist simply as unapologetically crude contrived projects that do nothing but attempt evoke laughs based brand recognition these films are just slight notch above dreaded works jason friedberg aaron seltzer as hinted fifty shades black is parody fifty shades grey it takes pretty much safest most convenient route parody film by making jokes largely centered around absurdity bdsm its culture race ethnic humor ordinariness ugliness its lead female character enigma surrounding its titular character who this case is christian black marlon wayans christian is multi millionaire mogul who begins sexual relationship with his new intern hannah steale kali hawk what entails is relationship filled with sex sexual violence downright bizarre encounters while whatever adam sandler his happy madison gang is cooking up this year is likely get plenty razzie nominations marlon wayans his cast familiar faces such as affion crockett missi pyle mike epps fred willard more should be looking at same award its incredibly rare see cast ostensibly operate auto pilot look like end product bearing some essence quality is furthest thing their minds but perhaps given lazy screen writing rick alvarez wayans himself this was be expected shockingly enough fifty shades black offers more laughs than both haunted house films put together especially during sequence that parodies one last years best picture contenders at academy awards however order get this sequence one has succumb drudgery enough racial bathroom humor so much that it gives laura mulveys concept phallocentrism whole different angle explore that it ultimately isnt worth sitting through amount trivial nonsense get that particular scene were not even february yet this year has already been incredibly interesting comedies after seeing ride along 2 i didnt think many more comedies year would get much worse than that then i saw dirty grandpa following week i thought same thing there was most likely weakest comedy 2016 that i would have sit through now almost exactly week later ive seen fifty shades black if this isnt worst comedy 2016 i seriously fear what i have endure coming eleven months,0.4947756788665879,0.10559450019677294,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,The Fifty Shades you should see,"People who hate Fifty Shades Of Grey (I bet there's a lot of you'se out there} will be appeased. Here, you pi..ed off many, will be compensated for your suffering. This comedy spoof, ala, Wayans, almost outdoes itself, near up there on the comedy scale with films like Bruno. They'll be chuckles aloud, in continuity. And we know if the Wayans are involved, we're not gonna be disappointed, smart brothers who know comedy but smart comedy with some gags you never see coming. They have an original style of comedy that's always a winning formula. What this film does, is that is it surprisingly sticks to the story and scene structure as the other one, almost to the letter, with some cute changes, one I particularly liked. Here, this one really takes the p..s out of the 2015 bore snore. Exciting lead, Wayans, replaces our dull Dorman, really throwing spark into the role, in top gear as Christian Black, while this time, our English lit student/journo replacement/part time hardware shop worker, and ordinary, known as Hanna, not Anastasia Steele, is wonderfully played by Hawk. From comical whippings to dejected, non helicopter/jet rides, this Fifty Shades has it all. We have some really crude moments involving male anatomy, someone who's really well endowed, shall we say. Hanna Steele's more likable flatmate here, is a chubby Rebel Wilson type who craves sex and food, and food, and food. Again we have many movie references (something I'm not really impressed by) a bit too many here, with a little bit of Zero Dark Thirty and I Spit On Your Grave 3, thrown in as well, as well as the dropping of a famous Porky's (easy lay) character. A couple of surprising co stars show up in this, like a still radiant and refined, Jane Seymour, and shocking as it is surprising, a cameo by a much recently missed Brady. This one has better everything, better script, better acting, entertainment value and appeal, for a number of reasons, most of them, laughably related. Fifty Shade's haters will love this Fifty Shades, trust me. You want something done right, different and smart, get a Wayans to do it.

,Fifty Shades of Crap!,"The Fifty Shades of Grey, which this movie is spoofing, was nearly as bad as this one....Nearly. When i saw the preview for this movie i was actually excited to go and watch it. I eventually got tired of watching thrillers and action movies and wanted to just laugh at stupid people. The problem is i only got the stupid people part but no laughs.It's was dull, egregious, embarrassing, and just plain stupid. The funny days of Scary Movie 1 and 2 are long gone for the creators of this crap fest. Their once promising comedy future has inevitably burned out.I don not recommend this movie at all. Under no circumstances should anyone view this garbage. Side effects will include: abdominal pain, lower your IQ level, headache, anger, throwing objects at the screen, and financial bankruptcy.A huge number of the black audience actually got up half way through the movie and walked out, but then there were only 15 people in the theater opening day, I wish i did the same but i stayed since i spend $22 dollars and was trying to get my money's worth. It wasn't. Watch Kung Fu Panda 3. You'll get more laughs and joy for your money.

8.0,Funny if you know what kind of joke to expect,"People should be used to the kind of humor coming from movies with Marlon Wayans, so I don't get the point of people complaining the humor was offensive. If it's not your thing it's obvious you won't like it, the least you can do is learn that some actors/directors make movies you simply don't like.I only new enough about 50 shades (the book) and can't tell there is no need to watch the movie before watching this. At the beginning the movie doesn't really know where it's going, but after a while it finds its pace and delivers.

1.0,50 Shades Of Shite,"After weeks of being teased by the trailer I was so excited to see this film! I was expecting 50 Shades Of Grey meets Scary Movie- you know, a parody that actually worked. But I couldn't have been more wrong. It was more 50 Shades Of Shite. Five minutes in to the film and I knew i'd spend the remaining 1 hour 27 minutes with my palm on my forehead, cringing for my life at it's stupidity.The film had potential to be very funny but the idea was crushed by the terrible acting, and pathetic excuse for dark humor. I can account for the two times, throughout the whole movie, I let out a slight giggle- well it was more of a scoff but at least it triggered some kind of emotion eh. As a kid I loved the Haunted House and Marlon Wayans was brilliant in it; I think this is why I expected great things. I think he should stick to his PG rating films. It's crude sexual content contained stereotypical 'humor' that could be considered racist towards African American's and many people could take offence. I find it offensive that we are expected to pay as much as £5 to watch this. Watching paint dry is more entertaining. I was counting down the painful minutes, praying for the movie to end. When it did, sheer disappointment and disgust was how I was left feeling about this movie. This film is a waste of time and a waste of a cinema slot.",50 shades shite,after weeks being teased by trailer i was so excited see this film i was expecting 50 shades grey meets scary movie you know parody that actually worked but i couldnt have been more wrong it was more 50 shades shite five minutes film i knew id spend remaining 1 hour 27 minutes with my palm my forehead cringing my life at its stupidity film had potential be very funny but idea was crushed by terrible acting pathetic excuse dark humor i can account two times throughout whole movie i let out slight giggle well it was more scoff but at least it triggered some kind emotion eh as kid i loved haunted house marlon wayans was brilliant it i think this is why i expected great things i think he should stick his pg rating films its crude sexual content contained stereotypical humor that could be considered racist towards african americans many people could take offence i find it offensive that we are expected pay as much as 5 watch this watching paint dry is more entertaining i was counting down painful minutes praying movie end when it did sheer disappointment disgust was how i was left feeling about this movie this film is waste time waste cinema slot,0.5425925925925925,-0.0033068783068782794,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.27}"
7.0,"Not for everyone, but I enjoyed it","This was my first movie at a new cinema in my town, and it was...nice. I really don't like Fifty Shades of Grey (the original one), but I enjoyed this parody, and man, it has some damn hot scenes, not a movie to see with your family because it's almost porn sometimes, in my opinion. The actors doesn't perform too well, it's that kind of comedy filled with stupidity sometimes, especially from Marlon Wayans who likes to behave like a child in some of his movies, but I think the man it's hilarious the e way he is. Well, I don't have something else to say about this movie, I've seen it almost half a year on 30 January when it first launched in Romania.

5.0,More Misses Than Hits,"I saw ""Fifty Shades of Black"", starring Marlon Wayans-The Heat, White Chicks; Kali Hawk-Bridesmaids, Couples retreat and Affion Crockett-The Wedding Ringer, Never Back Down.In case you could not tell from the title, this is a parody of '50 Shades of Grey'. Marlon plays the wealthy business man that tries to seduce the innocent young girl, Kali, into his world of sexual romper room. Affion plays Marlon's rather 'talented' brother, and when I say 'talented', I mean with the ladies. There is a scene where Affion has just finished satisfying a lady and is nude as he walks by the coffee table, knocking things to the floor with his.....appendage. The movie is good and bad; some jokes are funny but most are just silly as they seem to be trying too hard for a laugh. There are a few cameos. I remember seeing Jane Seymour, Florence Henderson, Michael Epps and Fred Willard. I guess it depends on how much you like this type of humor; it's not for everyone. Marlon is a co-writer of the movie. There is a lot of graphic language and nudity, and I have nothing against nudity, but here, there is more of the male kind and not enough of the female kind. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It would be alright, as a rental, if you are a fan.

8.0,Too Soon?,"Holy crap, I'm might get slack for this and I might be whack, but damn, did I crack up on this blackspoof.I have heard nothing but bad things about this movie. Up and down, people and critics hated it. Plus it came and went like how fast the Christian in this film had sex. But, 30 seconds in, a laugh was forced out of me and I found myself laughing through to the end.That said, yes, admittedly, a ton of jokes did not work. Many forced, many just retreaded bad stereotypes they ran into the ground. But, for the times that they hit the head of the nail...I was almost in tears laughing. And to top it off, it was 100x more enjoyable than the ""serious"" movie it spoofed: Fifty Shades of Grey. Come to think of it, I laughed in both movies. Only this movie was intended to make me laugh.Like the other Wayans' project, Scary Movie, which, for the record, is way funnier, the movie is almost a shot-by-shot remake/satire of Fifty Shades of Grey. Sadly, as much as I've tried to forget that ""experience,"" I recall a ton here in Black as was in Grey. Again, there are a ton of scenes and jokes that just didn't work and were foreseen minutes in advance, but for the parts that did have me bust out loud, it worked. I know the criticisms, wait, actually, make that I *don't* know the criticisms. I haven't read, heard or seen anyone else's reviews – something I don't do before I see a movie and especially before I write my take, but I have heard people didn't like this much. I just could not hold back some laughter. I truly had a great time here. Enough to see a second time? Eh, maybe. Perhaps I was just in a good mood. I dunno. But, I do know this: I just finished this and I did have a good time here. Take that for what it's worth.

4.0,50 shades of whack! Which is 49 shades better than the movie they parody,"I find it strange that Marlon Wayans found the need to parody what is already hands down the funnest movie of 2015. Does a bad movie, really need a parody? Seems redundant, but they did it.50 shades of black has some decent jokes that poke fun at how outrageous 50 Shades of Grey is (although my favorite bit was one that parodied Whiplash with Florence Henderson playing a music teacher training young boys to use their ""instruments""), but the laughs are not constant enough through the entire movie to justify the money spent. It's good that Wanyans has no problem making light of himself, cause it's those skits that made for the most laugh out loud experience , but he also has no problem making a joke at someone else's expense. I probability would not care if the jokes were funny. There recent though, with a joke about the 2016 presidential campaign thrown in the mix.

1.0,"So awful it makes you love ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" in comparison!","""Fifty Shades of Black"" is yet another film in the idiotic teenager parody genre. This overused genre consists of many movies currently on IMDB's Bottom 100 list....with the likes of ""Disaster Movie"" (#1), ""Epic Movie"" (#12), ""Date Movie"" (#24), ""Scary Movie V"" (#50), ""The Starving Games"" (#44) and ""Extreme Movie"" (#99). ""Fifty Shades of Black"", incidentally, is #65 on this infamous list of badness. Unlike other films in this god-awful genre, this film is a parody of another film on the infamous Bottom 100 list, the original ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" (#92).This film is a bit different from the other crappy parodies I mentioned above. It is more a silly version of the original film and is NOT a parody of a dozen or more other films (which the above garbage films all are). Also, not surprisingly, it's MUCH more sexually-oriented...as ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" was a highly sexualized story. But this is much more crude than I even expected...and crude and unfunny scenes were piled on atop the other! It also has a lot of content that might make the more left-leaning audience members cringe or become furious. The leading man in this film is rich and successful like the one in the original story...BUT because he's black (Marlon Wayans), he says he made his fortune selling crack and sucking....well...IMDB won't let me say more about that. This is NOT the most positive and uplifting sort of black man, that's for sure!As far as the story goes, it's terrible....so terrible I found I much preferred the original film...which I still strongly dislike. Yes, they managed to make a worse version of an already terrible movie! Offensive, brain-numbingly stupid, crude beyond belief, and, sadly, a film marketed mostly towards younger folks (whose growing brains really don't need this!). Currently, this film is #65 on the Bottom 100....I think that is way, way too generous...especially after seeing the Florence Henderson (I am NOT kidding) sex scene!",so awful it makes you love fifty shades gray comparison,fifty shades black is yet another film idiotic teenager parody genre this overused genre consists many movies currently imdbs bottom 100 list with likes disaster movie epic movie date movie scary movie v starving games extreme movie fifty shades black incidentally is this infamous list badness unlike other films this god awful genre this film is parody another film infamous bottom 100 list original fifty shades gray this film is bit different other crappy parodies i mentioned above it is more silly version original film is not parody dozen or more other films which above garbage films all are also not surprisingly its much more sexually oriented as fifty shades gray was highly sexualized story but this is much more crude than i even expected crude unfunny scenes were piled atop other it also has lot content that might make more left leaning audience members cringe or become furious leading man this film is rich successful like one original story but because hes black marlon wayans he says he made his fortune selling crack sucking well imdb wont let me say more about that this is not most positive uplifting sort black man thats sure as far as story goes its terrible so terrible i found i much preferred original film which i still strongly dislike yes they managed make worse version already terrible movie offensive brain numbingly stupid crude beyond belief sadly film marketed mostly towards younger folks whose growing brains really dont need this currently this film is bottom 100 i think that is way way too generous especially after seeing florence henderson i am not kidding sex scene,0.6292242093061765,-0.06906110283159463,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10.0,This movie is...marvelous.,"I've been a big Wayans brothers fan ever since the release of their 1996 movie, ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood"". Before that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too artsy, too intellectual. It was on ""Don't Be a Menace..."" where Marlon Wayans' presence became more apparent. ""Fifty Shades of Black"" an epic meditation on intangibility, at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding movies. Look to the brilliant ensemble playing of Wayans, Hawk and Zigrino. You can practically feel every nuance of every human emotion. In terms of comical craftsmanship and sheer beauty of Hawk's boobs, this move hits a new peak of professionalism. The whole movie has a clear, crisp look and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the script a big boost. He's been compared to Chris Rock, but I think Marlon has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. Take the ""Wesley Snipes tax"" gag. In this segment, Marlon Wayans addresses the problem of abusive political authority. I think that this movie is Wayans' undisputed masterpiece. The script is so witty, that most people probably don't think about deep underlying themes, but they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the author himself. Most importantly, Hannah's fiery monologue at the end of the movie encourages us to oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal rights for women. Also, the masterfully crafted politically correct script reminds us that we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people.",this movie is marvelous,ive been big wayans brothers fan ever since release their 1996 movie dont be menace south central while drinking your juice hood before that i really didnt understand any their work it was too artsy too intellectual it was dont be menace where marlon wayans presence became more apparent fifty shades black epic meditation intangibility at same time it deepens enriches meaning preceding movies look brilliant ensemble playing wayans hawk zigrino you can practically feel every nuance every human emotion terms comical craftsmanship sheer beauty hawks boobs this move hits new peak professionalism whole movie has clear crisp look new sheen consummate professionalism that gives script big boost hes been compared chris rock but i think marlon has more bitter cynical sense humor take wesley snipes tax gag this segment marlon wayans addresses problem abusive political authority i think that this movie is wayans undisputed masterpiece script is so witty that most people probably dont think about deep underlying themes but they should because its not just about pleasures conformity importance trends its also personal statement about author himself most importantly hannahs fiery monologue at end movie encourages us oppose racial discrimination promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights women also masterfully crafted politically correct script reminds us that we have promote general social concern less materialism young people,0.4737041467304625,0.207177033492823,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.44}"

The story is a direct parody of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" where college student, Hannah Steele played by Kali Hawk, falls for unorthodox billionaire, Christian Black played by Marlon Wayans, but his sexual practices put a strain on what could become a beautiful relationship. The story is there for what could have been a heavy dose of comedy, but it doesn't seem to mesh well as the film could have.The director, Michael Tiddes known for over the top comedies like ""A Haunted House"" (2013), stayed true the style of comedy. Ever comedic take had funny laced in the dialogue or visuals and then amplified to drive it home. Occasionally it was a bit much. The music that filled most of the film was very intertwining and relatively spot on but, there were a few lapses in the sound department. Some of the voice-overs missed the mark and took away from the film.

1.0,Film Review: Fifty Shades of Black,"It was only a matter of time that someone came along and spoofed the widely popular and highly alluring pop-culture phenomenon that was Fifty Shades of Grey. What isn't surprising is that spoof specialist and kinda, sorta washed up actor/writer Marlon Wayans was the one to do so. Wayans, whose previous parody films include A Haunted House 1 & 2, Dance Flick and Scary Movie 1-4 brings forth a very important question with his newest spoof feature Fifty Shades of Black; is the spoof film finally, officially dead? Its hard to believe but, after such classics as Airplane!, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and yes, even the original Scary Movie, the spoof film may slowly if not almost entirely die off and be resting in peace very soon.The world currently is one that is obsessed with social media platforms and media within these social networks. Thanks to applications such as Vine, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube, it seems that audiences everywhere are capable of finding comedy and entertainment, not only within the comfort of their own homes, but as easily and accessibly, within moments, within the palms of their hand.When the dawn of the television was upon us, people everywhere thought that televisions were going to destroy Hollywood and the history of feature films altogether; it didn't. With the rise of the Internet and the quickly developing moment of streaming and illegally downloading films and music online, people soon thought that the future of movies and music was on its way on the decline. Yet, in 2015 no less, two of the highest grossing films of all-time were released, and more than ever, the profitability of music has never been better. So, how and why is the spoof film genre dying slowly but surely?The thing about entertainment in 2016 is that, entertainment isn't merely measured but numbers and margins, but by memories and moments of experience and spectacle, with margins and numbers as well. Entertainment is constantly evolving, and the forms in which we consume entertainment maintains the ways in which we determine whether the entertainment itself is viable, or not. The thing with earlier spoof films like the ones that were mentioned above are, in order to consume such comedy, going to the movie theatres and watching it for yourself was the only way of consumption. Now a days, not only are films, genres and characters spoofed on the daily, but pop culture, with the help of social media, spoofs the crap out of anything and everything. Don't think thats the case? Think back, just in 2015, to all the spoofs you saw online about Adele's song Hello, Drake's music video to Hotline Bling, as well as anything else flooding the front pages of your vine, Instagram and Facebook news feeds.The beauty behind the genius in the earlier spoof films of the 80's and 90's was that accessibility was limited and, these films weren't just spoofing a specific movie, having limited content to work with. Think of Austin Powers for example, it wasn't just a spoof on spy films and a filmography of more than a dozen Bond films at that time, but also a genre, the unbelievability of a lifestyle or profession little to nothing is known about, as well as providing a fantasy for the possibility of the many beauties the life of what an international person of mystery might really be like. Sure, Black may spoof Kim K for a second, the Weeknd here and there, but overall, these small and insignificant and highly forgettable inclusions did nothing to elevate the plot or humour of the film overall.If you're wondering why I haven't really mentioned the plot line or story of Black, well, thats because the film is basically a shot-for-shot carbon copy of the original Grey film, with added crass and crude black jokes included, sexual innuendos juiced up to the max and of course, taking what the original did, and making it funny by stripping away its glamorous and polished exterior; essentially, making it real world scary for real life people. No matter how you look at it, regardless of how much money you have, any girl would be scared of having a wealthy man stalking you at work asking for ropes and zip-ties and what not.What I found super interesting with Black was how the film is slowly accepting and transitioning from movie stars, to social media stars starring within feature films. Sure we've seen Vine stars make cameos in films before, like Brittany Furland in last year's We Are Your Friends, but in Black, social media icon King Back/Andrew Bachelor has a very prominent role as the not so subtle yet totally obvious best friend Jesse that wants a piece, like any other straight male friend wants from their female friends. Bach represents not only a dominance of social media within feature films, but perhaps, the next phase and new generation of movies stars tomorrow. Plus, is it just me or does Bach remind anyone else of a younger Will Smith?Sure Black states the obvious humours that we found in the original Grey film, but the beauty of Fifty Shades of Grey was that it knew that it was going to be the basis to much criticism, the butt end of endless jokes and spoof online for weeks and months after its release. Luckily for the film, made on only $40 million dollar, its return really laughed in all the faces of sceptics and all its negative criticism. Fifty Shades of Grey broke these records; highest grossing film directed by a woman, highest grossing February release and #1 President Day 4-Day Holiday Weekend (all of these numbers NOT adjusted for inflation). So I guess, the joke is on us, especially since they numbers and records are bound to be broken once the newest instalment of the series is released in 2017.",film review fifty shades black,it was only matter time that someone came along spoofed widely popular highly alluring pop culture phenomenon that was fifty shades grey what isnt surprising is that spoof specialist kinda sorta washed up
