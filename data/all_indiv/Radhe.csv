So thank you for adding Randeep Hooda in the starcast, otherwise I would not have gone past first five minutes of the movie.Salman, your entry scene was just not bearable. I mean WHAT were you thinking? Your body language, dialouge delivery and expressions were so bad. It is as if like you did'nt know how to act or was acting just for the sake of it.For me the biggest letdown was not the movie or the script but it was you. You were the most negative part in the movie. Had it been any other actor, or even a newcommer, this movie could have been a bit watchable.And for Prabhudeva, please stop making fun of yourself.

1,Absolute Trash! Ruins the legacy of a Well entertainer Wanted..,"First of all let me make clear that the reviews that are posted here- positive or negative are from the fans and anti Salman people. Now moving to the film, it takes us back to the point where Radhe ended the dukedom of Gani Bhai.. However this time the film runs on a tedious note with only engaging in parts. Salman as Radhe goes on a manhunt to look for the wealthiest man of Mumbai secretly running a crime syndicate. The story from onwards is predictable.. It is that old formula of Salman hunting baddies but this doesn't work time and again.Pertinent to mention that the scenes between Radhe and Randeep Hooda just before the intermission are good. However that is not enough to make one glued for more than 2 hours. The signature shirt scene of Salman is there well at the end. However this looks monotonous with every passing Salman film. It can give you cheers in first some shows but won't connect with the audience.Acting wise Salman has done that acting which he is known for. Disha has a small role in parts. Jacky is ignored. However Randeep Hooda is brilliant.On the whole it is a big big let down..

1,You Deserve Better,"Review By Kamal KGood lord, viewers deserve better than this! The directors that make fortunes off commercial cinema, the actors who we've elevated to superstardom, the producers that hold the power to greenlight projects-they all need to do better. This will simply not do.No one's even pretending to act in this sham of a movie. Salman Khan, ageing ungracefully, with a heroine half his age, recycles dialogues from his own movies, takes a lift to 'Galaxy apartments', and looks directly at the screen to wish 'Eid Mubarak'.The story is convoluted and disjointed. When the crime rate goes up in Mumbai and young ones are being lured by the drug mafia, the cops decide to call on Radhe (Salman Khan) who has '97 encounters and 23 transfers' behind him. The tired dialogue explains that he doesn't follow rules but can get the job done. Hearing their plea (""police department ko tumhaari zaroorat hai""), Radhe takes up the job swaggering, scowling and never in a uniform.Jackie Shroff appears as his comical, insecure senior and Disha Patani, a fantastic dancer with sketchy acting skills, can also be seen in a thankless role that insults everyone's intelligence. Women are usually not given their due in director Prabhu Deva's movies, and here too, we see an objectified, air-headed character with no depth or ambitions/interests of her own.After their meet-cute, when Dia (Disha Patani) asks him what he does for a living, the 50-plus Khan replies that he's a struggling model. Of course, she believes him. She helps him with a photoshoot where he is referred to as the 'new boy' and 'cute boy' leading up to the mandatory shirtless scene.'Radhe...' is based on Korean film 'The Outlaws'. Judging from the trailer, the Hindi film has twisted the original's premise beyond recognition. Instead of borrowing from their films, it would be wonderful if our filmmakers could take inspiration from the bold strides taken by South Korean cinema.Not as disastrous as Dabangg 3, this one comes close. Why after that debacle, would the same producer-director team-up for another vanity project is a mystery.Meanwhile the villains have dialogues like 'Minister ko paisa khila diya hai.' Randeep Hooda as the antagonist is a carboard character but his talent shines through anyway.Jackie Shroff's recent film choices are befuddling. After the Hello Charlie where he was in a gorilla costume for most of the movie, this is another odd choice.With decades of superstardom, Salman Khan carries with him the capacity to make a shift in the industry. And yet he chooses to make this. It's disappointing, really.We're living in unprecedented, heartbreaking times. If we are to watch cinema, it has to be the kind that feeds the soul. This movie is depleting and leaves you tired.To the viewers who are ok going through an unbearable movie for a few songs and a couple of Khan's shirtless scenes, I just have this to say- you deserve better.",you deserve better,review by kamal kgood lord viewers deserve better than this directors that make fortunes off commercial cinema actors who weve elevated superstardom producers that hold power greenlight projects they all need do better this will simply not do no ones even pretending act this sham movie salman khan ageing ungracefully with heroine half his age recycles dialogues his own movies takes lift galaxy apartments looks directly at screen wish eid mubarak story is convoluted disjointed when crime rate goes up mumbai young ones are being lured by drug mafia cops decide call radhe salman khan who has 97 encounters 23 transfers behind him tired dialogue explains that he doesnt follow rules but can get job done hearing their plea police department ko tumhaari zaroorat hai radhe takes up job swaggering scowling never uniform jackie shroff appears as his comical insecure senior disha patani fantastic dancer with sketchy acting skills can also be seen thankless role that insults everyones intelligence women are usually not given their due director prabhu devas movies here too we see objectified air headed character with no depth or ambitions interests her own after their meet cute when dia disha patani asks him what he does living 50 plus khan replies that hes struggling model course she believes him she helps him with photoshoot where he is referred as new boy cute boy leading up mandatory shirtless scene radhe is based korean film outlaws judging trailer hindi film has twisted originals premise beyond recognition instead borrowing their films it would be wonderful if our filmmakers could take inspiration bold strides taken by south korean cinema not as disastrous as dabangg 3 this one comes close why after that debacle would same producer director team up another vanity project is mystery meanwhile villains have dialogues like minister ko paisa khila diya hai randeep hooda as antagonist is carboard character but his talent shines through anyway jackie shroffs recent film choices are befuddling after hello charlie where he was gorilla costume most movie this is another odd choice with decades superstardom salman khan carries with him capacity make shift industry yet he chooses make this its disappointing really were living unprecedented heartbreaking times if we are watch cinema it has be kind that feeds soul this movie is depleting leaves you tired viewers who are ok going through unbearable movie few songs couple khans shirtless scenes i just have this say you deserve better,0.5650005696058327,0.1299043062200957,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.39}"
