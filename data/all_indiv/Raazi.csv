9,The director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat's shoes......top notch acting n direction.,"This is how Indian movies shud be made without the usual bollywood nonsense. Set during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the film concerns an Indian female spy Sehmat married to a Pakistani military man. I haven't read the book but I still thoroughly enjoyed this film. The director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat's shoes, the audience is privy to the information as she receives n passes on to the Intelligence bureau. Alia Bhatt as Sehmat did a terrific job n Vicky Kaushal as her husband was an icing on the cake. The scene of the marriage consummation is aptly placed. I am really surprised n happy that for the first time Bollywood hasn't demonized enemy soldiers. It is a slow burner, this is neither an Akshay/Salman/Sunny Deol movie. There are no action sequences or intense shootouts. Most of the film is shot in the house. This is entirely unglamorous, but the film does have an underlying tension n relies on the impending sense of dread which hangs over Sehmat's entire investigation. Ther r two scenes wher Sehmat is almost exposed n the reaction n facial expression of Alia during those two scenes were amazing. My only cribbing is why on earth the servant has to run or keep on running rather than alarm other people. Nevertheless a very solid n different Indian spy thriller. Happy Ramadan. Fasting is anti cancer.",director did masterful technique placing audience sehmats shoes top notch acting n direction,this is how indian movies shud be made without usual bollywood nonsense set during indo pakistani war 1971 film concerns indian female spy sehmat married pakistani military man i havent read book but i still thoroughly enjoyed this film director did masterful technique placing audience sehmats shoes audience is privy information as she receives n passes intelligence bureau alia bhatt as sehmat did terrific job n vicky kaushal as her husband was icing cake scene marriage consummation is aptly placed i am really surprised n happy that first time bollywood hasnt demonized enemy soldiers it is slow burner this is neither akshay salman sunny deol movie there are no action sequences or intense shootouts most film is shot house this is entirely unglamorous but film does have underlying tension n relies impending sense dread which hangs over sehmats entire investigation ther r two scenes wher sehmat is almost exposed n reaction n facial expression alia during those two scenes were amazing my only cribbing is why earth servant has run or keep running rather than alarm other people nevertheless very solid n different indian spy thriller happy ramadan fasting is anti cancer,0.5724074074074075,0.23240740740740745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10,A tight no-nonsense thriller with excellent acting,"Raazi does what very few Bollywood movies do right. It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her 'student of the year' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband's household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy's side, girl's side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with ""Indian culture"" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal's (Vicky Kaushal's) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but 'human' he is not. I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.",tight no nonsense thriller with excellent acting,raazi does what very few bollywood movies do right it pulls off tight script with good acting realistic believable storyline that leaves you edge your seat two hours film also manages maintain tight pace while building up towards impactful climax particular i think three things made it unforgettable firstly acting was point made movie what it turned out be alia bhatt is turning out be absolute genius has come long way her student year days there are very few her peer group that can do justice these kinds roles vicky kaushal was good as beguiled husband his restrained yet emotional male character supporting powerful female lead is bollywood rarity was thoroughly enjoyable others are point too with minor actors like jaideep ahlawat rajit kapoor delivering strong performances secondly movie turned out be tight point with no melodramatic displays emotion or sappy songs good old premises bride departing her husbands household presumably good arranged marriage with virtually unknown man eventual marriage consummation were all present theory these are all typically perfect opportunities inject unnecessary bridal parting songs lengthy wedding song dance sequences boys side girls side etc worst all song balancing sleaze with indian culture read censor board mandated restraint that plays when marriage is consummated this is typically couple kissing rolling around bed carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets but raazi eliminates all this fluff more leaving you wishing more movies would do away with crap favor keeping pace plot lastly most importantly raazi does justice complexity india pakistan conflict countries have shared history which makes war painfully more unique e g abdul oldest most faithful caretaker pakistani household is indian origin movie takes no sides shows you that humanity ruthlessness exist both sides this is significant departure patriotic films yesteryear we are habituated seeing good vs evil theme having pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers so you are simply not prepared empathize with iqbals vicky kaushals gentle persona when you do it his vulnerable humanity hits you like truck conversely hardened indian intelligence agent mir is many things during movie but human he is not i walked away theater understanding better nature such wars that real conflict is not over kashmir or between two sides or between ideologies real conflict is always fought within human heart between ruthless imperatives duty very human urges gentleness mercy love,0.4994822373393803,0.13414965986394556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8,A brilliantly written and executed film - works both as a taut spy thriller and an affecting human story,"Meghna Gulzar's Raazi is the kind of film you watch in one breath, and it keeps you right on the edge of your seat. Telling the story of a young Indian Muslim woman who follows her father's footsteps to become a spy by marrying into a Pakistani army family during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, Raazi is a gripping, taut thriller. The script is excellently written, infused with great detail and a fascinating glimpse into the complexity of the relationship between the two nations. The entire espionage track is handled with mastery and is only benefitted from the unpredictable proceedings, keeping the viewers hooked all through.Raazi breaks the paradigm of heroes and villains in the name of communal strife. The film highlights the characters as real people and makes sure to never glorify or demonise one side or the other based just on their nationality. The main protagonist, Sehmat, could be seen in either a positive or negative light depending on the personal stand of a given audience on the subject, and never are we explicitly encouraged to take sides. Are her actions moral? Is she a good person? All these questions are left to the viewer's conclusions, and opinions might be varied, but the human effect is always there, and setsting it apart from other gripping but shallow spy thrillers.Meghna Gulzar, herself the daughter of one of India's prime poets and film directors, does a fantastic job with Raazi both as a thriller and as the human story it ends up being. On all technical accounts, the film is excellent, be it the setting, the cinematography, or the music, but its dramatic urgency is equally as meaningful. Through its extraordinary story, Raazi lets the viewers contemplate on the concept of nationalism, which might tread a fine line between patriotism as in positive national pride and love of one's homeland, and then just pure jingoism. Some may say it advocates for pacifism, but we never know what it actually intends to convey.The acting is just fine by one and all and, needless to say, it is Alia Bhatt who the film belongs to. The role of Sehmat, a woman who is on a mission which places her under constant pressure, is a challenge to any actress, and a young and pretty Bhatt really looks the part by virtue of her unassuming and trustworthy appearance. She is efficiently delicate all through, even phenomenal in some hard-hitting scenes, and although there are weaker moments here and there, her lack of experience turns out beneficial to her portrayal, particularly in view of Sehmat's blend of determination and inner conflict.Vicky Kaushal, just like in real life, seems like a perfectly decent young man, one it's almost impossible to ascribe negative action or malice to. It's another case of a great casting choice, and he is just always so easy to like and sympathise with in a wonderfully understated performance. It goes without saying that it is his character that we end up feeling the most for. These two work well together, and even despite the minimal importance their romantic equation is given in this tense, political thriller, it manages to leave an ultimate mark. Do watch this absorbing film to see how it concludes.",brilliantly written executed film works both as taut spy thriller affecting human story,meghna gulzars raazi is kind film you watch one breath it keeps you right edge your seat telling story young indian muslim woman who follows her fathers footsteps become spy by marrying into pakistani army family during 1971 indo pakistan war raazi is gripping taut thriller script is excellently written infused with great detail fascinating glimpse into complexity relationship between two nations entire espionage track is handled with mastery is only benefitted unpredictable proceedings keeping viewers hooked all through raazi breaks paradigm heroes villains name communal strife film highlights characters as real people makes sure never glorify or demonise one side or other based just their nationality main protagonist sehmat could be seen either positive or negative light depending personal stand given audience subject never are we explicitly encouraged take sides are her actions moral is she good person all these questions are left viewers conclusions opinions might be varied but human effect is always there setsting it apart other gripping but shallow spy thrillers meghna gulzar herself daughter one indias prime poets film directors does fantastic job with raazi both as thriller as human story it ends up being all technical accounts film is excellent be it setting cinematography or music but its dramatic urgency is equally as meaningful through its extraordinary story raazi lets viewers contemplate concept nationalism which might tread fine line between patriotism as positive national pride love ones homeland then just pure jingoism some may say it advocates pacifism but we never know what it actually intends convey acting is just fine by one all needless say it is alia bhatt who film belongs role sehmat woman who is mission which places her under constant pressure is challenge any actress young pretty bhatt really looks part by virtue her unassuming trustworthy appearance she is efficiently delicate all through even phenomenal some hard hitting scenes although there are weaker moments here there her lack experience turns out beneficial her portrayal particularly view sehmats blend determination inner conflict vicky kaushal just like real life seems like perfectly decent young man one its almost impossible ascribe negative action or malice its another case great casting choice he is just always so easy like sympathise with wonderfully understated performance it goes without saying that it is his character that we end up feeling most these two work well together even despite minimal importance their romantic equation is given this tense political thriller it manages leave ultimate mark do watch this absorbing film see how it concludes,0.5600320431202785,0.17886586452762918,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"

9,Meghna+Alia+Vicky = A Must Watch. (Ae Watan song is superb!),"Based on an incredible true story, Raazi is a tribute to unknown heroes of our nation in war time zone. Directed by Meghna Gulzar, who had directed extremely well movie- Talvar in past, this film tells a story about a normal and simple Indian girl, and her journey from being a daughter to a wife and to a spy. One more factor is also there, but am not revealing now because you will get it at the end.Alia Bhatt plays a character of Sehmat, who is an Indian spy married to a Pakistani military officer (Vicky Kaushal) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 on the order of her father. Would she get success to pass on information from Pakistan to India without getting caught and to help Indian forces to stop the war or fight back to Pakistan.... For that go and watch Raazi.It is an adaptation of Harinder Sikka's novel 'Calling Sehmat'. Screenplay has been written by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. Dialogues are written by Meghna. Some dialogues are outstanding. 'Watan Ke Aage Kuch Nahi, Khud Bhi Nahi... Mohabbat Bhi Nahi!' One more is there, when one is declaring about his cancer, he says that- 'Smoking To Ki Nahi Kabhi... Magar Shayad Zindagi ke Kash Thode Lambe Le Liye...!' What a line man! Only a daughter of a great poet can write such!Alia Bhatt has delivered another award winning performance. Till now in this year, she is the deserving one. First time you will see her crying. Especially, in that scene where she is asking his officer about how to balance between life, emotions and duty in war, because it is the toughest one. VIcky Kaushal is as usaul superb. He has less dialogues, but his silences speak more. The gun scene with Alia is the best scene of these two actors. Jaideep Ahlawat has done commendable job. He is always good. But this time he is on another level. Along with Rajit Kapur and Soni Razdan, rest are good, too.Lyrics by Gulzar Saheb and Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Dilbaro is pure Kashmiri folk song on the perfect situation of marriage saying- 'Mudke Na Dekho Dilbaro!' Raazi title track is engaging. Whenever Arijit's voice starts in the hall, some magic happens everytime in this film. School annual function song by Sunidhi and the same song in Arijit Singh's voice - 'Ae Watan'- is the best song that Gulzar Saheb can give us in this decade. What a melody man! Looks like a classic old hindi film tune. For the film situated in 1971, this is the best patriotic song one can ever make! I am so proud of this song... 'Main Jahan Rahun Jahaan Mein Yaad Rahe Tu, Ae Watan... Mere Watan!'I knew that this film would be superb. But this song has uplifted it more. But the same time, it's touching the deepest portion of heart. Human is very complicated creature. Human is not a robot. For anyone, it is hard to be a robot. One can try one's best, but one can't delete the function of emotions from the body. Without emotions, there is no living. Salute to those heroes who are living without emotions so that millions of people from their countries can live happily! If a girl can go to this level for her father and her nation, what can you or I do at current position! The question is unanswered by me. I am still thinking (while writing as well!) The more I think of it, the more I am getting deeper in the thought. The story of a courageous girl is definitely a Must Watch. You'll feel proud of such unsung heroes of your country. Feel the emotions of them. Feel the tension of espionage. Feel the heat of war. As they say- In the War, nothing is important than War, neither you, nor me!",meghna alia vicky must watch ae watan song is superb,based incredible true story raazi is tribute unknown heroes our nation war time zone directed by meghna gulzar who had directed extremely well movie talvar past this film tells story about normal simple indian girl her journey being daughter wife spy one more factor is also there but am not revealing now because you will get it at end alia bhatt plays character sehmat who is indian spy married pakistani military officer vicky kaushal during indo pakistani war 1971 order her father would she get success pass information pakistan india without getting caught help indian forces stop war or fight back pakistan that go watch raazi it is adaptation harinder sikkas novel calling sehmat screenplay has been written by meghna bhavani iyer dialogues are written by meghna some dialogues are outstanding watan ke aage kuch nahi khud bhi nahi mohabbat bhi nahi one more is there when one is declaring about his cancer he says that smoking ki nahi kabhi magar shayad zindagi ke kash thode lambe le liye what line man only daughter great poet can write such alia bhatt has delivered another award winning performance till now this year she is deserving one first time you will see her crying especially that scene where she is asking his officer about how balance between life emotions duty war because it is toughest one vicky kaushal is as usaul superb he has less dialogues but his silences speak more gun scene with alia is best scene these two actors jaideep ahlawat has done commendable job he is always good but this time he is another level along with rajit kapur soni razdan rest are good too lyrics by gulzar saheb music by shankar ehsaan loy dilbaro is pure kashmiri folk song perfect situation marriage saying mudke na dekho dilbaro raazi title track is engaging whenever arijits voice starts hall some magic happens everytime this film school annual function song by sunidhi same song arijit singhs voice ae watan is best song that gulzar saheb can give us this decade what melody man looks like classic old hindi film tune film situated 1971 this is best patriotic song one can ever make i am so proud this song main jahan rahun jahaan mein yaad rahe tu ae watan mere watan i knew that this film would be superb but this song has uplifted it more but same time its touching deepest portion heart human is very complicated creature human is not robot anyone it is hard be robot one can try ones best but one cant delete function emotions body without emotions there is no living salute those heroes who are living without emotions so that millions people their countries can live happily if girl can go this level her father her nation what can you or i do at current position question is unanswered by me i am still thinking while writing as well more i think it more i am getting deeper thought story courageous girl is definitely must watch youll feel proud such unsung heroes your country feel emotions them feel tension espionage feel heat war as they say war nothing is important than war neither you nor me,0.5470634920634921,0.3250108225108225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10,Brutal all the way! Bollywood at its best.,"A great movie! What's surprising is, Raazi doesn't dwell into traditional bollywood subplots. It doesn't have any dance numbers, nor does it have any melodramatic romance. It stays true to what it sets out to do right from the beginning. The lead actor Alia Bhatt manages to get into skin of the character so comfortably that you forget that you are watching a movie, instead you feel the pain she is emoting. What is brilliant about the film is that you keep expecting that every scene is leading you to a traditional Indo-Pak friendship kind of an ending with a stong social message. But what astonishes here is that the movie manages to remain a BRUTAL story of spy carrying out its mission through out. An out and out hardcore spy thriller with a women protagonist, so beautifully crafted that you are left spellbound. Meghna Gulzar captures the simplicity of characters with so much depth that you are bound to sympathize with every character. Take a bow!All actors are at par. Direction is superb.

7,Long Review: Raazi (7 Stars),"If you look at director Meghna Gulzar's filmography, you will find that she has a penchant for two things: the unknown and the suspense. While her Talvar (2015) was a brilliant ode to the concept of ""trial by media"", her latest feature Raazi is a subtle picturisation of modern, stealth-based espionage. The likes you experience in today's video gaming world and which reminded me of IO Interactive's phenomenal Hitman (2016).It is the 1970s. Alia Bhatt plays Sehmat, the charming and courageous daughter of an Indian businessman Hidayat (Rajit Kapur) whose side hustle as a superficial spy for the Indian government is also a family business. Sehmat is not too surprised when he tells her that he would like her to extend the family legacy by marrying into a Pakistani army family. The transformation from a petite college student to a rookie yet fiery spy makes Sehmat the heart and soul of Raazi, which manages to narrate an espionage thriller in the most passive way possible.Sehmat's accord to continue the family legacy on the request, rather than the behest, of her father, is arguably the most interesting part of the film. The reason that she gives for her willingness to agree is another point of brilliance that Gulzar succeeds in carving out, giving us all the more confirmation that this is not a typical Bollywood drama. Of course, because there are no high-octane sequences that you would usually anticipate and revel for in a Bollywood film that chronicles the life of a spy. Last time it was done (Ek Tha Tiger (2012)), the spy fell in love and got hitched. But that doesn't mean that Raazi does not entertain. Bhatt leads the play like a diligent student working on a side project that consumes her. In one of her best performances to date, she follows director Gulzar's cues with perfection and coagulates between her college-goer and budding spy airs with absolute finesse. She is the star of the film, shooting delightful sequences at the viewer at every juncture, sufficiently supported by her co-actors.Being married off to a Pakistani army officer (Vicky Kaushal) is not a happening event for Sehmat, but she is inquisitive about the challenges that she has to face on her way as she hobnobs with the who's who of both sides of the warring nations. Co-writers Gulzar and Bhavani Iyer carve a drama that is so subtle you will find that blood is spilled without the use of a dagger and that careers are destroyed and government files are stolen without even the wind knowing it. Such is the power of treatment of the original material, the 2008 widely-unknown book titled Calling Sehmat by Harinder Sikka. One of the many reasons why Sehmat's character connects with the audience is her regular background. There is enough for a family audience to watch, point out, and imbibe in Raazi, much like how it was for Talvar three years ago.Gulzar uses her art of subtlety to chronicle a popular period in a real-life war, but she does seek help from cinematic liberty. For a discerning viewer, it will feel like Sehmat has everything in place for, whether it is conveniently replicating a classified dossier or eavesdropping a high-profile conversation. The audience is smart enough to detect the contrived nature of any plot these days, but that is still only a small part of Raazi, which nevertheless keeps you hooked with a dose of delight at all times.Bhatt, along with her performance in Abhishek Chaubey's Udta Punjab (2016), confirms that she is not just a product of nepotism (a hot topic in Bollywood these days) but is someone with real talent and conviction. Kaushal plays a small part as her on-screen husband with a natural attitude, further helping the film stress on Bhatt's anti-hero character. Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor are the other cast members who put up a good show and carry Raazi to an appealing finish. It is clear that Gulzar put her bets on the cast, the narrative, and her own dialogues, which is why little importance is given to the music and other parameters. Production value is sufficient and introduces realism, while the shots are straightforward without a gymnastic approach that a lot of today's filmmakers are employing in the name of the avant-garde.A thoroughly enjoyable espionage flick that has the right amount of all the requisite ingredients, Raazi succeeds as that rare Bollywood thriller you never saw coming. Watch it while you hang your thinking capabilities for tomorrow's work.

9,Alia's one of the Best Performance!,"Spy movies are a difficult genre to execute ; because of the basic formulas and general assumptions that we normally link with such stuffs! Not all of the people might accept the representation of Patriotism/Nationalism in different kind of ways! In my honest opinion, Not every Spy/Secret Service Agent movie needs to be extravagant. The same events can be told in more subtle or expressive way through a Strong screenplay, story and performance! Raazi is one of them! It does not depend on budget heavy Action sequences nor the usual eye pleasing explosions but rather it solely focuses on the nuance moments that a Spy goes through in his lifetime! The story has its' strengths in the Buildup phase with nail biting tension and suspenseful drama all over till the end. The Background score has done it's job perfectly. The cinematography and editing deserves an Applaud for how beautifully it's being shot! Should they added some Gore/Violence in the plot ; Well It would have completed on all the essential aspects of a Spy Film! Nonetheless a Great film that can be seen or understood by anyone!

4,Nationalism,"Storyline: An Indian view of the India-Pakistan conflict events in 1971. It seems a couple of Hindi movies dealing with Pakistan or (East Pakistan/Bangladesh) and even Kashmir have promoted Indian nationalism and military to a level that nation history has shown can lead to unthinking horrific conflicts. The problem for all nations is that it is often against self interest to encourage an intelligent, unbiased, fact based analysis of why they might pursue an aggressive policy - the pros & cons; the costs & benefits to all parties involved. Nationalism politics is to promote an unthinking, do as you're told, and if you don't you must be an enemy approach.",nationalism,storyline indian view india pakistan conflict events 1971 it seems couple hindi movies dealing with pakistan or east pakistan bangladesh even kashmir have promoted indian nationalism military level that nation history has shown can lead unthinking horrific conflicts problem all nations is that it is often against self interest encourage intelligent unbiased fact based analysis why they might pursue aggressive policy pros cons costs benefits all parties involved nationalism politics is promote unthinking do as youre told if you dont you must be enemy approach,0.6666666666666666,-0.10000000000000002,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.55}"
9,Raazi Review,"Raazi is a film co-written and directed by Meghna Gulzar. The trailers seemed good to me and the ongoing positive reception, both, critically and commercially, compelled me to watch this film. And I can definitely say that this is one of the best of 2018.Plot: Sehmat is married to Iqbal Syed of the Pakistani army, so that she can pass information about Pakistan's actions against India during 1971.Story and direction: This film is adapted from the novel 'Calling Sehmat' by Harinder Sikka. This film has been very beautifully adapted by Meghna and Bhavani Iyer. The writing of the film is spot-on and never is it felt that the story was dragging. The character work of this film is also so intricate and detailed that I was in awe. The film not only showed that how spies work but also put light on the fact as to how difficult is a spy's work mentally. This aspect is highlighted most in this venture which was a risk and I salute Meghna and team for taking that risk. Here the Pakistani's are not shown as the enemies but as humans who would do anything to protect their country. The scenery of Kashmir and Pakistan were very well captured. But I did feel that I could guess some scenes. I am thinking that is just me. The character choices seemed very guessable, which was my only flaw with this film.Performances: Alia Bhatt once again proves that she is a great actress if given a compelling script. From the young college girl to the Indian spy, she played all the roles with ease. Vicky Kaushal was another of the gems of this film. Jaideep Ahlawat was an awesome mentor to Alia's character. Rajit Kapur, Shishir Sharma and Arif Zakaria also provided come great performances.Songs and BGM: This film has only three songs and all of them are good. Gulzar's lyrics and Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music were good. The songs never felt they were there to just fill in gaps. They moved the story forward and provided fuel to such a wonderful story. My favorite was 'Dilbaro'. The BGM felt good to the ears and not irritable as most Indian BGM's sound.Favorite Scene: It would be the one in the beginning where Hidayat tells Sehmat to return to college and resume her studies. But then Sehmat replies that if her father can serve the nation why not her. The kind of maturity seen in that particular scene is what made an impression on my mind and my favourite.Verdict: Meghna Gulzar is proving to be one of the compelling female directors of recent times. First Talvar and now Raazi. This film's different take on a spy genre and Alia's performance make this a must watch. I am going with a 9/10 with this one.",raazi review,raazi is film co written directed by meghna gulzar trailers seemed good me ongoing positive reception both critically commercially compelled me watch this film i can definitely say that this is one best 2018 plot sehmat is married iqbal syed pakistani army so that she can pass information about pakistans actions against india during 1971 story direction this film is adapted novel calling sehmat by harinder sikka this film has been very beautifully adapted by meghna bhavani iyer writing film is spot never is it felt that story was dragging character work this film is also so intricate detailed that i was awe film not only showed that how spies work but also put light fact as how difficult is spys work mentally this aspect is highlighted most this venture which was risk i salute meghna team taking that risk here pakistanis are not shown as enemies but as humans who would do anything protect their country scenery kashmir pakistan were very well captured but i did feel that i could guess some scenes i am thinking that is just me character choices seemed very guessable which was my only flaw with this film performances alia bhatt once again proves that she is great actress if given compelling script young college girl indian spy she played all roles with ease vicky kaushal was another gems this film jaideep ahlawat was awesome mentor alias character rajit kapur shishir sharma arif zakaria also provided come great performances songs bgm this film has only three songs all them are good gulzars lyrics shankar ehsaan loys music were good songs never felt they were there just fill gaps they moved story forward provided fuel such wonderful story my favorite was dilbaro bgm felt good ears not irritable as most indian bgms sound favorite scene it would be one beginning where hidayat tells sehmat return college resume her studies but then sehmat replies that if her father can serve nation why not her kind maturity seen that particular scene is what made impression my mind my favourite verdict meghna gulzar is proving be one compelling female directors recent times first talvar now raazi this films different take spy genre alias performance make this must watch i am going with 9 10 with this one,0.5853535353535353,0.3562548562548562,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"

8,a layered patriotic film with a humanistic approach,"Until the interval, the film was slowly boiling but felt like something was missing. But a powerful scene just before the interval explained the whole film in a go. Sehmat undresses herself after a killing, stands under the shower and cries - the cries crack up the heart. One surrenders to the nation irrespective of the in-depth emotions, until Raazi came up the films relied more on nation. But, Meghna Gulzar proves, Emotion is greater than Nation.The complex nature of the film might come across as a defect, beneath the surface the heart is rapidly beating and the conflicts underline every character. The borders cease to exist, writers Bhavani Iyer and Meghna Gulzar team up to built a strong sense of emotional play. And this is just what I always expected from a war-torn film. The dynamics of ""Ae Watan"" play in context to both the countries, there's no hero or villain - humanity is. Bollywood has often patronised the term ""patriotism"", Raazi steps beyond it by taking up the humanistic approach brilliantly. And then, the following dialogue works as a paradox- ""Watan Ke Aage Kuch Bhi Nahi, Mohabbat Bhi Nahi (there's nothing beyond a nation, not even love)"", says Iqbal Syed.Sehmat played by Alia Bhatt carves into emotion during the shower scene, often her anxiety comes across childish which just stands as a mould.
