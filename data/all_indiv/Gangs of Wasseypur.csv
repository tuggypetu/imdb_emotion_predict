8.0,The movie of the year,"It has been nearly 5 years since I went and saw a movie first day first show in the theatres. But such was the level of anticipation with ""gangs of wasseypur"" that I found myself standing in front of the ticket counter at quarter to nine. The movie, which is 160 minutes long, starts with a shoot-them-up which may be the most authentic shoot-to-kill scene in Hindi cinema. The movie tells the story of rivalries between different sects of Muslims: the butchers, Qureshis, and the Pathans, Khans and extend over a period of three generations. The story starts from the pre- independence era when the British owned the mines in Dhanbad. After independence, these mines pass on to the wealthy landlord who hires an exiled Pathan to act as his strongman. The pathan, the father of Sardar Khan (Manoj Vajpayee) has been kicked out of his village, Wasseypur, after a confrontation with the local musclemen, the Qureshis, and is now forced to work in the mines of Dhanbad. He starts becoming too big for his shoes and is bumped off by the landlord thus beginning a series of killings and counter-killings. The acting by the ""star"" cast is stunning with Manoj Vajpayee leading the pack in as good as a performance as ""Bheeku Mahatre"" in Satya. When he stares lustfully at the back side of Reema Sen (here resurrected after being in the wilderness for nearly half a dozen years), you can feel the lust as a physical thing. He is backed by a very strong ensemble cast. The real strength of the movie is its dialogues. The words, replete with the choicest of abuses, feel as if they were wiretapped. The conversation rings true to life and had me laughing at the sheer vulgarity of it. The patois is captured very faithfully. The only negative point about the movie is its length which could have been edited somewhat in the second half when the third generation takes up (like the long Godfather III, if you may). Anurag Kashyap has put his soul into the movie and that is visible from every frame of the movie. The direction is the best I have seen this year in Hindi cinema and will only increase the expectations from the second part of this opus. And that is why I am jealous of the lucky bastards at the Cannes film festival who got to see both the parts back to back. The movie ends at a tantalizing junction and the prospect of meeting with these barely lovable characters for a second outing left me salivating.",movie year,it has been nearly 5 years since i went saw movie first day first show theatres but such was level anticipation with gangs wasseypur that i found myself standing front ticket counter at quarter nine movie which is 160 minutes long starts with shoot them up which may be most authentic shoot kill scene hindi cinema movie tells story rivalries between different sects muslims butchers qureshis pathans khans extend over period three generations story starts pre independence era when british owned mines dhanbad after independence these mines pass wealthy landlord who hires exiled pathan act as his strongman pathan father sardar khan manoj vajpayee has been kicked out his village wasseypur after confrontation with local musclemen qureshis is now forced work mines dhanbad he starts becoming too big his shoes is bumped off by landlord thus beginning series killings counter killings acting by star cast is stunning with manoj vajpayee leading pack as good as performance as bheeku mahatre satya when he stares lustfully at back side reema sen here resurrected after being wilderness nearly half dozen years you can feel lust as physical thing he is backed by very strong ensemble cast real strength movie is its dialogues words replete with choicest abuses feel as if they were wiretapped conversation rings true life had me laughing at sheer vulgarity it patois is captured very faithfully only negative point about movie is its length which could have been edited somewhat second half when third generation takes up like long godfather iii if you may anurag kashyap has put his soul into movie that is visible every frame movie direction is best i have seen this year hindi cinema will only increase expectations second part this opus that is why i am jealous lucky bastards at cannes film festival who got see both parts back back movie ends at tantalizing junction prospect meeting with these barely lovable characters second outing left me salivating,0.3857380952380953,0.14658333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Masterpiece!!,"I have just returned from the first day late night show of this movie (the first part) and it has totally blown me away. The movie starts with a bang and carries the charm throughout. The way each character is introduced is terrific. It is story telling at its best. From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie.Siddiqui's role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good.Apart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers.The camera angles, especially the final sequence is superb. Anurag Kashyap is India's answer to Quentin Terentino. Gangs of Waseypur is already a Cult.",masterpiece,i have just returned first day late night show this movie first part it has totally blown me away movie starts with bang carries charm throughout way each character is introduced is terrific it is story telling at its best shahid khan sardar khan sultan you actually end up fearing them all characters are so beautifully portrayed manoj bajpai is amazing as sardar he really got into character narration by one gang members adds lot flavor entire flow movie siddiquis role is brief first part i have feeling he will play major role remaining part this epic he is already looking good tigmanshu as ramadheer singh is terrific his expressions too good apart this movie is informative it very subtly tells audience all about way indian coal mafia has progressed over years gang wars politics obviously there is lot slang i have not seen hindi movie with so crude language ever absolutely not recommended family viewing children teenagers camera angles especially final sequence is superb anurag kashyap is indias answer quentin terentino gangs waseypur is already cult,0.623263888888889,0.18454861111111112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,A chronicle about Sinister fraternity of the Crime from the eyes of Anurag Kashyap,"An epic tale about loyalty, crime, lust, treachery and vendetta. A cinematic magnum opus.Set in Dhanbaad's(Jharkhand)Village, called Wasseypur, ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" starts with our very own ""Kyunki Saas bhi bahu thi"" and goes beyond the cinematic ethics. A saga which has all the ingredients of a cult cinema like black humor, full mouthed characters, adultery, bullets,vengeance and everything you expect in a film by Anurag Kashyap.En route to end of British Raj in India, Shahid Khan, a dacoit, loots the British trains, masquerading as Sultana Daku, is shot dead by Ramadhir Singh's goon. Shahid's son, Sardar Khan, pledges to avenge his father's death and shaves his head. He becomes one of the most notorious gangsters of Wasseypur. The film reconnoiters his connections with power, politics and fraternity of crime. There is a clash between two Muslim groups Pathans and Qureshis, about their covetousness for glory and money.Manoj Bajpai gives an impeccable performance as a violent and lecherous man. It is one of the powerhouse acts, we will ever encounter. The real find of the decade is Tigmanshu Dhuila a well-known cult director (Hassil, Paan Singh Tomar, Saheb Biwi aur Gangster etc), who embodied the character as if he himself is Ramdhir Singh.Richa Chadda is believable as Sardar Khan's anxious and bold wife. Reema Sen is good as a silent and steamy concubine of Sardar Khan.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a born thespian; he is believable as weed smoking, Amitabh's die-hard fan and black sheep of the family. We have already witnessed him in ""Kahaani"" and ""Peepli live"". I think he is one of the most underrated actors, has now got an opportunity to flaunt himself in GOW II(I saw the trailer of Part II after the credit rolled).Rest of the cast Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Huma Quershi(debut-She looks ravishing while persuading the theater's security guard for the second show of the movie ""Trishul"") and others are so authentic that you will easily relate the characters with North India (Bihar), the dialects, the dialogue delivery, the expressions are genuine.The music by Sneha Khanwalkar is down to earth, a triumph, it has the rustic soul and is very unique. One can understand the geniuses by listening the beats and lyrics. Some of them are folks sung by the locals.And after all it's Anurag Kashyap ,who can go to any length to enhance the quality of Indian Cinema. Undoubtedly it has been screened in Cannes,and people watched the entire saga (a delirious 5 Hours 20 Minutes run time) and lauded with the accolades.

8.0,‎'Gangs of Wasseypur' is a visceral epic!,"‎'Gangs of Wasseypur' is a visceral epic! Not the kind of regular rubbish that is churned out every now and then. Mr.Anurag Kashyap has brought us something that can be categorized with the likes of 'The Godfather'.Manoj Bajpayee is rocking and superbly supported by a fabulous Richa Chadda, Reema Sen and Piyush Mishra. And final cherry on the acting caked is Nawazzuddin as a vulnerable young lad who is basically a romantic at heart but is getting transformed into a ruthless gangster much like Michael Corleone in the Godfather series. Manoj Bajpayee's character is quite akin to much more ruthless version of Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather'.By repeatingly mentioning 'The Godfather' I am not trying to take away anything from GOW. GOW is a superb film which needs to be watched by anyone and everyone who has the slightest of respect and love for films and filmmaking.Sneha Khawalker's rockingtingly superb music brings a whole new level of excitement in the film and Rajeev Ravi's cinematography is very very efficient, sprinkled with quite a few shots of sheer brilliance.All this make a nice, superbly tasty biryani and the credit can only go the masterchef Mr.Anurag Kashyap.8/10, and I'd defo recommend all my friends to go and watch this film in CINEMAS!",gangs wasseypur is visceral epic,gangs wasseypur is visceral epic not kind regular rubbish that is churned out every now then mr anurag kashyap has brought us something that can be categorized with likes godfather manoj bajpayee is rocking superbly supported by fabulous richa chadda reema sen piyush mishra final cherry acting caked is nawazzuddin as vulnerable young lad who is basically romantic at heart but is getting transformed into ruthless gangster much like michael corleone godfather series manoj bajpayees character is quite akin much more ruthless version don vito corleone played by marlon brando godfather by repeatingly mentioning godfather i am not trying take away anything gow gow is superb film which needs be watched by anyone everyone who has slightest respect love films filmmaking sneha khawalkers rockingtingly superb music brings whole new level excitement film rajeev ravis cinematography is very very efficient sprinkled with quite few shots sheer brilliance all this make nice superbly tasty biryani credit can only go masterchef mr anurag kashyap 8 10 id defo recommend all my friends go watch this film cinemas,0.6373641742872512,0.15755244755244752,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"

The story spans last seven decades of Indian history with events taking place in mining towns of Wasseypur and Dhanbad. The tale of the cities is portrayed in the rivalry between the family of Shahid Khan,an ambitious man who loots trains in British Era by the name of Sultana Daku and Ramdahri Singh and Local Contractor turned Politician. The animosity is passed to the next generation where Sardar Khan portrayed by Manoj Bajpai,who wants to avenge his fathers death by destroying Ramdhari Singh and his family and the Qureshi's who outcast his father. Manoj Bajpai has outclassed himself. Every single actor has done his part perfectly. You will feel like you are actually living in that part of the world.

9.0,A riveting drama spanning decades,"One of the most awaited movies of the year, the first part of Gangs of Wasseypur lives up to expectations. However, the only disappointing aspect of the movie is that one has to wait for the part two of the movie to see how the story unfolds. The movie is based at Wasseypur and other surrounding areas of Dhanbad. The time-line of the movie spans from early 1940s to early 1990s. The second part of the movie is expected to span from early 1990s to mid 2000s. It's a story of Pathans Shahid Khan (played by Jaideep Ahlawat)and his son Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpayee, Qureshis, and politician-cum-coal mine owner-cum- local don Ramadheer Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia)and his son. The tussle between Pathans and Qureshis, and that between Shahid Khan and Sardar Khan on one side and Ramadheer Singh and his son on the other side are the highlights of the movie. In between, one also sees different facets of coal mafia, revenge, rivalries among Muslims, and even love stories too. The movie is intense, gripping, and has a fair sprinkling of cuss words one finds in Bihar and Jharkhand, where the film is based. The music of the film is another highlight, and one needs to watch the film to fully realize the relevance of songs in the film. In short: a must- watch movie for those who love hard hitting movies with great acting from all the actors.",riveting drama spanning decades,one most awaited movies year first part gangs wasseypur lives up expectations however only disappointing aspect movie is that one has wait part two movie see how story unfolds movie is based at wasseypur other surrounding areas dhanbad time line movie spans early 1940s early 1990s second part movie is expected span early 1990s mid 2000s its story pathans shahid khan played by jaideep ahlawat his son sardar khan manoj bajpayee qureshis politician cum coal mine owner cum local don ramadheer singh tigmanshu dhulia his son tussle between pathans qureshis that between shahid khan sardar khan one side ramadheer singh his son other side are highlights movie between one also sees different facets coal mafia revenge rivalries among muslims even love stories too movie is intense gripping has fair sprinkling cuss words one finds bihar jharkhand where film is based music film is another highlight one needs watch film fully realize relevance songs film short must watch movie those who love hard hitting movies with great acting all actors,0.4947916666666666,0.14618055555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.22}"

9.0,The Solitary Epic of Indian Cinema.,"Premiering at Cannes, this was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Maybe not for the Multiplex going, entertainment seeking audience but for people who actually care for gritty cinema. I, personally, have always been a fan of Anurag Kashyap, Manoj Bajpayee as well as Piyush Mishra. So, for me this movie was like cinematic heaven, before it even started.It is a story unfolding through generations in Wasseypur, Jharkhand(erstwhile Bihar). It starts with Sahid Khan( played brilliantly by Jaideep Ahlawat), who robs trains by the pseudonym of Sultana Daku which is in fact the pseudonym of another Dacoit that lives in the village. So, on one such attempt, the original Sultana Daku kills of Sahid Khan's gang and throws him out of Wasseypur. Thus starts the rivalry of the Khans and the Qureshis. Sahid Khan moves to Dhanbad where he leaves this life of robbery behind him and starts working in a field mine. During child birth, his wife dies while he was unable to reach her in time because he wasn't informed by the authorities. The son grows up over the years and India soon wins independence. With Independence, the British abandon the mines which are soon given to a Jamindar, Ramadhir Singh. He needs Pahalwans(bouncers) to run the mines and keep the workers in control, so he hires Sahid Khan. What Ramadhir Singh did not foresee was that Sahid Khan himself wanted the throne all for himself. When Ramadhir Singh finds out, he sends Sahid for a job at Banaras where Sahid Khan is assassinated. He also tries to kill Sahid's younger brother and son but they escape. The kid grows up to be Sardar Khan( Manoj Bajpayee) whose only aim in life is revenge against Ramadhir Singh, the guy who killed his father. ""Goli Nahi Maarenge Usko, Keh Ke Lenge Uski"".I won't say that if i continue with the story, it'll give the movie away but the thing is every twist and turn of the story, every little detail, Anurag Kashyap wants you to explore for yourself. There are so many characters and so many stories that it becomes more of an epic than a movies. With Piyush Mishra's narration, the movie unfolds smoothly as you will keep watching dumbstruck at the crime and the 'bakaiti'. The usage of slang is in abundance. Definitely, not a movie that you can watch with your family, or even girlfriend, for that matter. Brilliant performances, a brilliant script, and wonderful direction leaves you expecting for more.

10.0,A Nutshell Review: Gangs of Wasseypur,"Co-written and directed by Anurag Kashyap, this film will probably propel the filmmaker into the ranks occupied by the likes of Coppola and Scorsese in crafting Mafia styled epics, filled with the themes of brotherhood, revenge, betrayal, sex and violence. Showcased at this year's Cannes Directors' Fortnight with its sequel screened back to back, Kashyap has brought forth a sprawling, three generation span long tale of the titular Gangs of the coal mining town, where three crime families engage one another for infamy, riches and power supremacy.And what he had done to provide some gravitas to this tale, was a semi-documentary look at its background against the town of Wasseypur, where we witness how the wheelings and dealings between shady businessmen and their workers, and how some become politicians through bullying, gangster tactics, the laundering of money, and eventually buying support to ascend the political ladder. It's an intriguing commentary about, by extension, the country's state of affairs, and how some can grow influence through the use of hired muscles out to do their dirty work, for the duration of their useful lifespan, before being discarded.Beginning in explosive fashion with a full assault on a property, key figures get introduced, but only to keep things under wraps until the companion film in Part 2. We then get brought back to the 40s Wasseypur and Dhanbad land, where the British found themselves up against the formidable forces of the Qureshis , only for Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat) to impersonate their mysterious leader, pre-empt their attacks and undercut the Qureshis in their own game. Soon the Khans got exiled, only for Shahid to be brought back to Wasseypur when Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia), a rich, corrupt industrialist, needed a muscle man to help in his exploitation of workers. But jealously meant Ramandhir's orders to get rid of Shahid, and thus opening up the feud to the second generation, led by Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai) who is hell bent on revenge.But in a tragi-comedy sort of way, the character of Sardar is somewhat tough on the outside with his ruthlessness, but all soft and fuzzy inside with his libido being lacking in control, with first wife Nagma (Richa Chadda) being relatively tolerant of his gallivanting ways only because she gets pregnant too easily, and the introduction of a Bengali girl Durga (Reema Sen) whom he met while on the run. This sets up the third generation of cast with Sardar's sons Danish (Vineet Singh) and Faizal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), with a hint on what's to come disrupt his family dynamics with illegitimate son Definite, entering the picture, whom we'll see more of in the next film whose trailer gets airtime right after the end credits. On the other corner are the heir of the Qureshis in Ehsaan (Vipin Sharma) and Sultan (Pankaj Tripathy), who are caught in the middle with their alliance with Ramandhir, and the marriage of Sultan's sister Sharma (Amirota Jha). And what makes it interesting in the entire male dominated world, is the story of the women behind the men, as seen from the major character arcs on Sardar's family involved in romance of some sort, playing critical roles in defining the male characters and contrasting them in both their private and public lives, and instrumental especially in the final scene, and going into the next film.It might be overwhelming at first with a myriad of characters being introduced, but Kashyap got his presentation all under control like an old hand, bringing on new characters with proper title flashes, and providing adequate screen time for each to establish his or her backstory. This wonderfully crafts out motivations and characteristics of each family member, especially between the sons of Sardar, who will all play pivotal roles in the sequel, since the very first scene here would have shown each of them under different camps, and teasing us with just how allegiances would play out with family members now standing under different banners. Part of the engagement now would be to develop the narrative to reach the inevitable, and with the ensemble set up, the possibilities are endless.And as such, Gangs of Wasseypur has its fair share of surprises thrown about, where those slighted will almost always come back with a vengeance. Revenge may be high on Sardar's agenda, but there's a permeating poetic justice that provides a cruel twist of irony, with the narrative rich enough to allow various subplots to populate the story and to add a vivid texture to the characters instead of letting them become one dimensional characters.

6.0,"Epic, badlands kind of film","""Then there was the whole concept of coal mining, which is a culture unto itself, the most dangerous occupation in the world, and which draws and develops a certain kind of man."" Martin C. SmithManoj Bajpai wants revenge on Tigmanshu Dhulia who had treacherously killed his father. Sometimes there comes a story which has an epic kind of sweep. Spanning generations, introducing several characters, all caught up in empire building, love, lust and enimity. There isn't much point to them, the protagonists aren't clearly defined, the storyline meandering, their lives entwined in the events that befell the nation and the small town that the story inhabits. Set in the backdrop of Wasseypur, a small part of Dhanbad, capital of India's coal belt, numerous characters come and go. India gains independence, Emergency is imposed, coal mining is first unionized and later nationalized. However, the story, at its core remains about Tigmanshu's star rising ever higher and Manoj building his own empire from humble origins, while seeking revenge.There are times when you wish things would happen quicker. That there were less characters. Or that there was a point to some of them, who are introduced to either only die or shine bright for a few frames before being forgotten. The environment is beautifully captured, including the lingo, the mannerisms whether it's the abject despair of the poor mine worker, condemned to live his life in the black shafts. The bestiality of the butcher, as he hacks away at his meat. The cowardice of the cops. The empty bravado of the minister's goons. Or the naked lust as hungry men eye their next catch, the woman to slake their base desires, even as the wife lies at home, pregnant. However, there are several things which let the film down. For a film set in the coal belt, we see very little of it. Apart from one memorable scene where, caked in the black coaldust, a few men fight for their lives and another where coals water absorption properties are highlighted, there is too little was about the black mineral and much more made of ancillary businesses. National events of importance are also given short shrift or brushed over, their impact shown quickly, transitions happening smoothly rather than in real life where each change creates havoc in such a tiny eco-system. Great camera work, flawless performances, several one-liners and very catchy music keep you engaged, though, as our two key protagonists slug it out and religion comes in, with different sects of Muslims engaging in war amongst each other. The story moves forward with a Godfather-esque gait, a kind of glacial majesty, in stops and starts, not always making sense.

7.0,"""Here, even a pigeon flies with one wing, and uses the other to guard his innocence.""","The movie takes place in Dhanabad, a district of Jharkand in India, and is a fictionalized account of real events. Spanning generations as it does, it perhaps carries greater resonance for Hindi film goers than a Western audience. I found it difficult to relate to the characters and situations, and didn't get a sense of epic adventure that other reviewers on this board seem to express. Certainly not as it relates to the nearly five and a half hours required to tell it's story. One notable difference I noticed from other Indian movies was the unnecessary reliance on musical sequences of any kind, which for a film like this would probably have been inappropriate anyway. Be that as it may, I would have appreciated a shorter film, and since it relies on characteristics of The Godfather Saga, might have better served as a movie with a sequel or two.",here even pigeon flies with one wing uses other guard his innocence,movie takes place dhanabad district jharkand india is fictionalized account real events spanning generations as it does it perhaps carries greater resonance hindi film goers than western audience i found it difficult relate characters situations didnt get sense epic adventure that other reviewers this board seem express certainly not as it relates nearly five half hours required tell its story one notable difference i noticed other indian movies was unnecessary reliance musical sequences any kind which film like this would probably have been inappropriate anyway be that as it may i would have appreciated shorter film since it relies characteristics godfather saga might have better served as movie with sequel or two,0.4331232492997199,0.06771708683473389,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.55}"
4.0,I nodded off a few times...,"I didn't get it!What I did get is that this movie is considered a masterpiece of Hindi cinema, and total respect for that, and the nods to certain scenes in The Godfather and the Al Pacino lookalike, yeah I got that, and some of the interspersed Bollywood-style music renditions were enjoyable and added depth, and I also managed to get through the whole movie in one sitting, which is also good (but I really wanted to quit).What I don't understand is how this movie can be rated higher (8.2) than Blade Runner, for example? It was difficult to follow, had rushed scenes that continued to ramble on with no discernible plot, lots of shaky and close-up camera work and just a general out of date and old fashioned feel to it. What gives? Who are the people rating this so highly? Have Bollywood ratings merged with westernized film ratings? What am I missing?I am looking at the awards page right now and they are mostly Asia-specific awards from 2013, which explains its popularity, but I wish I had been aware of how region-specific this movie was before watching it instead of it being bundled into the IMDB Top 250 due to its high rating. I'm a big fan of foreign language (non-English) films, which are often so refreshing in comparison to the standard Hollywood fare, but this movie felt very under-produced and difficult to follow.I also don't understand why the runtime is listed at 5h 21mins, whereas the movie that I just watched was 2h 40mins, which also maybe explains why the movie felt so disjointed and hard to grasp? And the 2h 40mins version felt like an eternity anyway, although it did hold my attention in places.As a further sense of over-dramatization and bad implementation, take the final scene in which the kingpin gets surrounded at the gas station, Godfather-esque, and shot down in a hail of bullets, who somehow, miraculously gets up with visible bullet holes in his head to stumble off to die. It doesn't happen like that - he's dead and that's the end - which is further indication of the amateurish missteps I encountered in this movie.I certainly didn't hate it, but minor things like excessive machismo and violence on the one hand, but squeamish attitudes towards sex on the other, emphasize how un-western this movie is and how it should have been flagged as a Bollywood/Hindi-specific experience.",i nodded off few times,i didnt get it what i did get is that this movie is considered masterpiece hindi cinema total respect that nods certain scenes godfather al pacino lookalike yeah i got that some interspersed bollywood style music renditions were enjoyable added depth i also managed get through whole movie one sitting which is also good but i really wanted quit what i dont understand is how this movie can be rated higher 8 2 than blade runner example it was difficult follow had rushed scenes that continued ramble with no discernible plot lots shaky close up camera work just general out date old fashioned feel it what gives who are people rating this so highly have bollywood ratings merged with westernized film ratings what am i missing i am looking at awards page right now they are mostly asia specific awards 2013 which explains its popularity but i wish i had been aware how region specific this movie was before watching it instead it being bundled into imdb top 250 due its high rating im big fan foreign language non english films which are often so refreshing comparison standard hollywood fare but this movie felt very under produced difficult follow i also dont understand why runtime is listed at 5h 21mins whereas movie that i just watched was 2h 40mins which also maybe explains why movie felt so disjointed hard grasp 2h 40mins version felt like eternity anyway although it did hold my attention places as further sense over dramatization bad implementation take final scene which kingpin gets surrounded at gas station godfather esque shot down hail bullets who somehow miraculously gets up with visible bullet holes his head stumble off die it doesnt happen like that hes dead thats end which is further indication amateurish missteps i encountered this movie i certainly didnt hate it but minor things like excessive machismo violence one hand but squeamish attitudes towards sex other emphasize how un western this movie is how it should have been flagged as bollywood hindi specific experience,0.44346208112874774,-0.00047266313932979126,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.37}"

6.0,My Anticipation Levels were too darn high!,"""Gangs of Wasseypur"" has been a forerunner in Crime Thrillers since early 2010s. It flaunts enough intrepidity with violent stuffs. Nevertheless it totters due to a sparse narration, therefore a prolonged screenplay adds up to its ambiguity!Amidst a profusion of talents on board; the narrative style eradicates its adeptness. Therefore failing to compliment an authentic art direction. Cinematography & the Ambience being set in correlation with realism bearing fruitful results In storytelling. Presentation is ethereal with memorable dialogues glazed by witty humour. Soundtrack takes an unconventional yet interesting route which may have polarizing point of views.Performances are extraordinaire. And why it wouldn't be? Just take a peek at the ensembled cast, carefully assembled by Mr. Kashyap. Jaydeep Ahlawat, Pankaj Tripathi, Manoj Bajpayee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Richa Chadda, Vineet Kumar, Huma Qureshi. Today, each one of them having their own shows; enduringly proves Anurag's prowess as a talent spotter.Despite with a plethora of positives, Some facets of the execution are off putting. A tedious runtime with disheveled narration confusing me several times. The timelines being mentioned in here aren't properly coordinated. Handling all the different characters with same importance & value isn't an easy task. The writing here definitely lacks in that aspect as well. The story shines the brightest in high octane moments. Likewise delivering a relatively pallid outcome regarding romantic Interests and dramatic portions.In conclusion, I had too much expectations going in. It doesn't absolutely disappoint but I had definitely hoped for more.

6.0,"Watch it for its execution, performances, music and dialogues BUT don't expect something fresh in its story content.","GANGS OF WASSEYPUR also tries to walk on that thin line between the meaningful and entertaining cinema which in fact turns out to be a worth watching project due to its execution, performances, music and dialogues, but at the same time doesn't has anything fresh to offer in terms of concept, storyline or script. Following the path already discovered in Hindi Cinema by Ram Gopal Varma in his Rakt Charitra Part 1 & Part 2 releasing in the gap of two months, Anurag decides to go the same way with his GOW Part 1 & 2. But for some undisclosed reasons he doesn't mention this two part film in GOW's posters or promotion as was boldly done by RGV. Anurag's films have always been region based projects featuring subjects revolving around cities like Mumbai, Rajasthan, Punjab and more. So following the same trend, this time he takes us to a rather lesser known region of Wasseypur (Dhanbad) and its coal mine industry dealing in gang wars. The film gives you no time to settle down and simply starts off with a long bloody sequence of guns, murders and bloodshed. But then it takes too much time of almost 40 minutes to tell you the background of the story and the lead actors enter the screen only after this initial hiccup. The first half mainly deals with defining the basis of all the rivalry going on with small references of the Coal-mining history starting from the British era. Thankfully, the director comes into his form post intermission and gives you many more striking sequences which are surely not for the faint hearted. There are more brutal murders and the deadly gang wars continue till the next generation which somehow also gives you a feeling of being repetitive. Further, the length of close to 3 hours leads to a little restlessness as it moves towards the climax. But 3 things truly save the film despite of having all the routine content as far as the storyline is concerned.First being the execution/direction, including the way it has been brilliantly shot making you feel the rustic ambiance of the locations. Particularly the second half which has more happening on the screen as compared to the first. The writing is noteworthy with dialogues written exactly in the way they are spoken in such remote areas with all those cuss words. Second are the performances by the entire cast excelling their own previous acts undoubtedly. Lead from the front by Manoj Bajpayee, GOW would not have been possible without him for sure. The actor plays his role with such ease and conviction that you are bound to ask that from where he actually belongs from. Along with Manoj stands tall, a surprisingly competent performance from the director of PAAN SINGH TOMAR, Tigmanshu Dhulia, who is truly mesmerizing. With his superb act he clearly reveals the secret that why all the actors always come out with such great award winning performances in his directed movies. That's because he himself knows the art so well. Completing the trio is Piyush Mishra, who once again reminds the industry the power house of talent within himself of being an actor, writer, lyricist, singer and composer. In the supporting cast, Jaideep Ahlawat, Jameel Khan, Pankaj Tripathi, Vipin Sharma & Yashpal Sharma (in a cameo) are really great sinking deep into their respective characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui gets into the limelight towards the climax and looks like he is going to be the surprise package of GOW-II (as shown in the trailer). In the female lead, there is another power packed performance from Richa Chadda, who is still remembered as the OYE LUCKY LUCKY OYE girl. But after this movie, she is sure going to be called as GANGS OF WASSEYPUR girl. Reema Sen superbly provides the much needed subtle, sensuality to the project and so does Huma Qureshi who has a much meatier role in Part II. Last but not the least comes the Soundtrack of the film by the extremely talented Sneha Khanwalkar which exactly provides the director what he needed to enhance the overall impact of the film on the viewers. The songs are earthy & folk mixed with the modern arrangement and even sung by the local singers which perfectly suit the mood of the film. Anurag intelligently uses the tracks merged in the background score which neither hinders the pace nor work as an obstacle to his narration.So, GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is sure going to get rave reviews from all corners. But whether the same would be the result on the Box Office or not remains dicey. The film is no doubt exceptional in the way it is presented, enacted and executed. Still its overall theme remains the routine with nothing new to offer to the common viewer and there are too many characters thrown in by the director in his narrative.

9.0,"""Amazing 5 hours.""","The good thing for the film was its screening in two parts. It's not that you will not like the film for 5 hours but there are a few moments when you might feel bored. Now about the film I would say that this is the only film that I can remember now, the characters of which you would bond so much. Making such a long film is a great risk and that was worth it. The story is purely based on revenge. What these 5 hours has made us feel in the end was that the revenge was truly authentic. You will bond entirely with all that hatred. Of Course we have to pick up a side with whom we sympathize. The shaking feeling was when Ramadheer singh told Faisal that the whole fighting had started due to his grandfather and he wanted to live, otherwise his grandfather might have killed him. This was the moment when I realized that he was not at all wrong in his place of thinking. But then I also realized the power of films. The director wanted us to have sympathy with the family of Manoj Vajpayee. That is one angle of showing the film. There can be a story made from the point of Ramadheer where we will sympathize with him.While watching the film I felt like I am revisiting a lot of films. There were a lot of instances when one can feel that he is watching the Indian version of godfather. Now the way this film is made defines what inspiration is. I also felt in the last 30 minutes like I was watching instances of City of God. Anurag Kashyap has properly set a standard for the Indian Directors about how to take inspiration from foreign films. When the audience sees that the starting scenes and the characters which were shown so early are linked in the end, they are hooked to the seats. They might feel amazed at that instant (also considering the fact that all these important twists and links are shown in the last 20 minutes of the film) and say that the film is amazing after leaving theater. While this is obvious for the Indian Audience who is deprived of such stories since they are used to watch senseless themes of Cocktail and many others. So, I would not say that the story or anything is so amazing, but this is what the audience of India need to start with. There is a lot more potential in filmmaking and I have no doubt that Anurag Kashyap too has that power to make films like the seventh seal. But he is bound by the mindset of our audience. I believe that he is taking his viewer's through a carefully chosen path to make them mature enough to understand films of Ingmar Bergman or Stanley Kubrick.PROS:The film has a good story along with good performances which is the first reason to watch the film. To keep the viewer engaged, the film has a lot of twists till the end. I would not consider this film in the black comedy genre but it definitely has so many instances when you will praise the director for his witticism. Coming over to the songs, I felt that the soundtrack was better in the second part. The best humoristic moment in the film was when the two goons were catching each other and their bikes went out of petrol. That moment was too hilarious. Both are standing in the queue to fill the tank. There are many instances like this which gives you authentic feel of India. The second part bagged good songs as well. The portrayal of the ladies in the family was awesome. The way that the film involved us in their daily household activities was something not usual in Indian Films. Coming to the characters, I got attached with Nawajuddin Shiddiki much more than Manoj Vajpayee. His portrayal was very close to that of Al Pacino in Godfather. All the supporting cast performed extremely well.In all, rarely in Indian cinema has this type of film been made especially with so much characters and their development.MESSAGE: ""!!Revenge!!""VERDICT: ""A must watch""",amazing 5 hours,good thing film was its screening two parts its not that you will not like film 5 hours but there are few moments when you might feel bored now about film i would say that this is only film that i can remember now characters which you would bond so much making such long film is great risk that was worth it story is purely based revenge what these 5 hours has made us feel end was that revenge was truly authentic you will bond entirely with all that hatred course we have pick up side with whom we sympathize shaking feeling was when ramadheer singh told faisal that whole fighting had started due his grandfather he wanted live otherwise his grandfather might have killed him this was moment when i realized that he was not at all wrong his place thinking but then i also realized power films director wanted us have sympathy with family manoj vajpayee that is one angle showing film there can be story made point ramadheer where we will sympathize with him while watching film i felt like i am revisiting lot films there were lot instances when one can feel that he is watching indian version godfather now way this film is made defines what inspiration is i also felt last 30 minutes like i was watching instances city god anurag kashyap has properly set standard indian directors about how take inspiration foreign films when audience sees that starting scenes characters which were shown so early are linked end they are hooked seats they might feel amazed at that instant also considering fact that all these important twists links are shown last 20 minutes film say that film is amazing after leaving theater while this is obvious indian audience who is deprived such stories since they are used watch senseless themes cocktail many others so i would not say that story or anything is so amazing but this is what audience india need start with there is lot more potential filmmaking i have no doubt that anurag kashyap too has that power make films like seventh seal but he is bound by mindset our audience i believe that he is taking his viewers through carefully chosen path make them mature enough understand films ingmar bergman or stanley kubrick pros film has good story along with good performances which is first reason watch film keep viewer engaged film has lot twists till end i would not consider this film black comedy genre but it definitely has so many instances when you will praise director his witticism coming over songs i felt that soundtrack was better second part best humoristic moment film was when two goons were catching each other their bikes went out petrol that moment was too hilarious both are standing queue fill tank there are many instances like this which gives you authentic feel india second part bagged good songs as well portrayal ladies family was awesome way that film involved us their daily household activities was something not usual indian films coming characters i got attached with nawajuddin shiddiki much more than manoj vajpayee his portrayal was very close that al pacino godfather all supporting cast performed extremely well all rarely indian cinema has this type film been made especially with so much characters their development message revenge verdict must watch,0.5034391534391536,0.21046004260289972,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,"A raw,real revenge drama with epic dimensions by genius Kahsyap","In India the film will be released in two parts.Here I am reviewing the first part of the epic.With Smriti Irani gleefully welcoming the whole nation to Tulsi's family of ""Kyun ki saans bhi kabhi bahu thi""(famous Indian soap opera),the family setting is disrupted by a series of bang-bang thus setting the mood for a raw violent epic tale of deceit and revenge.Welcome to Anurag Kashyap's take on the violent gang-war of coal mafia in Bihar,the movie is one of rare docu-fiction made in India that has the signature mark of Kashyap–arguably the best Indian film maker of current generation.The movie runs for a span of six decades telling us the evolution of coal mafia to its pinnacle of violence. With Sahid Khan impersonating the legendary Sultana Daku starts looting the trains just prior to the Indian independence. With Shahid Khan being thrown away from the village in Dhanbad he started working in a coal mine from where the game of rivalry took its first step as Shahid Khan was betrayed and killed by Ramadhir Singh's henchmen and later on Shahid's son Sardar vowed to take revenge. The basic premise is simple about the age-old tale of son avenging the death of his father and how it all gets engulfed into a family rivalry with lies, treacheries and betrayals. The executions seem to be homage to Tarantino as the tale moves forward with its blood soaked screenplay.There is intelligent use of wit and one-liners which helps in building the proceedings. Rarely have we seen humor revolving around slaughtered bodies and body parts in desi films. As the movie spans over decades there is key eye for detailing which are reflected in every sequences. The usage of black and white footages increases the credibility of the docu-drama. Like Kashyap's previous films this also deals with the dark psychology of human. This time he chooses to unmask the violent reality ruling in the heart land of our country and ropes in enough humor to unleash the stark reality. For people of Wasseypur killing is like having lunch and that disturbing essence has been beautifully captured. The violent existence had injected hatred in the nerves of each individual. Syed Qadri should be applauded for having the courage to write the story. Being hailed from Wasseypur he even got life threatening calls for the story. Technically GOW is one of the best films of recent times and indeed shows reflection for the praises that are shown in various film festivals. Direction from Kashyap is unquestionably top-notch. Rajeev Ravi's camera makes the proceeding more real. Shot in real locations the camera and colors hops between reality and fiction playing with various colors. Sneha Khanwalkar's music is one of the real heroes of the film. Whenever the scenes were tending to get a little repetitive the music saves the scene. Sneha's music reflected the particular era. While ""Ik Bagal"" hits the right notes for 40s, ""Hunter"" is a effective modern day rendition of imagination of a person who is at ""high"".Without giving any spoilers I would say the sequence of ""Jiya ho Bihar ke lala"" and the way it has been shot in itself becomes a learning lesson for many budding film makers. Also without glorifying violence Kashyap seamlessly merges blood into the narrative and not for a single moment it looked gory.There is no space for melodrama or pseudo-morality. In fact he can give a lesson to mainstream film makers of effective use of action in a realistic yet entertaining fashion. I couldn't think of anyone except Manoj Bajpayee as Sardar Khan who has revenge in his mind but his weakness for female body costs him dearly. Richa Chadda as Nagma Khatoon excels in every scene.The rebellious wife of Sardar is probably the best written character in this film. Nagma is sensitive yet ferocious who has a clear thought process and her character symbolizes freedom otherwise absent in wives of male-dominated India.Tigmanshu Dhulia as Ramadheer Singh patronizes evil and he is a treat to watch.A superb director himself he showed that he is equally brilliant in front of the camera as well. After being part of several films Pankaj Tripathy really gets his due in a meaty role and he proved himself as Sultan Qureshi. The anger oozes out from his personality thus shaping the character.Piyush Mishra is as always effective and dependable.He speaks with his eyes and their lies the talent of the veteran.His lyrics here are as strong as the ones in Gulaal. . Reema Sen effective as Durga. Nawazuddin Siddiqui excels as Faizal Khan the younger and the rebellious son of Sardar Khan.He is there only in the last hour of the first part but one could gauge that he will dominate the second installment.His fiancé' débutant Huma Qureshi is gorgeous and spontaneous. Jaideep Ahlawat as Shahid Khan is superlative. He simply had the necessary energy to spark the proceedings in the initial hours.He steals the scene where his wife is about to deliver her child and yet he is caged in a coal mine following which he fights back with his master.It symbolizes the life we are leading at present when we are buried under burden of material existence and can't stand behind our beloved even in harsh times.There are many such sequences which work as metaphors to the degradation of the standard of life.Overall GOW-I is a epic masterpiece. Kashyap dares to go beyond the conventional means while telling an off-repeated story of revenge.In fact this film is a case study for film makers who can learn the art and use it to make something unconventional yet entertaining.As a film lover I am eagerly waiting for GOWII.P.S:The trailer of GOWII sets the mood with characters like Perpendicular,Definite,Tangent.The film looks to be more quirky than the first installment.One of the characters,a lean structure shown chewing a blade with an assassin look seem straight out of Tarantino films and my expectation increases manifold.",raw

This film lacks that idea, and creates an extremely generic, clichéd crime film that more than certainly over stays it's welcome. This movie took me two days to watch, and throughout I was wondering if it was possible to get any more boring. 320 minutes of hacking off limbs, weird music scores in the middle of a scene and nonintellectual dialogue just ruin what could have been an epic if they could have pulled off such a runtime.Ultimately Gangs Of Wasseypur fails on a grand scale. Nothing in this film is remotely interesting, the film takes too long to end (hence it takes too long for anything meaningful to happen) and the direction, acting and script almost make it the worst I've seen.
