10.0,A cinematic acheivement in not just animation but film,"Many say that being the greatest film of all time is inacheiveable. There are many options as to what that film could be. But if you are a 1000000 IQ, social-economic genius like me who enjoys emotionally mature, and rich movies you can say without a shadow of a doubt that The Emoji Movie is at the top of your list. Where do I begin with this diamond in the rough. How about the characters:The characters are the best I've ever seen. Each character introduced made me smile and jump up with joy more than the last. Like the Hi-5 emoji played by James Corden, who does an Oscar-worthy job portraying this hand with an eating disorder. Always how I pictured my hand. He made me laugh the most in this sea of endless laughs, but we'll get to that in a moment. My favorite scene with him is when he vomits up a candy corn and Gene tells him not to eat it again, and he eats it again! I was on the floor clenching my stomach. Gene's emotional ""emoji"" struggle is something for the ages and Jailbreak's feminity is so inspirational. They could've fallen into cliches for her, but they managed to avoid it in the best way possible with a line that perfectly capitivates her character: ""Women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for."" Perfect feminist icon. And the other characters are so fluid and fun like the Patrick Stewart one who gives birth to another poop!The writing is a chef's kiss personified. The laughs are spot-on with each joke giving me more of a reason to watch like other amazing epics like Arctic Dogs and Shark Tale. The scenes and their construction are beyond godly. The flow of the film flows more naturally as it continues to dance the emoji pop! The product placements were perfectly integrated into the story and I hardly noticed them most of the time. They were THAT subtle unlike The Lego Movie which completely flopped on that front. The animation is at a crisp 100 frames per second at 4K quality. It was orgasmic to see the characters moving on screen. And how could I forget about Alex? Yeah screw Inside Out, this is just the more clearly defined version of Riley complete with the song Bubble butt! The human girl character is on number 3 on my current waifu list which I will post later on Youtube. She is also heavily defined which unlike most Pixar films, made me feel like I needed to do this thing.My main crique with this astonishing work of art is that it has no minions. No references, no jokes about them, not even a shout out. The movie didn't even have minion like characters. If it had them, dang it it would've been a 1234/100 but it will just get a 1233/100 from me.

10.0,Why are people disliking this funny Emoji movie? I liked the movie and laughed the entire time.,"I have seen this movie and let me tell you I liked it very much, the jokes were funny and clever and more relevant than Wreck-it-Ralph 2 Ralph Breaks the Internet. I liked the poop jokes, jokes about social media, including youtube, facebook and the twitter bird.This movie is about Gene who's nervous that he makes weird faces as his cell phone user Alex is trying to send a text during class time but the weird emoji face that was sent made Alex think his phone has a problem, Alex then decides to go to the cellphone store to have it deleted.Meanwhile Gene has a hard time keeping his meh face and Smiler threatens to delete him with the anti-virus robots which makes Gene a fugitive. Gene makes friends with Hi-5, together they go to the troll bar and meets the hacker named Jailbreak. Together they have adventures in the game Candy Crush and play in the Just Dance app game, they also surf the Internet to get to the dumpster to save their friend Hi-5, finally they run into the Firewall and Gene struggles to get access granted to Dropbox, Gene has doubts about changing himself and doesn't go though with it. Then Gene gets kidnapped by robots. Genes parents distract the anti-virus robots with youtube cat videos. Then Gene is saved from deletion, but Alex starts deleting the Emoji's world and Gene quickly makes different faces and Alex's girlfriend is impressed and Alex quickly cancels the deletion and the world goes back to normal.I liked this movie very much, the jokes were funny even better than Wreck-it-Ralph 2, I liked the worlds the Emojis surfed in, the twitter bird was funny, I liked how Genes parents distracted the robots with youtube cat videos, I also liked the devil emoji, the monkey emojis, the poop emoji, the little baby strawberries. I liked how the buildings were colorful and creative, I liked the trolls in the bar, the annoying spam letter woman, I liked Candy Crush, Just Dance with the just dance girl character. Anyways it was the funniest animated movie I've ever seen next to Wreck-it-Ralph and The Lego Movie.If any of you imdb users disagree with me, well then tough, I like the Emoji Movie, I will disagree with the users that didn't like this movie, I did however hated the movie Peter Rabbit Sony company made a year later in 2018, but that's in a different review. Anyways please give this funny animated movie a chance, it was an original movie that worked in every way that made it funny throughout the entire film. Yes this is an 86 minute advertisement but it was better than Wreck-it-Ralph 2 because they had more funny jokes.I would've liked the Sony Company to explore the cellphone addiction the human characters had, especially Alex I would've been interested in the negative consequences that it has on Alex's life.Yes this is rated PG and a little crude humor but it's funny to watch.",why are people disliking this funny emoji movie i liked movie laughed entire time,i have seen this movie let me tell you i liked it very much jokes were funny clever more relevant than wreck it ralph 2 ralph breaks internet i liked poop jokes jokes about social media including youtube facebook twitter bird this movie is about gene whos nervous that he makes weird faces as his cell phone user alex is trying send text during class time but weird emoji face that was sent made alex think his phone has problem alex then decides go cellphone store have it deleted meanwhile gene has hard time keeping his meh face smiler threatens delete him with anti virus robots which makes gene fugitive gene makes friends with hi 5 together they go troll bar meets hacker named jailbreak together they have adventures game candy crush play just dance app game they also surf internet get dumpster save their friend hi 5 finally they run into firewall gene struggles get access granted dropbox gene has doubts about changing himself doesnt go though with it then gene gets kidnapped by robots genes parents distract anti virus robots with youtube cat videos then gene is saved deletion but alex starts deleting emojis world gene quickly makes different faces alexs girlfriend is impressed alex quickly cancels deletion world goes back normal i liked this movie very much jokes were funny even better than wreck it ralph 2 i liked worlds emojis surfed twitter bird was funny i liked how genes parents distracted robots with youtube cat videos i also liked devil emoji monkey emojis poop emoji little baby strawberries i liked how buildings were colorful creative i liked trolls bar annoying spam letter woman i liked candy crush just dance with just dance girl character anyways it was funniest animated movie ive ever seen next wreck it ralph lego movie if any you imdb users disagree with me well then tough i like emoji movie i will disagree with users that didnt like this movie i did however hated movie peter rabbit sony company made year later 2018 but thats different review anyways please give this funny animated movie chance it was original movie that worked every way that made it funny throughout entire film yes this is 86 minute advertisement but it was better than wreck it ralph 2 because they had more funny jokes i wouldve liked sony company explore cellphone addiction human characters had especially alex i wouldve been interested negative consequences that it has alexs life yes this is rated pg little crude humor but its funny watch,0.6557499999999999,0.16760185185185178,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,Seriously underrated,"I had some concerns that all the hate for this movie was founded, but I have found that a lot of either box-office bombs or hated movies or both are actually better than people make out (with the exception of The Adventures of Scooter the Penguin), so I decided that I would give it a go. Now, this is by far the most unoriginal movie ever - it's general plot, themes, and stuff are all stuff that we've seen time and time again. It has some of the cheesiest lines in history (with Aquaman coming in a close second). It is also extremely predictable. But it has a talented cast who's voices are just perfect for their roles, great animation, and you know what? It doesn't hurt to hear the message that this movie showcases once again as it is actually relevant. And while it is predictable it also is entertaining enough to keep you interested. Though, if you don't like the plot, give it a shot for the music. The music in it is fantastic, even if you don't like the plot. It's meant to be a funny, feel-good, charming movie greatly succeeds in that regard. Give it a shot, though I can't guarantee whether or not you'd like it.",seriously underrated,i had some concerns that all hate this movie was founded but i have found that lot either box office bombs or hated movies or both are actually better than people make out with exception adventures scooter penguin so i decided that i would give it go now this is by far most unoriginal movie ever its general plot themes stuff are all stuff that weve seen time time again it has some cheesiest lines history with aquaman coming close second it is also extremely predictable but it has talented cast whos voices are just perfect their roles great animation you know what it doesnt hurt hear message that this movie showcases once again as it is actually relevant while it is predictable it also is entertaining enough keep you interested though if you dont like plot give it shot music music it is fantastic even if you dont like plot its meant be funny feel good charming movie greatly succeeds that regard give it shot though i cant guarantee whether or not youd like it,0.6340277777777777,0.18819444444444447,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
