1.0,You need to have nerve of steel to watch this garbage,"Movie Name - Student Of The Year 2 Genre - Romance / Drama Rating - Disgusting 0.5 /5Sometimes I wonder whether few filmmakers prepares any script before making a film. Spending so much on location, songs and dance would not give the inception of a good film unless script is thoroughly worked upon.SOTY2 tells the story of 3 friends with the Kabaddi Inter School competition at the background - Rohan (Tiger Shroff) who joins the college for his girlfriend, Tara Sutaria. There is a spoilt brat, Ananya Panday, who thinks she can rule the college with her care-free attitude.Director Puneet Malhotra (I Hate Luv Storys, Gori Tere Pyaar Mein) does not do justice to the area of direction at all. As the movie begins, you are greeted by glossy and candy floss environment of college (reminds you of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Student Of The Year 2012 ) with unnecessary insertion of songs. The main drama unfolds in the later reel which again is intolerable with screenplay written surely by a school kid. Art direction and Cinematography is excellent especially. Songs are poor. Dialogues are less-impacting. Performances are over-top. Tiger Shroff does his best but could not do much with the lame script. Glam dolls -Tara Sutaria and Ananya Panday are meant for making the film more attractive.Overall, a pathetic film in every sense.",you need have nerve steel watch this garbage,movie name student year 2 genre romance drama rating disgusting 0 5 5sometimes i wonder whether few filmmakers prepares any script before making film spending so much location songs dance would not give inception good film unless script is thoroughly worked upon soty2 tells story 3 friends with kabaddi inter school competition at background rohan tiger shroff who joins college his girlfriend tara sutaria there is spoilt brat ananya panday who thinks she can rule college with her care free attitude director puneet malhotra i hate luv storys gori tere pyaar mein does not do justice area direction at all as movie begins you are greeted by glossy candy floss environment college reminds you kuch kuch hota hai student year 2012 with unnecessary insertion songs main drama unfolds later reel which again is intolerable with screenplay written surely by school kid art direction cinematography is excellent especially songs are poor dialogues are less impacting performances are over top tiger shroff does his best but could not do much with lame script glam dolls tara sutaria ananya panday are meant making film more attractive overall pathetic film every sense,0.5744949494949494,0.06818181818181818,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.42}"
