,"""N'Oublie Pas Les Ordures""","So here it is, the landmark film which ushered in the Nouvelle Vague, introduced Francois Truffaut and his screen persona Antoine Doinel to the world, and changed the direction of cinema for ever. And an impressive piece of work it is, too.   By 1959 the process of film-making had atrophied (artistically, at any rate). Stale and stagey artifice was the norm, and for the upcoming generation of film-makers and critics (Truffaut was both) a new way of conceiving cinematic art had to be found. In this, his feature film debut, Truffaut found it.   This is cinema verite at its freshest and best. The film looks like a documentary and absolutely drips with kitchen-sink candour. A handheld camera follows Antoine around his parents' flat and we get to peer in on the grimy, cramped and oh-so-ordinary minutiae of a humble little life. ""Don't forget the garbage,"" Antoine is repeatedly told, and Truffaut certainly doesn't. He pulls off with resounding success the seemingly impossible feat of making the mundane seem entirely absorbing.   ""C'est peut-etre un question de glandes,"" suggests a teacher as we see the adolescent Antoine go quietly off the rails. Paris (or more accurately, that part of Paris bounded by Montmartre and the Gare du Nord) is wintry and stark, the unlovely and prosaic environment in which Antoine functions - or fails to function. Truffaut wants, inter alia, to deflate the ""April In Paris"" myth so virulent in the 1950's. He succeeds mightily. Antoine is disaffected. Parents, home and school are all inhospitable and the sleety, foggy streets south of Pigalle convey Antoine's alienation admirably.   Deadpan humour is a powerful weapon in Truffaut's armoury. Antoine's inept note-forging, the outlandish excuse which he gives for his absence and his long-suffering look during his mother's reminiscences are all nicely done and raise a chuckle. The bird's-eye view of the P.T. class, shot with a rooftop camera, conveys wordlessly the comedy of the rapidly diminishing line of pupils.   A punch and judy show is filmed from inside the performance canopy, looking out onto the audience of small children. Their total lack of artifice is delightful to see, and underscores Truffaut's point - candour is beautiful, staginess is unacceptable. As Antoine's father frogmarches him along the street after the typewriter debacle, bemused passers-by stop to stare at the camera. Not only is this disarmingly honest, it is also profound. Cinema should exist, as it were, inside the camera, not in elaborate sets. Antoine rides in the spinning drum at the fairground, the camera fixed rigidly on him, allowing the onlookers to dissolve into an undistinguished blur. The camera IS Antoine's subjective self.   The performance of 15-year-old Jean-Pierre Leaud as Antoine is astonishingly good. He is natural and engaging, and his soliloquy (delivered to the psychologist) seems an incredible piece of work for so young an actor.   A long, long tracking shot accompanies Antoine as he runs away from it all, and is intended to convey, by the very rhythm of his breathing, the internal subjectivity of a child who has been let down by his parents and his society. The final freeze-frame, with no histrionic fireworks, no resounding words and no tidy denouement, closes the film on a note of immense emotional power. Antoine is alone.",noublie pas les ordures,so here it is landmark film which ushered nouvelle vague introduced francois truffaut his screen persona antoine doinel world changed direction cinema ever impressive piece work it is too by 1959 process film making had atrophied artistically at any rate stale stagey artifice was norm upcoming generation film makers critics truffaut was both new way conceiving cinematic art had be found this his feature film debut truffaut found it this is cinema verite at its freshest best film looks like documentary absolutely drips with kitchen sink candour handheld camera follows antoine around his parents flat we get peer grimy cramped oh so ordinary minutiae humble little life dont forget garbage antoine is repeatedly told truffaut certainly doesnt he pulls off with resounding success seemingly impossible feat making mundane seem entirely absorbing cest peut etre un question de glandes suggests teacher as we see adolescent antoine go quietly off rails paris or more accurately that part paris bounded by montmartre gare du nord is wintry stark unlovely prosaic environment which antoine functions or fails function truffaut wants inter alia deflate april paris myth so virulent 1950s he succeeds mightily antoine is disaffected parents home school are all inhospitable sleety foggy streets south pigalle convey antoines alienation admirably deadpan humour is powerful weapon truffauts armoury antoines inept note forging outlandish excuse which he gives his absence his long suffering look during his mothers reminiscences are all nicely done raise chuckle birds eye view p t class shot with rooftop camera conveys wordlessly comedy rapidly diminishing line pupils punch judy show is filmed inside performance canopy looking out onto audience small children their total lack artifice is delightful see underscores truffauts point candour is beautiful staginess is unacceptable as antoines father frogmarches him along street after typewriter debacle bemused passers by stop stare at camera not only is this disarmingly honest it is also profound cinema should exist as it were inside camera not elaborate sets antoine rides spinning drum at fairground camera fixed rigidly him allowing onlookers dissolve into undistinguished blur camera is antoines subjective self performance 15 year old jean pierre leaud as antoine is astonishingly good he is natural engaging his soliloquy delivered psychologist seems incredible piece work so young actor long long tracking shot accompanies antoine as he runs away it all is intended convey by very rhythm his breathing internal subjectivity child who has been let down by his parents his society final freeze frame with no histrionic fireworks no resounding words no tidy denouement closes film note immense emotional power antoine is alone,0.5476944772399316,0.11581988718352353,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,One of the shining stars of the French New Wave,"Every day life, however 'real' and gritty it may be, is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950's. In Europe however, there was a movement in film-making that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the 'here and now'. This is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the French New Wave of the 1950's  films that explored the filmmaker's surroundings, and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. Francois Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows' is one of the most well-known films of this movement, and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.After viewing Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows', I have been ruminating over the deeper meaning behind his story of Antoine Doinel, a 14 year old boy in Paris who is having trouble in school and trouble at home. In school, he is marginalized as a trouble-maker, yet it is obvious that it is more a matter of him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments. At home, Doinel has to deal with an adulterous mother who only pays attention to him when it suits her needs, and a father who is barely present. Doinel responds by doing the only thing he feels he can do, and that is by acting up; eventually earning an expulsion from school and being sent to a juvenile prison camp by his parents. Nothing is cut and dry in 'The 400 Blows'. If one were to take the film at face value, there would be a 'so what' feeling. What the film subtly explores is the disenfranchisement of youth. There is no joy in Doinel's life  anytime he tries to express himself creatively or acts up in a playful way he is shot down and metaphorically forced back into line. This is not a typical Paris street kid either, this is one who reads Balzac for pleasure and conveys intense emotion. The problem is that no one is there to notice or care. Another aspect of the French New Wave was that the films were not merely a product of a Hollywood factory; these were intensely personal films to the writers and directors. In the case of 'The 400 Blows', it is certain that Doinel is based on Truffaut, himself only 28 when he made the film. Truffaut's cinematography in 'The 400 Blows' is exquisite. We see a Paris that is not in Technicolor with colorful fountains like 'An American in Paris'. This is Paris from a Parisian's perspective  and the difference is breathtaking and intense. These are not Louis XVI style houses, they are tiny flats where people have to sleep in closets and walk up and down six flights of stairs. The city views are those of a native Parisian  the kind of tour one would get if they asked the average Parisian for non-tourist attractions.There is still a lot that I have to learn and think about 'The 400 Blows' and French New Wave in general, but with the minute amount of understanding I have of it, I found it to be an intense film, one that left me emotional and craving enlightenment. Rarely is there a film that leaves that kind of impact on me, but Truffaut managed to leave me speechless and deep in thought with 'The Four Hundred Blows'.--Shel",one shining stars french new wave,every day life however real gritty it may be is rarely portrayed film was certainly rarity 1950s europe however there was movement film making that embraced this realism searched deeper meaning here now this is about most basic miniscule portion meaning behind french new wave 1950s films that explored filmmakers surroundings eventually became inspiration filmmakers around world francois truffauts 400 blows is one most well known films this movement has been embraced hailed as one greatest films all time after viewing truffauts 400 blows i have been ruminating over deeper meaning behind his story antoine doinel 14 year old boy paris who is having trouble school trouble at home school he is marginalized as trouble maker yet it is obvious that it is more matter him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments at home doinel has deal with adulterous mother who only pays attention him when it suits her needs father who is barely present doinel responds by doing only thing he feels he can do that is by acting up eventually earning expulsion school being sent juvenile prison camp by his parents nothing is cut dry 400 blows if one were take film at face value there would be so what feeling what film subtly explores is disenfranchisement youth there is no joy doinels life anytime he tries express himself creatively or acts up playful way he is shot down metaphorically forced back into line this is not typical paris street kid either this is one who reads balzac pleasure conveys intense emotion problem is that no one is there notice or care another aspect french new wave was that films were not merely product hollywood factory these were intensely personal films writers directors case 400 blows it is certain that doinel is based truffaut himself only 28 when he made film truffauts cinematography 400 blows is exquisite we see paris that is not technicolor with colorful fountains like american paris this is paris parisians perspective difference is breathtaking intense these are not louis xvi style houses they are tiny flats where people have sleep closets walk up down six flights stairs city views are those native parisian kind tour one would get if they asked average parisian non tourist attractions there is still lot that i have learn think about 400 blows french new wave general but with minute amount understanding i have it i found it be intense film one that left me emotional craving enlightenment rarely is there film that leaves that kind impact me but truffaut managed leave me speechless deep thought with four hundred blows shel,0.4875884420239257,0.09644486338034723,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,Truffaut's powerful and moving look at adolescence,"THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS (François Truffaut - France 1959).Twelve-year-old Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) has troubles at home and at school. Ignored and neglected by his parents, his relationship with his mother is further strained when he discovers that she has taken a secret lover. Added to this, his school teachers have written him off as a trouble maker and, with luck seemingly never on his side, it is Antoine who ends up getting the blame for bad behaviour. Finding refuge only in his love of cinema, Antoine soon finds it necessary to break free and discover what the world can offer outside the confines of everyday life. I have always struggled with the labeling of this film as one of the pivotal entrances in the ""Nouvelle Vague"". Since Jean-Luc Godard's ""Au Bout de Soufflé"", who uses a completely different approach to film-making, with his restless jump-cutting and endless references to pop culture, Truffaut presents his case clear cut, as realistic as possible. But this was something completely different from the way American films portrayed juvenile delinquency so far. No iconic trouble makers like James Dean or Marlon Brando, just a realistic portrait of a twelve-year old boy sliding into isolation. The very idea alone was something novel, seldom depicted in a way like this. Much of the praise must go to Jean-Pierre Léaud, who never even seems to be acting. His every movement, thought, expression come across as completely natural. Truly, one of the most remarkable performances of such a young actor I've ever seen. Watching this over 40 years after it was made, it all looks deceptively simple, with Truffaut's perfect integration of music and image, location shooting on the streets of Paris and the naturalistic performances. Truffaut used many innovations but they are not easily noticeable as in Godard's work. This was for instance the first French film to be shot in widescreen (aspect ratio 2.35:1), which required much planning on Truffaut's part, with some surprising results. In many scenes we don't see the other person Antoine is talking to, which gives the viewer the illusion as if Antoine is almost talking directly to the camera. Jean-Pierre Léaud would continue his role as Antoine in four more films by Truffaut, ""Love at Twenty"" (1962), ""Stolen Kisses"" (1968), ""Bed and Board"" (1970) and ""Love on the Run"" (1979).Camera Obscura --- 9/10",truffauts powerful moving look at adolescence,four hundred blows fran ois truffaut france 1959 twelve year old antoine doinel jean pierre l aud has troubles at home at school ignored neglected by his parents his relationship with his mother is further strained when he discovers that she has taken secret lover added this his school teachers have written him off as trouble maker with luck seemingly never his side it is antoine who ends up getting blame bad behaviour finding refuge only his love cinema antoine soon finds it necessary break free discover what world can offer outside confines everyday life i have always struggled with labeling this film as one pivotal entrances nouvelle vague since jean luc godards au bout de souffl who uses completely different approach film making with his restless jump cutting endless references pop culture truffaut presents his case clear cut as realistic as possible but this was something completely different way american films portrayed juvenile delinquency so far no iconic trouble makers like james dean or marlon brando just realistic portrait twelve year old boy sliding into isolation very idea alone was something novel seldom depicted way like this much praise must go jean pierre l aud who never even seems be acting his every movement thought expression come across as completely natural truly one most remarkable performances such young actor ive ever seen watching this over 40 years after it was made it all looks deceptively simple with truffauts perfect integration music image location shooting streets paris naturalistic performances truffaut used many innovations but they are not easily noticeable as godards work this was instance first french film be shot widescreen aspect ratio 2 35 1 which required much planning truffauts part with some surprising results many scenes we dont see other person antoine is talking which gives viewer illusion as if antoine is almost talking directly camera jean pierre l aud would continue his role as antoine four more films by truffaut love at twenty 1962 stolen kisses 1968 bed board 1970 love run 1979 camera obscura 9 10,0.5101073762838467,0.11111111111111112,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,Memorable Story With Thoughtful Direction By Truffaut,"The memorable story of young, troubled Antoine is worth seeing for a good number of reasons, probably most of all for the thoughtful direction by François Truffaut. It stands out from most other movies about troubled youths, both in the way that it portrays the main character and in making such good use of seemingly minor events in showing how they shape Antoine's life.As Antoine, Jean-Pierre Léaud (in the role with which he would always be identified) strikes a nice balance in making his character come to life without making any of his actions seem forced or over-dramatic. Truffaut sets things up for him perfectly, by presenting a great variety of situations in his life that allow Antoine's character to come out naturally. Many of the settings are in themselves interesting and creative, despite being located in familiar types of places.The story is written carefully so as to allow the viewer to identify with and sympathize with Antoine, while still seeing his faults clearly. What is often the most affecting thing about it is the way that Truffaut shows how even the most commonplace kinds of events can have such an effect on a maturing person, if they are a source of disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions. To make this kind of movie so effectively without relying on violent or shocking material is an admirable achievement, and it repays careful thought and attention while watching it.",memorable story with thoughtful direction by truffaut,memorable story young troubled antoine is worth seeing good number reasons probably most all thoughtful direction by fran ois truffaut it stands out most other movies about troubled youths both way that it portrays main character making such good use seemingly minor events showing how they shape antoines life as antoine jean pierre l aud role with which he would always be identified strikes nice balance making his character come life without making any his actions seem forced or over dramatic truffaut sets things up him perfectly by presenting great variety situations his life that allow antoines character come out naturally many settings are themselves interesting creative despite being located familiar types places story is written carefully so as allow viewer identify with sympathize with antoine while still seeing his faults clearly what is often most affecting thing about it is way that truffaut shows how even most commonplace kinds events can have such effect maturing person if they are source disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions make this kind movie so effectively without relying violent or shocking material is admirable achievement it repays careful thought attention while watching it,0.6525462962962962,0.18564814814814812,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,"Groundbreaking and semi-autobiographic film that initiated Truffaut's long career , concerning a peculiar character , Antoine Doinel","This classic and unforgettable movie with amazing freshness catapulted Truffaut to international acclaim , dealing with a the trails and rebellious of 13-year-old Antoine Doinel . He is a rogue French schoolboy , starred by an adolescent Jean-Pierre Léaud , being the first of Doinel series , following : L'amour à vingt ans (original title) or El amor a los veinte años (1962) , a Short titled Antoine et Colette (1962) , Stolen kisses or Baisers volés (original title) (1968) , Bed and Board or Domicile conjugal (1970) , Love on the run or L'amour en fuite (1979) . The downtroddem , neglected and rebel teen Doinel delves into a life of petty crime . Antoine (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is often in trouble at school , especially with his French teacher 'Petite Feuille', (Guy Decomble) and doesn't get along with his parents (Claire Maurier , Albert Remi) , particularly his mum . While his friend René suggests that they play truant . Both of whom often skip school to go to a funfair attraction park or to carry out tiny theft . Antoine and Rene are suspended from school , they go gallivanting around the town. Unless something drastic changes in Antoine's life, he is destined down a path that will lead to nothing good, which is more problematic as he gets older. Instead of going to school, Antoine along with his friend René go to the cinema, play pinball, and visit a huge amusement rotor , a real funfair attraction . The following day Antoine tells his teacher that his absence was due to his mother's death; unfortunately his parents show up at school .Then he briefly runs away from home but then goes back . Things go wrong when Antoine to get money steals a typewriter from his father's office , being trapped by a janitor. It is quasi-autobiographical account of 13-year-old Antoine's bleak odyssey through family life , reform school whose precarious permanence is questioned and getaway . From the Vanguard of New Film-Makers Comes an Extraordinary Motion Picture . The Best Directed Picture Cannes International Film Festival 1959 . Angel faces hell-bent for violence.Still one of the cinema's most sensitive , perceptive forays into infancy , it is intensely stirring but never mawkish , as Truffaut reveals an actual complicity with the rebellious teenager , being François 's first major motion picture. Shot on location in Paris in almost-documentary style and with a casually vivid eye . An increasingly compromised and attractive work in which Truffat demonstrates his narrative skills , being infinitely better than other self-indulgent films towards the end of his career . Fun for spotting the guest appearance of such Nouvelle Vague French luminaries such as Jacques Demy , Jeanne Moreau , Jean Claude Brialy , Jean Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut himself .Thought-provoking and engaging finale when a juvenile-court judge sends him to an observation centre in the countryside, from where he runs away, and doesn't stop until he reaches the sea , there takes place the frozen image of the boy face ; is it point of no return or freedom ? .Truffaut was seeking a young actor able to play Antoine Doinel, a troubled adolescent, in his first feature film ""The 400 blows"". Jean-Pierre was tested among a hundred other candidates and proved so amazingly spontaneous and so gifted for improvisation that not only was he hired but he would go on to play the role in four subsequent Truffaut semi-autobiographies concluding with ""Love on the run"" (1978), a unique experience indeed. Well starred by the boy Jean-Pierre Léaud with a long career along with Truffaut , Leaud is not everybody's cup of tea for sure, but will remain an important name in film history. Thanks to Truffaut he was introduced to the other stars of the French New Wave, mainly Jean-Luc Godard for whom he would appear in eight films and one TV film, and gradually became their icon. As an actor he can be adored or hated for exactly the same reasons: he is one of those rare players that directors let improvise his dialogue, which gets on certain viewers' nerves while it fascinates others . The same is true for his very personal staccato diction and elocution and his many mannerisms, the most obvious one being his way to run his hand through his long hair. This is a semi-biography of Truffaut himself , in fact the French director François Truffaut began to assiduously go to the movies at age seven similar to Jean-Pierre Léaud and he was even a great reader but not a good pupil . He left school at 14 and started working. Furthermore , the movie is dedicated to Andre Bazin , aged 15, as he founded a film club and met André Bazin , a French critic, who became his protector. Bazin helped the delinquent Truffaut and also when he was put in jail because he deserted the army .It displays an atmospheric musical score by Antoine Duhamel , Truffaut's usual musician . As well as an evocative , adequate cinematography in black and while and documentary style by prestigious cameraman Henry Decae . The motion picture was competently directed by Truffaut , being one of the greatest and most influential of his films . His main themes were passion, women , childhood and faithfulness . His films gets several references to the American cinema, as Truffaut was a fervent moviegoer, such as : Johnny Guitar, Bogart, and his idolized Hitchcock . In fact , he was a big Alfred Hitchcock fan and defined him as his master . In 1953 Truffaut published his first movie critiques in ""Les Cahiers du Cinema."" In this magazine Truffaut, and some of his friends as passionate as he was, became defenders of what they call the ""author policy"". In 1954, as a test, Truffaut directed his first short film. Two years afterwords he assisted Roberto Rossellini with some later abandoned projects . The year 1957 was an important one for him: he married Madeleine Morgenstern, the daughter of an important film distributor, and founded his own production company, Les Films du Carrosse; named after Jean Renoir's Le carrosse d'or (1952). He also directed Les mistons or the brats (1957), considered the real first step of his cinematographic work. His other big year was 1959: the huge success of his first full-length film, 400 blows (1959), was the beginning of the New Wave, a new way of making movies in France. This was also the year his first daughter, Laura Truffaut, was born. From 1959 until his death, François Truffaut's life and films are mixed up. Let's only note he had two other daughters Eva Truffaut (b. 1961) and Josephine (b. 1982, with French actress Fanny Ardant). He also directed thrillers and intrigue movies such as ¨Shoot the piano player¨ is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¨Farenheit 451¨, ¨Mississippi mermaid¨ , and ¨The Bride Wore Black¨.

9.0,Deserved Truffaut Classic Benefits Significantly from Criterion's New DVD Package,"As the seminal work of the French New Wave, the 1959 directorial debut of 27-year old Francois Truffaut has such a vaunted reputation that the final film is bound to disappoint. However, the pristine print that comes with the new Criterion Collection DVD really makes me realize what a brave and emotionally resonant film he made ostensibly about his own troubled adolescence. It's worth seeing twice - once for the film itself and a second time to listen to the newly recorded commentary by Truffaut's childhood friend Robert Lachenay (the true-life inspiration for Rene in the film). Speaking in French but subtitled in English, he provides insights into the story and context of the film that no film scholar or even production associate could possibly provide. As a point of comparison, listen to the by-the-numbers commentary by film scholar Brian Stonehill (recorded back in 1992), which is thoughtful and well researched but devoid of the human factor.The film's title comes from a French colloquialism that translates into ""raising hell"", an appropriate reference since the story focuses on a thirteen-year old hellion named Antoine, living in a poor section of Paris and neglected by parents downright arrogant in their dysfunctional nature. Antoine consequently lives a street urchin's life as he lies to people in authority - his parents, his teachers, and the police - since he admits rather sadly that the truth doesn't make any difference. Truffaut tracks Antoine's life through a series of dispiriting episodes that ultimately lead him to be sent away to a reformatory after he gets caught returning a stolen typewriter and his mother and stepfather tire of their responsibility over him. To Truffaut's immense credit, the film feels stark and naturalistic without resorting to dramatic manipulation, and he finds the ideal Antoine in Jean-Pierre Leaud, who brings out the confusion, angst and wandering attention of his character in realistic terms. He is especially impressive in an apparently improvised scene where he is interviewed by the school authorities about why his life has come to this. It is heartbreaking to see how bleak his life becomes, yet Leaud imbues the incorrigible, often intolerable side of Antoine with fervor.There are several interesting extras included with the 2006 DVD package starting with two separate interviews with Truffaut, the first a year after the film's release discussing he film's impact and the second five years later when we see the filmmaker in a more reflective mood about his cinematic influences. Leaud is featured in 16mm screen test footage where his naturally ebullient personality emerges and then after the 1959 Cannes Film Festival where puberty has apparently kicked in and then in 1965 as a comparatively reserved twenty-year old.

,"A magnificent tale about childhood and the quest for liberty, masterfully shot","Les quatre-cents coups is the film that opens up the New Wave movement. I think many of the characteristics of the New Wave -as pointed out in class- can be inferred form the differences between the last film we saw in class, Carné's Les enfants du paradis, and this work by Truffaut: real life situations, no sets, everyday people. I have found in Les quatre-cents coups a brand new, refreshing and overwhelming cinema. But Les quatre-cents coups is also a dense, complicated film. Its autobiographical character makes it an encyclopedia of personal feelings, opinions and nuances of an introspection by Truffaut.Technically, the main differences between Truffaut and the previous cinema is the use of camera movements and angles. Although Renoir had made a witty and fresh use of traveling and long takes, Truffaut masters this technique as anyone else does. The camera moves smoothly, it nearly swings or floats from angle to angle following an action, as if the spectator was a ghost amid real life. Truffaut enjoys playing around with the camera: extremely long takes as we have never seen in any of the previous films: some of them in the classroom, other in Antoine's friend house, or a magnificent take at the end of the film in which we see Antoine, then a panoramic view and then Antoine again, running towards the sea. He also shoots from impossible angles, like those at the beginning from below the Tour Eiffel, or the nearly zenithal take following the jogging students in the streets. Or he teases us with the fake black out, when Antoine goes down the stairs to throw away garbage. Or shows us inner feelings through close-ups: the scene in which Antoine lies to his father telling him he did not take his map.However, I think that the most important difference between previous films and this one is the treatment of action. Truffaut is an observer, a photographer of soul. He takes a fiendish delight in shooting casual, long scenes: the boy tearing away his notebook pages; the whole sequence of Antoine's arrival at his empty home is excellent: the three reflexes in his mother's mirror -in which she will look afterwards, or Antoine combing his hair, laying the table. Also the spinning ride, or the long traveling following the escape of Antoine. They are long, but not slow. They keep tension up, as if everyday acts and decisions could be heroic and transmit the greatest interest and attraction. It looks like a documentary on human life! Some comments could be made about Antoine Doinel, alter ego of Truffaut. He is a very complicated character. The most curious thing about him is that he behaves like an adult: he acts, walks and talks like a man -especially if we compare him to his teachers or his father! However, at some times I think Truffaut describes himself as being not too witty: remember the candle in the hole on the wall, or how his friend convinces him to steal the typewriter and then makes him give it back, or how he innocently copies a whole paragraph from Balzac. He wants to be an artist, but he is not -not yet. This lack of wit and fatality -he is caught but everyone around him cheats as he does- leads him to a rebellion that grows stronger and stronger. This explain why he is such a rebel and not his friend, or the other children in the class, who live in the same social group.The main topic in Les quatre-cents coups is the quest for freedom, but not in the way Renoir looked at it, in fact is closer to L'Atalante by Vigo than to Renoir's La grande illusion, for example. Renoir is more concerned by social struggle and the liberty of the people. But Truffaut is more introspective, more intimate: indeed this film is the description of life attitude of an independent spirit through the autobiographical look of the author -this is cinéma d'auteur. We can find many elements from Truffaut's life in the film: a difficult family situation, problems at school, the Army, etc. These elements will appear throughout the film. Antoine, alter ego of Truffaut lives in the school, in his house, in the streets and finally in the juvenile detention center. In each one of these places he will find adverse situations he will have to overcome.The school The school is the first oppressing environment for Antoine. At the very beginning he is caught, by chance, with a pin-up calendar. This fatality will be recalled in Antoine's life later or -when he is caught by the porter giving the typewriter back, having been his friend's idea to steal it. He is a rebel, and nothing will refrain him from being so. He is punished, and he misbehaves again, writing in the wall an inspired poem. The school is the only place in which Truffaut makes a little bit of criticism, in this case against the education system: the three teachers are either cruel (the French teacher) or stupid (the English and Physical Education teachers).The house The house situation might be similar to that lived by Truffaut in real life. Her mother, a beautiful, egocentric and unscrupulous woman -sometimes sad, and old looking- who hates him. At the end of the film we discover that she did not want that child. This hatred and the attitude of his father -a smiley and cheerful but weak man- will add to the necessity of Antoine to flee. Truffaut gives us a Freudian wink: when his teacher asks him why he missed school, Antoine will sharply answer: 'My mom died!'The streets In the streets Antoine will find freedom, challenge, adulthood but also perversion: he becomes a man in a 13-year old boy body, little by little. But he will also become a criminal; together with his friend they will climb up in the scale of crime. He first skips classes. He and his friend stroll around the city, innocently. Then they begin an adult, abnormally rebel behavior: they make cars stop in the middle of the street, for example. The spinning ride is one of the few symbolic images in the film -that is another difference with Vigo and Renoir filmmaking. The scene of Antoine trying without success to fight against centrifuge force in a mad spinning trip really shocked me: he fights against reality and he is suffering, but he also has fun in it. Afterwards, he leaves home. . He will learn about solitude and indeed not a single word is heard in a long sequence. I really enjoyed the long, silent scene of the milk robbery. Antoine runs outlaw like an animal, we can feel loneliness, cold, hunger, sleepiness. It is another of those long, slow but at the same time agile scenes about casual acts: drinking a bottle of milk. At the end, the streets will make him a criminal. From the moment he is caught on, he is not treated as a child anymore. He wants to be an adult, and a spell will sort of be cast on him: he will be treated as such. It is significant when he is caught by the porter. He is told not to take off the hat, which made him look like an adult. From then on, he is treated roughly as if he was a man, especially in the police station.The prison And finally he arrives at the prison, which I think is the climax of oppression -we must remember the comparisons to the Army Truffaut detests. It is maybe the simplest of the scenarios, he find himself facing what he hates with no other possibility. The ending is a sublime anticlimax. After being punished for eating the bread, Antoine goes on 'normal' life within the detention center: he visits the psychologist -an ultimate introspection by Truffaut-, receives his mother and talk to his new friends and plays soccer. And suddenly, when we least expect it, he flees. He runs, runs, runs, the longest run I have ever seen, and the most exciting. He reaches the sea: his dream, and a symbol for eternity and absolute in poetry. He splashes into the water, he stops and looks back; the first time he looks right into the camera. This has got undoubtedly a deep and very personal meaning that maybe only the author knows. It is a pessimistic or an optimistic ending? I think it is above all an out-of-this-world ending. If the simple presence of the sea, Antoine's object of liberty, is overwhelming for the spectator, how should the character feel? I really liked the final traveling: we follow Antoine's run over the sand, but the camera is facing the inland, we are waiting to see the sea as much as Antoine is waiting to wet his feet. I do not really think that he is deceived, although his look into the camera is ambiguous. I think he stares at the spectator because he has realized what the truth is: the character is now out of the film. And the truth for him, I think, is this: I can reach freedom whenever I want, but absolute freedom is impossible to achieve. He is staring at us, but he is also looking back with a grave look: he might have seen his pursuer in the distance.",magnificent tale about childhood quest liberty masterfully shot,les quatre cents

10.0,Perfection,"I first saw this film around three or four years ago for the first time. I had watched it late at night, and I was very sleepy after it ended. I was rather ambivalent towards it. To tell you the truth, I don't know whether I had even heard of it before I rented it. And I don't even remember if it was my first film by Francois Truffaut, either. I have seen two others, The Green Room, which I didn't like all that much, and Shoot the Piano Player, which I loved. My guess would be that I saw The Green Room first, then looked up what else Francois Truffaut had made, and which ones were considered his better films.Anyhow, by some route I rented The 400 Blows, and, as I said above, it left me unaffected. I went to bed afterwards without thinking much about it. It was only a couple of months later that I realized how good it was. The memories came flooding back one day when someone mentioned it to me. I have had similar experiences with La Dolce Vita and Casablanca, among others. As I thought more and more about it, I realized just how great it was.Still, I never went back to it until now. I am strange in that way. There are some movies, some of which aren't even that good, that I will watch over and over again, alone or with friends. There are other films which I know are great, but that I never feel I have time to revisit them (there are always more films to be watched). The 400 Blows is one of those films, unfortunately. I don't know why. I have even considered purchasing it several times. I never did. So when I saw it tonight, it was like seeing something brand new.I remembered only a few of the most memorable scenes: the carnival ride (followed by Antoine catching his mother with a strange man), the whole Balzac sequence, the psychologist's interview, and, of course, the famous final shot, the freeze-frame of Antoine Doinel looking into the camera. After this time, I will probably remember everything a lot better and a lot longer. The first time, when I was ambivalent, I had time to forget before I finally grabbed hold of those fading memories.Why is this film special? Because it is the perfect example of childhood caught on film. I don't think there is anyone who could watch it without thinking that it rings true. Every piece of film that deals with a similar subject falls behind this one. The only one that I can think of that comes anywhere near is Federico Fellini's _Amarcord_. Jean Vigo's _Zero for Conduct_ is also very interesting, and probably influenced this film a lot (I know Truffaut was familiar with it, but that may not have been until after this film came out). Antoine Doinel is such an endearing character. I hope that sometime soon I can procure and see his other filmic exploits. And I really need to see more Truffaut in general. I'm far behind with him. Well, The 400 Blows deserves a 10/10, no doubt. It is easily one of the best films ever made, and one of those films that any knowledgable person would include it in a list of films that are absolutely necessary for a student of film.",perfection,i first saw this film around three or four years ago first time i had watched it late at night i was very sleepy after it ended i was rather ambivalent towards it tell you truth i dont know whether i had even heard it before i rented it i dont even remember if it was my first film by francois truffaut either i have seen two others green room which i didnt like all that much shoot piano player which i loved my guess would be that i saw green room first then looked up what else francois truffaut had made which ones were considered his better films anyhow by some route i rented 400 blows as i said above it left me unaffected i went bed afterwards without thinking much about it it was only couple months later that i realized how good it was memories came flooding back one day when someone mentioned it me i have had similar experiences with la dolce vita casablanca among others as i thought more more about it i realized just how great it was still i never went back it until now i am strange that way there are some movies some which arent even that good that i will watch over over again alone or with friends there are other films which i know are great but that i never feel i have time revisit them there are always more films be watched 400 blows is one those films unfortunately i dont know why i have even considered purchasing it several times i never did so when i saw it tonight it was like seeing something brand new i remembered only few most memorable scenes carnival ride followed by antoine catching his mother with strange man whole balzac sequence psychologists interview course famous final shot freeze frame antoine doinel looking into camera after this time i will probably remember everything lot better lot longer first time when i was ambivalent i had time forget before i finally grabbed hold those fading memories why is this film special because it is perfect example childhood caught film i dont think there is anyone who could watch it without thinking that it rings true every piece film that deals with similar subject falls behind this one only one that i can think that comes anywhere near is federico fellinis amarcord jean vigos zero conduct is also very interesting probably influenced this film lot i know truffaut was familiar with it but that may not have been until after this film came out antoine doinel is such endearing character i hope that sometime soon i can procure see his other filmic exploits i really need see more truffaut general im far behind with him well 400 blows deserves 10 10 no doubt it is easily one best films ever made one those films that any knowledgable person would include it list films that are absolutely necessary student film,0.5047585747585747,0.20515651015651018,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.28}"

Truffaut shows his mastery of the cinema in this, his freshman attempt.The film is perfectly cast with Dionel relaying neutral facial expressions for the majority of the film. The boy, although not necessarily evoking sympathy from the audience, definitely evokes empathy. He is a pathetic character forced into his position by his teacher and his almost uncaring mother.Throughout the film, Truffaut hints at the possibility of a happy life for the protagonist, but just as soon as the ideal is given to us, it is taken away.

As a French,I'm stunned when I see the popularity of this good ,but by no means outstanding film. 1.It's not the first film of the ""nouvelle vague"" move;check Agnes Varda's ""la pointe courte"",(1956)Alain Resnais's ""Hiroshima mon amour""(1958),Claude Chabrol's ""le beau serge""(1958) are anterior .Historically,""les 400 coups "" comes after. 2.The ""nouvelle vague"" was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors:Overnight,Julien Duvivier,Henri-George Clouzot,Claude Autant-Lara ,Yves allégret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion.THis selfishness and this contempt is typically ""nouvelle vague"".You 've never heard (or read) the great generation of the thirties (Renoir,Carné,Grémillon,Duvivier already,Feyder) laugh at ,say,Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder.So,thanks to Truffaut and co,some people will never discover some gems of the French fifties or forties(Duvuvier's ""sous le ciel de Paris"",Autant-Lara's ""douce"",Yves Allégret's ""une si jolie petite plage "" and ""manèges"").THe novelle vague clique went as far as saying that William Wyler,Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann were worthless! 3.""Les 400 coups "" is technically rather disappointing:it's very academic ,the story is as linear as it can be,the teachers are caricatures,and the mother Claire Maurier delivers such memorable lines as (you've got to be a French circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is): Well ,your father 's got only his brevet (junior school diploma)and,as for me ,I've got only my high school diploma!You've got to know,that circa 1960,hardly 10%of the pupils had the HSD in France! Antoine Doinel should have been proud of his mother after all!She wants him to have diplomas,who can blame her? 4.Compared to the innovations of ""Hiroshima mon amour"",which features a brand new form,and a new ""fragmented "" content,""les 400 coups "" pales into significance.Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior ""Jules and Jim"", helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau. 5.The interpretation is rather stiff;Jean-Pierre Léaud ,arguably listenable when dubbed in English ,is still decent,but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation. 6.The topic=stolen childhood had better days,before (Julien Duvivier's ""Poil de carotte"" ,Luis Bunuel's ""los olvidados"") and will have after (Maurice Pialat's ""l'enfance nue"",Kenneth Loach's ""Kes"") I do not want to demean Truffaut,his movie is not bad,but,frankly,French movie buffs,prefer ""Jules and Jim"" ""l'enfant sauvage"" (a film honest ,true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault)""l'argent de poche""(as academic as ""400 coups"" but much more funny)or his nice Hitchcock pastiche ""vivement dimanche"".",living wild life,this film aka four hundred blows is mistranslation faire les 400 coups means live wild life as french im stunned when i see popularity this good but by no means outstanding film 1 its not first film nouvelle vague move check agnes vardas la pointe courte 1956 alain resnaiss hiroshima mon amour 1958 claude chabrols le beau serge 1958 are anterior historically les 400 coups comes after 2 nouvelle vague was sometimes ponderous hard their predecessors overnight julien duvivier henri george clouzot claude autant lara yves all gret lot others were doomed oblivion this selfishness this contempt is typically nouvelle vague you ve never heard or read great generation thirties renoir carn gr millon duvivier already feyder laugh at say maurice tourneur or max linder so thanks truffaut co some people will never discover some gems french fifties or forties duvuviers sous le ciel de paris autant laras douce yves all grets une si jolie petite plage man ges novelle vague clique went as far as saying that william wyler georges stevens fred zinemann were worthless 3 les 400 coups is technically rather disappointing its very academic story is as linear as it can be teachers are caricatures mother claire maurier delivers such memorable lines as youve got be french circa 1960 understand how ridiculous it is well your father s got only his brevet junior school diploma as me ive got only my high school diploma youve got know that circa 1960 hardly 10 pupils had hsd france antoine doinel should have been proud his mother after all she wants him have diplomas who can blame her 4 compared innovations hiroshima mon amour which features brand new form new fragmented content les 400 coups pales into significance truffaut will master new form only with highly superior jules jim helped by incomparable jeanne moreau 5 interpretation is rather stiff jean pierre l aud arguably listenable when dubbed english is still decent but he will soon degenerate into most affected his generation 6 topic stolen childhood had better days before julien duviviers poil de carotte luis bunuels los olvidados will have after maurice pialats lenfance nue kenneth loachs kes i do not want demean truffaut his movie is not bad but frankly french movie buffs prefer jules jim lenfant sauvage film honest true commercially uncompromizing fault largent de poche as academic as 400 coups but much more funny or his nice hitchcock pastiche vivement dimanche,0.5156346483704973,0.09621702197173894,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
7.0,All you need is love,"The title of the film is The 400 Blows but it is actually an expression for 'Raising Hell.'Made in 1959 in a cinema verite style. This is the full screen debut of Francois Truffaut and an example of the French New Wave. It was a critical hit.Jean-Pierre Leaud plays Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood teenager in Paris who constantly gets into trouble at school and an at home. Doinel is based partly on Truffaut himself.Doinel finds school boring, does not get on with his teachers who usually catch him telling lies including an embarrassing one where in a panic he tells that one of his parent has died.At home he is alone a lot as both of his parents are working. His glamorous mother (Claire Maurier) seems to have little time for him. He gets on better with his father (Albert Remy) who is more playful but as the film progresses, he is actually the step-father and you also learn that his mother is having an affair.Doinel wants love but his step- father seems too weak (he suspects his wife is cheating) his mother too busy but he seems happiest when she does give him attention such as towelling him down after a bath.Doinel and his best friend Rene get into all sorts of scrapes and petty crime. Several times Doinel runs away from home and sleeps rough.He gets caught stealing a typewriter from his stepfather's workplace and comes into the attention of the police, social services and the judiciary. At the end he is sent to a young offender's institute that he also runs away from and onto a beach to what looks like an uncertain future.However Truffaut would re-visit Doinel over the course of his directing career.Watching this film it becomes apparent how much this influenced the British New Wave in the 1960s. So much of this film reminded me of Kes by Ken Loach with its naturalistic acting styles.Just look at the mischievous scene where the sports teacher takes the class for a walk around the streets of Paris and the kids disappear few at a time. Then there is the very naturalistic scene at the Punch & Judy show where the much younger kids are enjoying themselves.The city is a playground but when Doinel is living rough it is also oppressive and scary.Of course as time has gone on the shock value of the out of control adolescent has been lost with newer, more franker films.The French New Wave also had a different way of telling stories in the cinema that someone like me brought up on a diet of junk Hollywood blockbusters might not always appreciate. The film can be a little too wayward and loose.However the final freeze frame of a boy fulfilling his dream of seeing the sea but still alone and lost is regarded as a classic.

7.0,Well made but the story just didn't grab me,"François Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" is routinely listed as one of the greatest films in all of foreign cinema. At the time of its release it was hailed as an important film and subsequently proved to be immensely influential in the context of the French New Wave.The semi-autobiographical story concerns a Parisian adolescent (Jean-Pierre Léaud) who attempts to escape problems at home and at school by delving into a life of petty crime. Unfortunately, he never receives more than a temporary respite from his predicament and frequently ends up deeper in trouble. The script is fairly loose and strives for realism above all else.Enforcing Truffaut's aim of realism is the group of actors that he assembled. Léaud indisputably carries the film, at once delivering an authentic performance while also showing a maturity beyond his years. While not quite as impressive, the supporting cast is nevertheless uniformly solid, perhaps none moreso than Guy Decomble as Antoine's antagonist at school.Truffaut's direction is exceedingly well-handled, not to mention impressive for a debut feature. The film also sports attractive cinematography and a lively score by Jean Constantin.Indeed, the film can scarcely be faulted for any flaw in its construction or execution. Instead, my tempered enthusiasm is the result of feeling a certain amount of detachment from the main character. Naturally, this sort of objection is largely personal so your mileage may vary.",well made but story just didnt grab me,fran ois truffauts 400 blows is routinely listed as one greatest films all foreign cinema at time its release it was hailed as important film subsequently proved be immensely influential context french new wave semi autobiographical story concerns parisian adolescent jean pierre l aud who attempts escape problems at home at school by delving into life petty crime unfortunately he never receives more than temporary respite his predicament frequently ends up deeper trouble script is fairly loose strives realism above all else enforcing truffauts aim realism is group actors that he assembled l aud indisputably carries film at once delivering authentic performance while also showing maturity beyond his years while not quite as impressive supporting cast is nevertheless uniformly solid perhaps none moreso than guy decomble as antoines antagonist at school truffauts direction is exceedingly well handled not mention impressive debut feature film also sports attractive cinematography lively score by jean constantin indeed film can scarcely be faulted any flaw its construction or execution instead my tempered enthusiasm is result feeling certain amount detachment main character naturally this sort objection is largely personal so your mileage may vary,0.4881415251415252,0.24607026307026306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10.0,French cinema at its best,"Truffaut has worked wonders here, creating a masterful tale of a boy confused, troubled, and unloved. Antoine Doinel (played superbly by Jean-Pierre Léaud in the lead role) has strict, unfaithful parents, and a harsh, oppressive teacher, and falls into delinquency because of his unhappiness. He lies, steals, skips school and runs away from home, and soon ends up in a juvenile delinquency centre.Truffaut's inspiration for this film came from his own depressed childhood, so he bases Antoine on himself, including in terms of appearance. Being a 'New Wave' (a cinematographic movement of the sixties, involving directors who believed Hollywood films were too lavish and unreal) director, Truffaut always used a real location for the film, including breathtaking shots of Truffaut's native Paris. He also made a cameo in the film in the style of Hitchcock.Delinquance is the key theme here. Antoine, who is a character who believes in liberty and freedom, and the way he is always locked up is repressive for him, and this provokes a constant need for him to be out.Trying to make a realistic and moving film was Truffaut's aim, which, by watching this film, I realised that he had done amazingly well. Also, by combining humour and drama too, we have the defining French film of the 20th century. A black and white film that is full of colour.

,Real Fiction,"Spoilers herein.With this film began an experiment that was to ultimately fail after dozens of notable films. It was much like the experiment in art nouveau in architecture seventy years earlier. I suppose that every art has cycles which begin with a collapse of the passion in artifice and a resulting call to the spontaneously natural.In this case, we have a camera acting as a selfaware human voyeur. There is no story: we simply enter and leave one life at arbitrary points. There is no drama, instead the `natural' drama of life. There are in fact none of the theatrics traditionally used to exaggerate so that things convey as real. The philosophy here is that REAL is real.Seeing this film again after my first viewing 35 years ago shocks me at the naivete of both Truffaut and myself then. I still celebrate nature, but I no longer believe it can be found in a zoo, where someone like Truffault can walk me through, pointing out what he thinks is interesting.Film, I believe, is something new still. Something that is beginning to change the way we conceptualize the most basic elements of life. Our bodies have stopped evolving, and that evolution has shifted to the level of tropes -- some in visual grammar -- that act selfishly to embed and promote themselves. Part of their defense is to periodically prompt us to believe that film is a mere window to reality. But that notion always collapses.This film is important because one can trace that collapse of induced naivete from its beginning here to an end.

7.0,Wild Child,"Francois Truffaut's first feature, and like many first features it's semi-autobiographical. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. As Joyce advised, ""Wipe your glosses with what you know."" There are only two cautions to be observed. One is that your first story, about yourself, doesn't turn you into a moral paragon. The second is that, having gotten that initial material out of your system, you have the industry and talent to go on to other things -- not necessarily less personal, but less heavily invested. Truffaut managed to rise well above his beginnings.Jean-Pierre Leaud is the boy of about twelve who lives in a shabby and cramped apartment in Paris with a mother who, though she sometimes tries her best to act otherwise, doesn't really want him and never has. Leaud's father doesn't mind the kid, but things are tough. Both parents work. The mother is being unfaithful and the father is distant.So Leaud begins to get into trouble at school. (And what a run-down, working-class school it is.) He writes graffiti, gets caught, gets punished, but seems to learn nothing from it, nor from forging a note excusing his absence by claiming that his mother has died. He winds up running away from home, stealing a typewriter, getting caught, and sent to an ""observation camp"" where he's subject to tough love and interviews by a social worker. He runs away from the camp too and the last scene is of Leaud chugging along a wide strand, splashing through the tiny waves of icy sea water.Truffaut doesn't give Leaud easy excuses. He's gone through tribulations, certainly, but so have many of the other kids in his class. And at least Leaud wasn't sexually abused as a child -- the kiss of death in movies these days. But his story isn't one of a born delinquent either. He takes no pleasure in destroying things or in hurting or disappointing others. He exploits nobody.And the parents themselves aren't evil or weak. Their foibles are recognizably human. His parents only rarely indulge him but they never beat him. The boy may live in a bare apartment with cracked walls and not enough furniture or heat, but so do his mother and father, so they're subject to the same physical stressors.In fact, there's nobody in the whole movie who is entirely evil or entirely good, despite the fact that the film is in black and white.There is a vein of comedy in it too. Their language teacher is trying to get them to pronounce English correctly. ""Where is the girl?"", he asks one student in clear and precise tones. ""At the bitch,"" replies the student, and the teacher explodes in a volcano of insults in French -- and he stutters! Overall, what you're most likely to get out of this film is a sense of Truffaut's abiding pity for the human condition. Take the Punch and Judy show that we see a couple of dozen young kids watching. The camera pans slowly across their faces, and we see them laughing and yelling -- and we see their misshapen heads, their diminutive chins, their crossed eyes, and those ears that kids of that age tend to have, like African elephants sticking out from their skulls, all ready to flap with excitement. You have to love kids to love that kind of ugliness.The style is grainy and documentary with only occasional touches of art that are noticeable enough to call attention to themselves. Two kids sit on a bench in a wintry garden and talk about their hated parents while the camera deliberately lifts itself to a syrupy statue above them in which a loving mother is kissing a cherub.And that last shot -- a freeze frame of Leaud on the beach at the end of his tether, unable to go forward into the sea, unable to retreat to the camp he's just escaped from. The image is still and Leaud is captured staring into the camera lens, waiting, as it were, for the audience to judge him. We, the jury.Truffaut was one of the New Wave of French directors, most of them formerly critics for a French magazine. (They gave us the term ""film noir."") Jean-Luc Goddard was another. But I think Truffaut leaves Goddard in the dust. Goddard is far more fashionable because of his on-screen pyrotechnics. He up-ended the grammar of film, as if to say, ""Look at me, Ma!"" What he did to editing alone was what Sinead O'Connor did to the Pope's photo. And he was political in the right way for the time. But he lacks Truffaut's essential humanity or, let's be honest, his humility. Maybe it's just me but compassion seems a more evolved emotion than aggression. I wonder if Truffaut ever read Rousseau.",wild child,francois truffauts first feature like many first features its semi autobiographical well theres nothing wrong with that as joyce advised wipe your glosses with what you know there are only two cautions be observed one is that your first story about yourself doesnt turn you into moral paragon second is that having gotten that initial material out your system you have industry talent go other things not necessarily less personal but less heavily invested truffaut managed rise well above his beginnings jean pierre leaud is boy about twelve who lives shabby cramped apartment paris with mother who though she sometimes tries her best act otherwise doesnt really want him never has leauds father doesnt mind kid but things are tough both parents work mother is being unfaithful father is distant so leaud begins get into trouble at school what run down working class school it is he writes graffiti gets caught gets punished but seems learn nothing it nor forging note excusing his absence by claiming that his mother has died he winds up running away home stealing typewriter getting caught sent observation camp where hes subject tough love interviews by social worker he runs away camp too last scene is leaud chugging along wide strand splashing through tiny waves icy sea water truffaut doesnt give leaud easy excuses hes gone through tribulations certainly but so have many other kids his class at least leaud wasnt sexually abused as child kiss death movies these days but his story isnt one born delinquent either he takes no pleasure destroying things or hurting or disappointing others he exploits nobody parents themselves arent evil or weak their foibles are recognizably human his parents only rarely indulge him but they never beat him boy may live bare apartment with cracked walls not enough furniture or heat but so do his mother father so theyre subject same physical stressors fact theres nobody whole movie who is entirely evil or entirely good despite fact that film is black white there is vein comedy it too their language teacher is trying get them pronounce english correctly where is girl he asks one student clear precise tones at bitch replies student teacher explodes volcano insults french he stutters overall what youre most likely get out this film is sense truffauts abiding pity human condition take punch judy show that we see couple dozen young kids watching camera pans slowly across their faces we see them laughing yelling we see their misshapen heads their diminutive chins their crossed eyes those ears that kids that age tend have like african elephants sticking out their skulls all ready flap with excitement you have love kids love that kind ugliness style is grainy documentary with only occasional touches art that are noticeable enough call attention themselves two kids sit bench wintry garden talk about their hated parents while camera deliberately lifts itself syrupy statue above them which loving mother is kissing cherub that last shot freeze frame leaud beach at end his tether unable go forward into sea unable retreat camp hes just escaped image is still leaud is captured staring into camera lens waiting as it were audience judge him we jury truffaut was one new wave french directors most them formerly critics french magazine they gave us term film noir jean luc goddard was another but i think truffaut leaves goddard dust goddard is far more fashionable because his screen pyrotechnics he up ended grammar film as if say look at me ma what he did editing alone was what sinead oconnor did popes photo he was political right way time but he lacks truffauts essential humanity or lets be honest his humility maybe its just me but compassion seems more evolved emotion than aggression i wonder if truffaut ever read rousseau,0.41049932312818915,0.02562089971883786,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7.0,It's well made but it won't be on any of my top-lists.,"It's of course ridicules to call this movie a bad one but as far as so called new wave French movies go, this isn't the best example of it, in my opinion.Can't really see how people can call this one of the most powerful and emotional drama's ever made, unless you perhaps had a tough youth yourself and can identify yourself with its young main character. Perhaps it's also due to the fact that it is of course being placed in a totally different time period, at also a different country and culture but personally I couldn't really place myself in his shoes because throughout the movie he's doing some things that I can't see myself ever doing or saying to someone.But this is perhaps also one of the powers of the movie, at the same time. It's not showing things and people as just black and white, good or bad but it more shows that nobody is truly a good or a bad person. Sometimes it are certain circumstances that force us to do things in order to 'survive' in this world. Whether or not you like it, you sometimes have to do things you know you're later going to regret.In that regard this is a quite good random slice of life, or a coming of age movie. You could take the movie both these ways really, since it for a change is a movie that entirely focuses on its young main character and tells the entire story from his perspective. It's an original but also risky approach to the genre, that in this case did work out, also really thanks to Jean-Pierre Léaud, who plays the young boy.So it all in all really remains a well put together movie, by François Truffaut, that just didn't really ever got to me at a more emotional level. Extra praise should be send Truffaut's way though, since this movie actually was his first full length movie and he made at a quite a young age as well. Definitely not a bad first movie by him, though thankfully still he and his movies grew better over the years.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",its well made but it wont be any my top lists,its course ridicules call this movie bad one but as far as so called new wave french movies go this isnt best example it my opinion cant really see how people can call this one most powerful emotional dramas ever made unless you perhaps had tough youth yourself can identify yourself with its young main character perhaps its also due fact that it is course being placed totally different time period at also different country culture but personally i couldnt really place myself his shoes because throughout movie hes doing some things that i cant see myself ever doing or saying someone but this is perhaps also one powers movie at same time its not showing things people as just black white good or bad but it more shows that nobody is truly good or bad person sometimes it are certain circumstances that force us do things order survive this world whether or not you like it you sometimes have do things you know youre later going regret that regard this is quite good random slice life or coming age movie you could take movie both these ways really since it change is movie that entirely focuses its young main character tells entire story his perspective its original but also risky approach genre that this case did work out also really thanks jean pierre l aud who plays young boy so it all all really remains well put together movie by fran ois truffaut that just didnt really ever got me at more emotional level extra praise should be send truffauts way though since this movie actually was his first full length movie he made at quite young age as well definitely not bad first movie by him though thankfully still he his movies grew better over years 7 10,0.4448528138528138,0.13156854256854256,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Extraordiany Portrait Of A Parisian Youth - One Of The All Time Greats,"In viewing François Truffaut's The 400 Blows for perhaps the fifth time, I finally began to realize its true greatness. Inspired by the director's childhood, The 400 Blows (Truffaut's first film) is primarily about a young boy growing up with his mother and stepfather in Paris and apparently heading into a life of crime. Most adults see the boy as a troublemaker, but in the film, he is meant to be the protagonist.Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is the boy's name. He is resourceful, quiet, and does what he can to get by. At home, he has a struggling relationship with his parents, especially his mother. She is a woman of curious interests, always distracted by her incommodious son and a secret affair with a man from her job. Antoine's stepfather appears nice enough while treating his son as an equal in a good manner, although he is not really attached to him. However, both parents share common traits: they are away from home quite a bit and do not pay close enough attention to their son. Sadly enough, they only judge him by his behavior and by reports they get from other people.At school, Antoine's teacher classifies him as a menacing troublemaker. Not that it is entirely Antoine's fault, he just has terrible luck. In the opening scene of the film, we see a poster with a half-naked woman on the front being passed around quietly by the students. The teacher is sitting at his desk with his head down, grading papers, until the poster comes to Antoine and he finds it. He sends Antoine to the corner of the room, where he writes a note of resentment on the wall. As punishment for that, he is to diagram the exact words that he wrote. At home that night, Antoine's homework is interrupted. Because he did not complete it, his good friend René convinces him to skip school the next day, although Antoine is reluctant at first. They walk around France and notice Antoine's mother kissing a man that is not her husband. She and her son make eye contact, but René assures his friend that everything will be alright. The next morning, as the boys return to school, Antoine lies to his teacher and says the reason he missed school was that his mother died. Everything is alright until his mother, furious, arrives at school and her son is immediately identified as a liar.And yet, we see Antoine alone at home in some private, subtle, and hopeful moments. One of them being, his love for Balzac. He adores him, and we see him reading his biography and lighting a candle in a shrine in his honor at home. One day, at school, the students are proposed to write an essay on an important event in their life, and Antoine chooses the topic of his grandfather's death, in which he incorporates a phrase from his Balzac book. Alas, the teacher identifies this as plagiarism, and sends Antoine out of the classroom, along with René. The two boys stay at René's house for quite some time, living up to the expectations of a life of crime, until they steal a typewriter leaving Antoine caught trying to return it. He is later sent to a juvenile delinquent detention home.The 400 Blows is not meant to be a tragedy. Rather, it is a character study following Antoine Doinel's life and decisions he makes as a direct result of the many things going on in it. Even The 400 Blows captures a few moments of happiness joy. One of these is a priceless sequence in which a gym teacher is leading Antoine's class for a jog through Paris, not realizing that the boys are peeling off and running away two by two. There is another scene after Antoine's shrine for Balzac catches on fire and his parents are stressing and yelling at him. His mother suggests an outing to a movie theater, where they end up going. After the film, we see the trio in the car, laughing and reflecting on what they had seen. We see this as a moment of hope for Antoine and his family, for this being the only time they are all happy together.There are many poignant moments however, emerging late in the film after Antoine is caught for stealing the typewriter. His father is fed up with his behavior and escorts him to a police station where he is sent to a jail cell and later in a police wagon full of prostitutes and thieves, with his face peering through the bars, full of tears. His parents discuss with the authorities that they cannot not take him back because they believe he will only run away again. So, in turn, their son is taken to the juvenile delinquent school. These sequences express a reality of Antoine's life, in tune with the outcome of himself. He remains quiet and reserved towards the end of the film, as if he has nothing to say. The story of Antoine Doinel and his many experiences allow a life to be filled with curiosity and exploration. Every second of the ninety-nine minutes of the film is not wasted. Truffaut allows every minute to be overflowing with creativity while still maintaining the central story of the protagonist. It is not a film that can be taken lightly as a family movie to be watched every Saturday night. It is a film to be given plenty of thought, carefully examined, and given a conclusion. The genius of the film does not rely on that, moreover, it relies on how much is put into the film. Down to the smallest detail, the film is able to maneuver and progress. The story contains elements of sadness, regret, family, warmth, happiness, humor, values, and choices.

It is a magnet - wherever you go you move towards it - and a totem. This sequence is transposed later, when Antoine goes to the funfair, and rides on one of those moving cylinders, like a zoetrope. The comparison is deliberate - Truffaut is situating his film in film history, declaring his intention to start again, to get back to first principles, to a time when moving pictures was a medium of possibility, before it was bogged down by genre and the studio system. this zoetrope has a transformative power - it takes a character from neo-realism and abstracts him, turning him into a figure in a Grand Guignol, crawling in eternal circles. But, from his point of view, it completely transforms the outside world, from a thing of oppressive solidity content to stare in powerful distance, to a formless, unstable mass. This sequence crystallises the power of Truffaut's film, its freedom and its concern with entrapment. It charts the decline into imprisonment of its main character with a style of buoyant liberation. So while Antoine is trapped in this barrel, he is also offered a new way of looking beyond those merely content to look on from the outside.'The 400 Blows' is the first masterpiece of the nouvelle vague, that iconoclastic movement that briefly saved cinema from stagnation as an art-form, just as it declared that it was an art-form (hmm, a connection?). It's a cliche now that Truffaut was the least innovative of the New Wavers, and yet it's still surprising that a film built so classically (moving from Paris to the countryside; balancing the opening school scene, with its barred doors, with the closing borstal scene etc.) still achieves that tingling spontaneity so rare in the cinema (e.g. Jean-Pierre Leaud as an actor laughing with the crew as Albert Remy breaks an egg). The first viewing of '400' is such a rush you'd be forgiven for thinking that it, like 'A Bout de souffle', was made up on the spot, and it is only on subsequent viewings that you marvel at Truffaut's formal control, the rhythm of his camera movements and editing, the consideration of his compositions. That image of spinning round a fixed pole is the one that haunts me. Just as the decline of Michel Poiccard in the Truffaut-scripted 'A Bout de souffle' is figured as a car running out of steam, so Antoine is forever running in circles, brought back to a fixed point, having gotten nowhere. To move is to live - that is why the final freeze-frame is so frightening: Antoine has usurped the Eiffel Tower, has become the centre of the spinning top - he dominates the closing frame, just as the opening ones were empty (of humans). But at what cost? - has he simply wound down into inertia?: the subsequent Doinel films would suggest so. (that closing beach scene, in which Antoine seems to be running against moving, phosphorescent sand, also alludes to another great work about a young artist and his city, Joyce's 'Ulysses' and its chapter 'Proteus')Although the film rarely shoots directly from his point of view, the style is an exuberant expression of Antoine's sensibility. Antoine is ambisexual, still seeking his identity, just before seeking sexuality - early on he sits at his mother's dressing table, his face splintered by the triptych mirrors; later he steals supplies from the ladies' toilet. This embodying of subjectivity in objective style is what saves the closing third from de Sica-like sentimentality and manipulation: we are rarely outside Antoine's head, people are wonderful or horrible as he experiences them. Only twice is his sensibility intruded on - when he is caught bringing back the typewriter, the captor creeping his point of view; and the interview with the faceless psychologist at the borstal, filmed as if behind a double-sided mirror, the feral animal penned at last.'The 400 blows' is revered as a moving, melancholy picture of misdirected adolescence. It is sometimes forgotten that most of the film is pure comedy, delighting in gags, digressions, bits of business. For much of the running time, you envy Antoine - what joy it must be to be young and in Paris, swashbuckling in the schoolyard, truanting in the city, smoking cigars: his family situation is no worse that most, at least he has friends, a roof over his head, and can read Balzac. Antoine is a bit of a clown: all clowns eventually settle down, make the right choices at crucial moments in their lives. Antoine somehow misses those rarely visible choices and finds himself locked up, descending the various levels of institutional hell. His often amiable and/or witty parents are no more evil than he is a saint, although an educational system that asks kids to simply copy down 'great' poems (a Sisyphean task in one ink-blotted case) is clearly wrong. Georges Delerue's score - romantic, exuberant, tragic, bittersweet - ranks with the three greats ('Vertigo', 'Taxi Driver', 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg').",we need films like this today desperately possible spoilers,400 blows immediately introduces its hero breathless credit sequence i mean eiffel tower glimpsed different angles as camera drives through streets paris emerging behind buildings through trees opening onto avenues it is magnet wherever you go you move towards it totem this sequence is transposed later when antoine goes funfair rides one those moving cylinders like zoetrope comparison is deliberate truffaut is situating his film film history declaring his intention start again get back first principles time when moving pictures was medium possibility before it was bogged down by genre studio system this zoetrope has transformative power it takes character neo realism abstracts him turning him into figure grand guignol crawling eternal circles but his point view it completely transforms outside world thing oppressive solidity content stare powerful distance formless unstable mass this sequence crystallises power truffauts film its freedom its concern with entrapment it charts decline into imprisonment its main character with style buoyant liberation so while antoine is trapped this barrel he is also offered new way looking beyond those merely content look outside 400 blows is first masterpiece nouvelle vague that iconoclastic movement that briefly saved cinema stagnation as art form just as it declared that it was art form hmm connection its cliche now that truffaut was least innovative new wavers yet its still surprising that film built so classically moving paris countryside balancing opening school scene with its barred doors with closing borstal scene etc still achieves that tingling spontaneity so rare cinema e g jean pierre leaud as actor laughing with crew as albert remy breaks egg first viewing 400 is such rush youd be forgiven thinking that it like bout de souffle was made up spot it is only subsequent viewings that you marvel at truffauts formal control rhythm his camera movements editing consideration his compositions that image spinning round fixed pole is one that haunts me just as decline michel poiccard truffaut scripted bout de souffle is figured as car running out steam so antoine is forever running circles brought back fixed point having gotten nowhere move is live that is why final freeze frame is so frightening antoine has usurped eiffel tower has become centre spinning top he dominates closing frame just as opening ones were empty humans but at what cost has he simply wound down into inertia subsequent doinel films would suggest so that closing beach scene which antoine seems be running against moving phosphorescent sand also alludes another great work about young artist his city joyces ulysses its chapter proteus although film rarely shoots directly his point view style is exuberant expression antoines sensibility antoine is ambisexual still seeking his identity just before seeking sexuality early he sits at his mothers dressing table his face splintered by triptych mirrors later he steals supplies ladies toilet this embodying subjectivity objective style is what saves closing third de sica like sentimentality manipulation we are rarely outside antoines head people are wonderful or horrible as he experiences them only twice is his sensibility intruded when he is caught bringing back typewriter captor creeping his point view interview with faceless psychologist at borstal filmed as if behind double sided mirror feral animal penned at last 400 blows is revered as moving melancholy picture misdirected adolescence it is sometimes forgotten that most film is pure comedy delighting gags digressions bits business much running time you envy antoine what joy it must be be young paris swashbuckling schoolyard truanting city smoking cigars his family situation is no worse that most at least he has friends roof over his head can read balzac antoine is bit clown all clowns eventually settle down make right choices at crucial moments their lives antoine somehow misses those rarely visible choices finds himself locked up descending various levels institutional hell his often amiable or witty parents are no more evil than he is saint although educational system that asks kids simply copy down great poems sisyphean task one ink blotted case is clearly wrong georges delerues score romantic exuberant tragic bittersweet ranks with three greats vertigo taxi driver umbrellas cherbourg,0.4715938799762328,0.04126708259061201,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,Not a timeless classic as hyped but still good....,"Watching ""The Bicycle Thieves"" earlier this year, the same expectation was made through this French classic as both had child artists in its center and both explored Europe in the post War era. ""The 400 Blows"" is on disturbed childhood which resorts to petty crimes following the indifference from the parents. It delves into child psychology and remains engaging for most of the time. It is highly structured in its narration with a nice flow maintained aside a beautiful portrayal of Paris streets it captures.But overall it has its disappointments which gives reservations to place it in the position of ""The Bicycle Thieves."" First of all the film ends inconclusive. It raises some issues on childhood problems concerning the schools and families, which isn't resolved. The problems raised feel single dimensional and on its way fails to make a compelling watch though technically it feels flawless along few endearing performances to admire.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",not timeless classic as hyped but still good,watching bicycle thieves earlier this year same expectation was made through this french classic as both had child artists its center both explored europe post war era 400 blows is disturbed childhood which resorts petty crimes following indifference parents it delves into child psychology remains engaging most time it is highly structured its narration with nice flow maintained aside beautiful portrayal paris streets it captures but overall it has its disappointments which gives reservations place it position bicycle thieves first all film ends inconclusive it raises some issues childhood problems concerning schools families which isnt resolved problems raised feel single dimensional its way fails make compelling watch though technically it feels flawless along few endearing performances admire rating 2 stars out 4,0.3929978354978354,0.2146320346320346,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.4}"
6.0,one of the most extraordinary and wondrous scenes I have ever seen.,"There is within this film one of the most extraordinary and wondrous scenes I have ever seen. For no particular reason (like much of the film) there is suddenly the depiction of a puppet show of Little Red Riding Hood with a very large audience of children. We cut between the violent action and the children's faces as they watch. Spellbound, we see them giggling as children do, then looking frightened, then relieved but then perplexed and turning to their friends, then themselves spellbound by the magical scenes and scared and amused and relieved all over again. The force of the feeling that we are truly relating to the kids before us is for the brief duration of the minute or so of celluloid is amazing. One wishes, of course that the rest of the film was the same. There are other sequences of note but for the most part I was so uninterested in the various activities of stupid children and even more stupid adults that my exasperation was almost too painful to endure as the stupidity of the institutions is finally revealed. Never a fan of Truffault I was prompted to see this (for the first time!) after seeing the boy in the lead, Jean-Pierre Leaud who I had watched recently as an adult play film director in Olivier Assayas' Irma Vep (1996). Not sure I should have bothered.",one most extraordinary wondrous scenes i have ever seen,there is within this film one most extraordinary wondrous scenes i have ever seen no particular reason like much film there is suddenly depiction puppet show little red riding hood with very large audience children we cut between violent action childrens faces as they watch spellbound we see them giggling as children do then looking frightened then relieved but then perplexed turning their friends then themselves spellbound by magical scenes scared amused relieved all over again force feeling that we are truly relating kids before us is brief duration minute or so celluloid is amazing one wishes course that rest film was same there are other sequences note but most part i was so uninterested various activities stupid children even more stupid adults that my exasperation was almost too painful endure as stupidity institutions is finally revealed never fan truffault i was prompted see this first time after seeing boy lead jean pierre leaud who i had watched recently as adult play film director olivier assayas irma vep 1996 not sure i should have bothered,0.6119321291735085,0.025841543513957323,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,A very relaxed and natural look at growing up in the life of Antonie,"Antonie Doinel is a typical young boy living in Paris. His mother and father are rather distant and pay him little attention when he is around the house. Fed up with school he decides to just skive off and spend the day hanging around, playing with his friends in the local theme park. It is while he is doing this that he spies his mother kissing someone other than his father. This marks the start of a chain of events that see him getting into more trouble both at home and at school.Although I have written a rough plot summary, I must note that I think this film is more about Antonie than it is any more traditional narrative. The film follows Antonie through the troubles he has in his young life, always painting him as a realistic character  never too simplistic so as to be totally likable (what child is!?) but not a brat like some kids are in American movies. This is crucial to the film because it is so observational that it could almost be a documentary due to its style. This is down to the natural direction from Truffaut, a skill that is only helped by his excellent use of the locations, in particular the streets of Paris. Although his story is extreme in its fate, it is still engaging and touching to see Antonie's story and be involved in his young struggles  whether it be school, distant parents or a lack of direction in life. The complex feelings around this time are well delivered, right down to the ambiguous ending where we are not told how Antonie actually feels.The playing from Leaud is excellent and I only wish that more child actors would be like him; natural, confident, vulnerable and convincing in front of the camera. He is well supported by people like Remy, Maurier, Decomble and Flamant but the film is his and I was very impressed by his performance. Of course, aside from him the other star is Truffaut himself and (as well as a cameo) his direction is great, natural, intimate and painting a convincing world for this story to occur within.Overall this is a small little film that succeeds in making the life of Antonie be very interesting and engaging. The plot may require the story to go beyond the day-to-day experiences of most of us did at that age but it is still emotionally involving thanks to a great combination of a superb and natural performance from Leaud, the direction of Truffaut and the great use of locations throughout.",very relaxed natural look at growing up life antonie,antonie doinel is typical young boy living paris his mother father are rather distant pay him little attention when he is around house fed up with school he decides just skive off spend day hanging around playing with his friends local theme park it is while he is doing this that he spies his mother kissing someone other than his father this marks start chain events that see him getting into more trouble both at home at school although i have written rough plot summary i must note that i think this film is more about antonie than it is any more traditional narrative film follows antonie through troubles he has his young life always painting him as realistic character never too simplistic so as be totally likable what child is but not brat like some kids are american movies this is crucial film because it is so observational that it could almost be documentary due its style this is down natural direction truffaut skill that is only helped by his excellent use locations particular streets paris although his story is extreme its fate it is still engaging touching see antonies story be involved his young struggles whether it be school distant parents or lack direction life complex feelings around this time are well delivered right down ambiguous ending where we are not told how antonie actually feels playing leaud is excellent i only wish that more child actors would be like him natural confident vulnerable convincing front camera he is well supported by people like remy maurier decomble flamant but film is his i was very impressed by his performance course aside him other star is truffaut himself as well as cameo his direction is great natural intimate painting convincing world this story occur within overall this is small little film that succeeds making life antonie be very interesting engaging plot may require story go beyond day day experiences most us did at that age but it is still emotionally involving thanks great combination superb natural performance leaud direction truffaut great use locations throughout,0.5167498719918073,0.19623015873015873,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.05, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.48}"
5.0,To face the struggles of life without the needed experience to deal with them,"One of the defining films of its director François Truffaut as well as the French New Wave movement. The latter was a loose term joining together a group of mid-century French film makers that took upon as their goal to talk about current subjects, to experiment with the film medium and to ground it in reality through real locations and modern subject matters.And keeping that in mind, it's easy to see why this film become such a cornerstone for them. It tells about a young Parisian school boy Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), who struggles in every area of his life. His parents heap both scorn and misunderstandings upon him, his school work barely passes muster, and he spends most of his days partaking in minor crimes and misdemeanours. The film doesn't really have a traditional story arc. Doinel doesn't learn that much, his circumstances don't really change. Rather the whole film has the atmosphere of the inevitable in it as Doinel's life slowly spirals deeper and deeper into ruin, culminating in the last haunting shot of him staring directly into the camera on a deserted beach, silently crying for rescue.And yes, the film has a rather gruff feel. It seems like they simply set up the camera, shot the scene and excited the room. Which of course is the ideal of New Wave, but takes some getting used to from a viewer more familiar with mainstream film media.Still, it's a beautiful film in its own way. Personally I appreciate the ideal it represents more than I appreciate it as a stand-alone film, but I'm still glad I saw it.",face struggles life without needed experience deal with them,one defining films its director fran ois truffaut as well as french new wave movement latter was loose term joining together group mid century french film makers that took upon as their goal talk about current subjects experiment with film medium ground it reality through real locations modern subject matters keeping that mind its easy see why this film become such cornerstone them it tells about young parisian school boy antoine doinel jean pierre l aud who struggles every area his life his parents heap both scorn misunderstandings upon him his school work barely passes muster he spends most his days partaking minor crimes misdemeanours film doesnt really have traditional story arc doinel doesnt learn that much his circumstances dont really change rather whole film has atmosphere inevitable it as doinels life slowly spirals deeper deeper into ruin culminating last haunting shot him staring directly into camera deserted beach silently crying rescue yes film has rather gruff feel it seems like they simply set up camera shot scene excited room which course is ideal new wave but takes some getting used viewer more familiar with mainstream film media still its beautiful film its own way personally i appreciate ideal it represents more than i appreciate it as stand alone film but im still glad i saw it,0.451810470231523,0.19374923322291743,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,A masterpiece of French cinema,"Francois Truffaut makes his feature debut with this French masterpiece; the story is largely autobiographical but also shows a grim and authentic of troubled adolescence.

The music just adds to the atmosphere, the direction is superb and the finale is very audacious. The writing is thoughtful and poignant, and this film boasts a superb lead performance.

9.0,The Lost of the Childhood in a Landmark of the Nouvelle Vague,"Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is a fourteen years old boy rejected by his mother and his stepfather, who gave him his name. This lack of affection in his home makes him a rebel, bad student, liar, reckless and stealing objects and money at home. This movie was the first one directed by François Truffault and is a landmark of the Nouvelle Vague, a French style of making films initiated by Truffault and Godard. This movement has produced low budget, but high quality movies, using a small crew, hand camera and free screenplay, with lots of creation and improvisation. The character Antoine is the alter-ego of Truffault. His crimes, watched in the Twentieth-First Century, are minors, but in 1959 were much serious. It is a very good movie, recommended for those who indeed loves cinema.
