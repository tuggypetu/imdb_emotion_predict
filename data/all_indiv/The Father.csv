,A look at dementia from the opposite angle.,"This movie was shot in May 2019 just a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic was recognized. The writer-director says he wrote this with Anthony Hopkins, who was 81, in mind. The movie has a number of well established actors but the story's impact depends on Hopkins and he achieves this as very few might be able to do.Usually movies dealing with aging and dementia depict it from the points of view of all the others around, friends, family members, medical personnel. This does the opposite, it depicts it from the point of view of the afflicted person. As such I found myself totally confused after about 20 minutes but eventually understood why it had to be this way. We are seeing what Anthony (character's name) sees and experiences, the confusion as to where he is and his failure to recognize people he knows.In many ways this is a hard movie to watch because we know people who have gone through dementia and its inevitable end, or know people who are in the early stages of it. For that reason my wife chose not to watch this movie.For the subject matter it is a very good movie.",look at dementia opposite angle,this movie was shot may 2019 just few months before covid 19 pandemic was recognized writer director says he wrote this with anthony hopkins who was 81 mind movie has number well established actors but storys impact depends hopkins he achieves this as very few might be able do usually movies dealing with aging dementia depict it points view all others around friends family members medical personnel this does opposite it depicts it point view afflicted person as such i found myself totally confused after about 20 minutes but eventually understood why it had be this way we are seeing what anthony characters name sees experiences confusion as where he is his failure recognize people he knows many ways this is hard movie watch because we know people who have gone through dementia its inevitable end or know people who are early stages it that reason my wife chose not watch this movie subject matter it is very good movie,0.37875,0.007812499999999986,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,"""I don't know what's happening anymore.""","This movie brings you inside the mind of someone losing their memories and recognition of those around them. In another genre, what happens here could just as well take place in a horror film. The fascinating thing about the story as it unfolds is that as the viewer, there comes a point where you begin to question whether what you're seeing is what the principal character is experiencing, or whether it's a figment of Anthony's (Anthony Hopkins) imagination. The distinction between his reality and the reveries that make up his daily existence sort of blend together in a way that confound the senses. Hopkins is extraordinary in the role, and if this is his last chance to earn an Oscar for Best Actor, then it's a darn good one in a field with some significant competition. Olivia Colman as Anthony's struggling daughter expresses all the concern and frustration that comes with being the primary caregiver for her dementia stricken father, and there are somber moments in the picture when you want to cry along with her over the hopelessness of both his and her situation. As a harbinger of what might happen to anyone as we all approach those senior twilight years, the film can be a depressing experience, only somewhat mitigated by the care and concern that dedicated health care workers are able to provide in an institutional setting. As tender and comforting as the closing scene is, it's one that will break the heart of anyone who's been through a similar experience.",i dont know whats happening anymore,this movie brings you inside mind someone losing their memories recognition those around them another genre what happens here could just as well take place horror film fascinating thing about story as it unfolds is that as viewer there comes point where you begin question whether what youre seeing is what principal character is experiencing or whether its figment anthonys anthony hopkins imagination distinction between his reality reveries that make up his daily existence sort blend together way that confound senses hopkins is extraordinary role if this is his last chance earn oscar best actor then its darn good one field with some significant competition olivia colman as anthonys struggling daughter expresses all concern frustration that comes with being primary caregiver her dementia stricken father there are somber moments picture when you want cry along with her over hopelessness both his her situation as harbinger what might happen anyone as we all approach those senior twilight years film can be depressing experience only somewhat mitigated by care concern that dedicated health care workers are able provide institutional setting as tender comforting as closing scene is its one that will break heart anyone whos been through similar experience,0.5930555555555556,0.28402777777777777,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,So close to perfect and so personal,"This is one of the hardest movie reviews I've ever had to write in my life.Mainly because of the films subject matter, Dementia.I've seen my own father succumb to this dreaded disease and it scares the hell out of my, worse than any horror movie I've watched.I sadly remember some of the last words my own father spoke to me were, ""Be a good boy at School today."" I was 46 at the time.The beauty of ""The Father"" is how Director, Florian Zeller, takes you into this descent of losing your grip on reality through the eyes of the marvellous veteran and Academy Award wining actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins.At times his character Anthony is part Hannibal Lecter and at others a peaceful, but confused ageing Father to Olivia Colmans, Anne.Another Academy Award winner who puts in a highly believable performance as his daughter who's trying to deal with helping a man who refuses to accept assistance from her or carers.Fun Fact: Colman was named Anne is both roles she's been Oscar nominated for.Also great supporting roles form Mark Gatiss, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Rufus Sewell.Overall ""The Father"" has been nominated for 6 Oscars, after already having over 20 wins in other awards and once you've seen this film you'll know why it deserves to win in Hollywood.At 83, Hopkins, is the oldest winner of a Best Male Actor BAFTA and a dark horse to scoop up the big one.This film feels like everything he has learnt in his craft is on display effortlessly for 97 minutes.It's hard to believe this is Zellers' feature film directorial debut, because it's a masterclass in cinema adapted from his own acclaimed play ""Le Pere"" from 2012.The role of Anthony was specifically written for Hopkins.One of the things that got the living legend to agree to this film apart from the top shelf script (adapted by Christopher Hampton) was the inclusion of one of Hopkins favourite pieces of music from Georges Bizet Opera ""The Pearl Fishers"".He's always dreamt of making a movie with this music in it.With lines from Anthony like: ""I feel as if I'm losing all my leaves"" ""The Father"" is so close to perfect I'm giving it 10 stars.",so close perfect so personal,this is one hardest movie reviews ive ever had write my life mainly because films subject matter dementia ive seen my own father succumb this dreaded disease it scares hell out my worse than any horror movie ive watched i sadly remember some last words my own father spoke me were be good boy at school today i was 46 at time beauty father is how director florian zeller takes you into this descent losing your grip reality through eyes marvellous veteran academy award wining actor sir anthony hopkins at times his character anthony is part hannibal lecter at others peaceful but confused ageing father olivia colmans anne another academy award winner who puts highly believable performance as his daughter whos trying deal with helping man who refuses accept assistance her or carers fun fact colman was named anne is both roles shes been oscar nominated also great supporting roles form mark gatiss olivia williams imogen poots rufus sewell overall father has been nominated 6 oscars after already having over 20 wins other awards once youve seen this film youll know why it deserves win hollywood at 83 hopkins is oldest winner best male actor bafta dark horse scoop up big one this film feels like everything he has learnt his craft is display effortlessly 97 minutes its hard believe this is zellers feature film directorial debut because its masterclass cinema adapted his own acclaimed play le pere 2012 role anthony was specifically written hopkins one things that got living legend agree this film apart top shelf script adapted by christopher hampton was inclusion one hopkins favourite pieces music georges bizet opera pearl fishers hes always dreamt making movie with this music it with lines anthony like i feel as if im losing all my leaves father is so close perfect im giving it 10 stars,0.4844827586206896,0.2528735632183908,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,Excellent but deeply upsetting,"I cannot say what I want to say about this film without spoilers, so please don't read on if you want to find what happens in the film as it unfolds.Anthony lives in a flat in London. His daughter Anne calls in on him every day. She is upset and worried because Anthony has driven away another care worker, and Anne is about to move to Paris in a new relationship. Anne's husband indicates that the flat is Anne's, not Anthony's. Anne seems to be an entirely different person,, but then she is Anne again. Her husband is someone different though. Some conversations are repeated. Anthony initially charms, then verbally attacks, Laura, a potential new care worker who reminds him of his other daughter, Lucy, who never comes to see him.We realise early on that Anthony is in the grip of dementia, and through most of the piece, right up to the end, we are wondering hiw much of what we see is real, and how much is Anthony's disintegrating memory betraying him. Ultimately, we never know and it doesn't matter - despite it being very clear how destructive the impact of Anthony's dementia is on Anne (and possibly her busband - was she married? Was it a factor in the marriage breaking up?), what the film shows us is what it might be like inside the mind of someone whose foothold in the real world is increasingly unreliable.Anthony Hopkins wins a well-deserved 2nd Best Actor Oscar for a portrayal of a character who is initially unlikeable but, by the end, is almost literally a little lost boy. The rest of the cast are also excellent.Florian Zeller directs this adaptation of his own play (the adapted screenplay also won an Oscar). It is wise, sad, accurate and compassionate. If you and your family have never been touched by dementia then you may well marvel at the clever and kind telling of a worthwhile story, brought to life by a crew of supremely gifted artists.My family has been touched by dementia on a number of occasions.At different times, I saw in this film my grandparents, my mother-in-law, my wife, my father, my mother, my brother and myself, and all at times in our lives which could never be called happy. It struck very close to home, and I found it brutal.",excellent but deeply upsetting,i cannot say what i want say about this film without spoilers so please dont read if you want find what happens film as it unfolds anthony lives flat london his daughter anne calls him every day she is upset worried because anthony has driven away another care worker anne is about move paris new relationship annes husband indicates that flat is annes not anthonys anne seems be entirely different person but then she is anne again her husband is someone different though some conversations are repeated anthony initially charms then verbally attacks laura potential new care worker who reminds him his other daughter lucy who never comes see him we realise early that anthony is grip dementia through most piece right up end we are wondering hiw much what we see is real how much is anthonys disintegrating memory betraying him ultimately we never know it doesnt matter despite it being very clear how destructive impact anthonys dementia is anne possibly her busband was she married was it factor marriage breaking up what film shows us is what it might be like inside mind someone whose foothold real world is increasingly unreliable anthony hopkins wins well deserved 2nd best actor oscar portrayal character who is initially unlikeable but by end is almost literally little lost boy rest cast are also excellent florian zeller directs this adaptation his own play adapted screenplay also won oscar it is wise sad accurate compassionate if you your family have never been touched by dementia then you may well marvel at clever kind telling worthwhile story brought life by crew supremely gifted artists my family has been touched by dementia number occasions at different times i saw this film my grandparents my mother law my wife my father my mother my brother myself all at times our lives which could never be called happy it struck very close home i found it brutal,0.5484098828001267,0.18945385914898108,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.26}"

10.0,Hopkins has never been better.,"I haven't seen the play on which ""The Father"" is based, (or indeed the other two plays in Florian Zeller's trilogy on the family), but as cinematic adaptations go this is as good as it gets. Taking place almost entirely on a single set, this is an actor's piece of the highest order and its linchpin is a magnificent performance from Anthony Hopkins as ""The Father"" of the title, a man suffering from advanced dementia and perhaps, both in Hopkins's performance and Zeller's treatment of the subject, this will come to be seen as the definitive film on dementia as anyone with personal experience can testify.Everything is seen through Hopkins' eyes. Olivia Coleman, (heartbreakingly good), is his daughter but there are other 'characters' who may or may not exist or rather, if they do exist, who are they or who does Hopkins perceive them to be? A man appears who says he's the daughter's husband but then the daughter has said she does not have a husband. Another woman comes in and says she's his daughter while another man appears and converses with Hopkins. Is he the husband? Is there a husband?I've already said that this is an actor's piece of the first order but it is also a writer's piece with Zeller adapting his own play with Christopher Hampton. It may be mystifying initially for just as characters turn up to confuse us so the film follows no chronological timespans. Events keep repeating themselves if they happen at all until we come to realise we are simply inside Hopkins' dishevelled mind and for Hopkins I think I can safely say that this is a career- best performance. The Oscar givers may ignore it but acting like this deserves more than prizes; it deserves to be seen.",hopkins has never been better,i havent seen play which father is based or indeed other two plays florian zellers trilogy family but as cinematic adaptations go this is as good as it gets taking place almost entirely single set this is actors piece highest order its linchpin is magnificent performance anthony hopkins as father title man suffering advanced dementia perhaps both hopkinss performance zellers treatment subject this will come be seen as definitive film dementia as anyone with personal experience can testify everything is seen through hopkins eyes olivia coleman heartbreakingly good is his daughter but there are other characters who may or may not exist or rather if they do exist who are they or who does hopkins perceive them be man appears who says hes daughters husband but then daughter has said she does not have husband another woman comes says shes his daughter while another man appears converses with hopkins is he husband is there husband ive already said that this is actors piece first order but it is also writers piece with zeller adapting his own play with christopher hampton it may be mystifying initially just as characters turn up confuse us so film follows no chronological timespans events keep repeating themselves if they happen at all until we come realise we are simply inside hopkins dishevelled mind hopkins i think i can safely say that this is career best performance oscar givers may ignore it but acting like this deserves more than prizes it deserves be seen,0.40440476190476193,0.28309523809523807,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.45}"

9.0,The Father Review,"Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance, one of the best in his career, is hard to decide who deserve more the best actor between him and Chadwick Boseman, i know is controversial, but i would vote for Hopkins.Olivia Colman also gives a great performance, showing all the sadness a person would feel in this situation, but Hopkins is the one who elevated the whole material.The ending scene is very emotional and sad, showing once again how amazing is Hopkins performance, when he cries asking for his mother who is obviously dead a long time ago, this just shows even deeper how much he's lost in the time of his own life, the scene also make us see that a person in his condition can feel like a helpless kid who lived a entire life and now is completely lost and confused, sometimes not even capable to remember who he actually is.",father review,anthony hopkins gives amazing performance one best his career is hard decide who deserve more best actor between him chadwick boseman i know is controversial but i would vote hopkins olivia colman also gives great performance showing all sadness person would feel this situation but hopkins is one who elevated whole material ending scene is very emotional sad showing once again how amazing is hopkins performance when he cries asking his mother who is obviously dead long time ago this just shows even deeper how much hes lost time his own life scene also make us see that person his condition can feel like helpless kid who lived entire life now is completely lost confused sometimes not even capable remember who he actually is,0.5805833333333333,0.24541666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10.0,Dementia twists the strands of Anthony's personal multiverse,"Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) is elderly and living in his flat. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) keeps dropping by to check he is OK. But is this right? Strange things keep happening to him, from losing his watch to having strange people turn up at the flat. For Anthony is battling against dementia, and reality and fantasy are not quite as distinct as they once were.Positives: I was one of those disappointed that Chadwick Boseman didn't posthumously win the Best Actor Oscar for ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"". But, boy oh boy, after seeing this I am fully supportive of the Academy's position. Anthony Hopkins has delivered some astonishingly powerful performances during his career - from the tortured ventriloquist in ""Magic"", to Hannibal Lector to the elderly pope in ""The Two Popes"". But he really excels himself here, tapping both your emotions and your sympathies as the confused and terrified old man.The Oscar- and BAFTA-winning screenplay by Florian Zeller, based on his stage play, is devastating, subtly twisting the knife. It will be particularly telling/upsetting for those who are getting on in years and/or have/had elderly parents affected by dementia. I would personally not have included (being deliberately vague) the ""Williams entry"" scene in the trailer, since it is a jolt of a twist in the film. But there are so many other clever devices in the screenplay that you don't see coming. The ending in particular is brutal on the emotions.The production design (an Oscar nomination for Peter Francis and Cathy Featherstone) is ingenious, as the set subtly and progressively transforms. Almost a 'spot the difference' in movie form.The score by Ludovico Einaudi uses atonal strings to great effect, as Anthony's reality keeps shifting from under him.Negatives: I've nothing here, hence my 10/10 rating. I've seen some reviews that have thought that the movie was too ""stagey"" (which is a criticism I have levelled before at a bunch of ""stage to screen"" adaptations such as ""Fences"" and - more recently - ""One Night in Miami"" and ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom""). But I really didn't feel that way about ""The Father"". The claustrophobic nature of the plot was well served I thought by the (largely) single set location.Summary Thoughts on ""The Father"": Dementia is a cruel and heartless disease that robs any affected elderly person of their memories, logic and - ultimately - their dignity. I thought the movie was extremely clever in reflecting this decline, anchored by the astonishing career-best performance from Sir Anthony Hopkins. But this in turns makes this a very hard watch indeed!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. There is also a new onemannsmovies Tiktok channel.

10.0,Anthony Hopkins at the top of his game at 82,"This movie is mind-blowing. Not only does it give you the perspective of a mind that has devolved into dementia, it creatively immerses you in their moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences through the repeating confusing scenes, changing context, strange faces, disappearing furniture, etc. Now who could convincingly portray an old man who has lost his mind through an acting performance that showcases the opposite of dementia? None other than Sir Anthony Hopkins! Here, we have this veteran actor at 82 years old who could very well be a victim of dementia himself at that ripe old age. Instead, he is firing at all cylinders, giving us this heartwarming performance of a lifetime making us convinced that he really has dementia, but the act of doing so just proves he is at the top of his game with elite-level acting.

8.0,Most realistic movie about dementia.,"The Father couldn't be more realistic when talking about Alzheimer's disease. I've seen my grandfather walking that path. He was a smart man but once the dementia kicked in he was barely recognizable, which was a hard thing to witness when you knew him as the intellectual he was. The Father just nailed this subject, bringing back so many memories, memories we would rather forget but that you can't. Living with a loved one with this disease isn't easy at all, certainly not when that person sometimes doesn't remember who you are. I didn't knew Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for his role, but after watching this movie I can only say it's highly deserved. It's probably one of his better performances ever, and that at 83 years old. The Father isn't a movie that will give you a lot of joy, it's sad and scary but certainly worth watching. Nobody wants to have a loved one suffering from dementia, it's a nightmare to live with. I remember my grandfather starting to smoke a cigarette like it was a thing he always did and that whilst he stopped more than forty years ago. I remember him telling me he was going crazy after asking me the same question for the twentieth time in barely an hour. He knew it was all going downhill, he knew he was a burden to everybody, and that must hurt when you are still that little bit lucid to understand that.

10.0,Probably the only movie I've seen that discusses aging and dementia in any meaningful capacity,"One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zeller's The Father is the closest I've seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind, but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue.The movie was unsettling from start to finish... in the best way possible. It's one that shows the unstable world around the aging Anthony, but with the underlying vigilance that what's ""wrong"" is not necessarily the world around him. And the horror of one's rationality clinging on to his very last bit of sanity is shown in the most surprisingly human way possible, and it's what makes The Father one of the finest movies of the year.Special credits to stars Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, who undoubtedly make the movie as every bit emotional and human. And Hopkins' performance in this movie is by far my favorite of the year. Overall, a very intense yet rewarding viewing experience that no one should miss out on.

9.0,Towering Performance,"Anthony Hopkins gives a towering performance and joined the ranks of multi-Oscar winning actors in this harrowing film.He plays an elderly man suffering from dementia, and the movie is filmed mostly from his point of view, meaning it's a disorienting experience for the viewer, as past runs into present runs into future, different actors play the same characters and then the same actors show up later playing different characters, the apartment in which he lives changes decor and layout. We're never sure whether we're getting an accurate version of events, and the last and devastating scene of the film leaves us wondering if anything that preceded it happened within the world of the movie at all or whether it was all a jumble of memories of events that occurred before the film even starts.The film is expertly written and directed in such a way to make it just frustrating enough for us to feel like we're in the shoes of the main character, but not too frustrating to make the movie overall a turn off. Given its accolades, I was surprised and maybe a touch disappointed that I wasn't more moved by it than I was, save for that last scene, which would have justified Hopkins' Academy Award even if nothing else leading up to it did, though everything leading up to it does as well.Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (who also directed) won an Oscar for adapting the screenplay from Zeller's play, and this is one stage-to-screen adaptation that doesn't scream its stage origins. I wasn't surprised it was based on a play, but on the other hand would have accepted that it was written directly for the screen too. Olivia Colman received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for playing Hopkins' daughter, or at least one iteration of her, while the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Best Production Design (and how wonderful to see work like this nominated in a category that usually favors obvious period or fantasy films), and Best Film Editing (again, a very high-brow choice by the Academy, and richly deserved).Grade: A.",towering performance,anthony hopkins gives towering performance joined ranks multi oscar winning actors this harrowing film he plays elderly man suffering dementia movie is filmed mostly his point view meaning its disorienting experience viewer as past runs into present runs into future different actors play same characters then same actors show up later playing different characters apartment which he lives changes decor layout were never sure whether were getting accurate version events last devastating scene film leaves us wondering if anything that preceded it happened within world movie at all or whether it was all jumble memories events that occurred before film even starts film is expertly written directed such way make it just frustrating enough us feel like were shoes main character but not too frustrating make movie overall turn off given its accolades i was surprised maybe touch disappointed that i wasnt more moved by it than i was save that last scene which would have justified hopkins academy award even if nothing else leading up it did though everything leading up it does as well christopher hampton florian zeller who also directed won oscar adapting screenplay zellers play this is one stage screen adaptation that doesnt scream its stage origins i wasnt surprised it was based play but other hand would have accepted that it was written directly screen too olivia colman received best supporting actress nomination playing hopkins daughter or at least one iteration her while film also copped nominations best picture best production design how wonderful see work like this nominated category that usually favors obvious period or fantasy films best film editing again very high brow choice by academy richly deserved grade,0.4779715099715101,0.124991452991453,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.51}"
9.0,Nearly Perfect,"""Why do you keep looking as if there's something wrong? Everything's fine.""The Father follows a man suffering from memory problems as he refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality. I honestly don't know where to begin. This is a mind-bender for the ages. Florian Zeller adapted his play into a screenplay along with Christopher Hampton. Naturally, Zeller also directed the film as well. Had he not collaborated on this project, I don't think it would ever be the same. He brought so much to this through his writing and directing. The way he made this confusing for both the viewers and Anthony (Anthony Hopkins' character) only enhances the experience. The first 30 minutes had me questioning everything I was watching. More questions are answered as the film continues but not in the most conventional way. We have to piece everything together. Any when I say everything I mean literally everything. Characters, timelines, location, just everything. It's not till the last moments where absolutely everything comes together in a way that makes sense. The screenplay is strong in the sense of storytelling, though a little bit of clarity would've been nice at a couple parts, but the dialogue is even stronger. The scenes that Anthony Hopkins are in-and it's basically every scene-he has hefty monologues. Every single scene is an award winning scene for both the actors, writing, and directing. Zeller directs the hell out of every scene. He gets the most out of the actors through expression and blocking. I find that those who have worked with stage production, whether it's writing or directing, have a way of knowing how to send a message through the screen. I know the awards shows don't favor stage-to-screen directing as much but I hope Zeller can pull through.Now if Anthony Hopkins doesn't win almost every award for his role, I'm going to be furious. If he doesn't win the Oscar it might go down as one of the biggest snubs in history. The only exception would be if Chadwick Boseman wins and it seems that they are going to campaign him in lead instead of supporting now. Hopkins goes through every emotion possible and takes the viewers with him. And like I said before, every scene he's in jail an award worthy scene. The very last scene had my pillow soaked in tears. The realistic acting and dialogue immersed you into the film and you forget this is acting. The same can be said for Olivia Colman. It's funny how she didn't become a household name until The Favourite. Now there's another chance she will get another Oscar. That is if she can beat Glen Close a second time. We, assuming you don't have severe memory problems, can associate with her character the most. She just wants what's best for her father but struggles to deal with his condition every day. Almost al of her scenes are heavy with emotional dialogue. Emotional doesn't always mean sad or angry, but the emotion put in to make the performance realistic is always evident. The rest of the cast does great as well. They don't have that much screen time, with the exception of Imogen Poots, but they use every minute they have. Speaking of Imogen Poots, I love to see how much she's grown as an actress. Every role keeps getting better and better. If she wasn't in the shadow of Colman, she very well could have a fair shot for awards nominations.It's hard to express words for The Father. It's been over a week since I watched it and I still can't stop thinking about it. Once it finished I considered watching it again. Even though I had three classes the next day, I should've watched it again. Time flies by so fast while watching. What felt like 30 minutes turned out to be an hour. But it's the use of time that's done so well. Both in the sense of runtime and the time in the film, the execution couldn't have been better.

9.0,How does one respond when they cannot know reality?,"How does one respond when they cannot know reality? This is the main question of the Father.The Father is adapted from director Florian Zeller's stage play by the same name. The story centers on Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), an aging man who slowly loses his grip on reality due to dementia. His daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) does her best to care for him, but she too has a life she wants to live-her boyfriend Paul (Rufus Sewell) has asked her to move to Paris with him. Anne struggles to find an aid who can handle her father, so that she can get on with her life. Zeller shared that his inspiration for the film was watching his grandmother, who raised him, pass away from dementia. You can feel the emotion coming through every part of the film.The movie starts with Anne confronting Anthony for chasing off the last assistant. Anthony claims he did it because she stole his watch. Anne patiently reminds him that he put it in his hiding place. She goes and finds the watch in his ""secret"" hiding place. At first, we are able to chuckle about the situation, but we soon become just as confused as Anthony. The tone of the movie shifts when Anthony stumbles upon a man in his flat who claims to be married to his daughter. He waits for Anne to return from the store to sort things out, but when she arrives, she is a different woman entirely.The rest of film has confusing moments like this. Once you think you have sorted things out, they are flipped again. I watched this at the premier at Sundance, and during the Q & A after the film, a woman asked if Anne went to Paris with Paul or not. Zeller responded that we don't know that answer, the answer is not what is important. Zeller stated that he wanted us to be as confused as Anthony and give up on trying to sort things out and just feel. And feel we do.Anthony Hopkins performance drove the emotion. His masterful control of minor expressions and vocal nuance intensified the whole film. I would not be surprised if he wins best actor next year. Zeller admitted that he named the character ""Anthony,"" because he wanted Anthony Hopkins to play the part. (The part was literally written for him.) Anthony's emotions swing in the film driven by his loss of memory and disorientation to events. Everyone seems to be on edge, not knowing how Anthony will respond. One moment he is happy, the next he is distressed. This comes out strongly when Anthony meets Laura (Imogen Poots) for the first time. Laura is a young woman who Anne has set up as Anthony's new caregiver. Anthony begins telling Laura how he used to be a tap-dancer. The scene is funny, and Laura laughs throughout. Suddenly, Anthony remarks that Laura reminds him of his other daughter, because of her inane laughter-and the mood has swung.The key question in the audiences mind is ""What is reality?"" Zeller disorients Anthony and the audience by having different actors play the same characters, then switching back. Zeller rearranges the same apartment, so we are unsure where we are-Anthony's apartment or Anne's. Anthony tells different versions of his career, and we even seem to experience events out of order. The only thing we are certain of is that they don't even speak English in Paris!This is not to say that there are multiple realities, but that Anthony cannot access what the true reality is. As the audience, we become like Anthony-confused. We do not know what his daughter looks like or if she is married. If she is, which man is her husband? However, this confusion over reality is meant to push us beyond discovering the truth and just feeling the helplessness of someone suffering from dementia. And to this point, it works.But, it takes us beyond this. By the end of the film we are all confused. We cannot access what reality is, and now it is time for us to ask, ""How do we respond?"" The film has its answer, but I'll leave it up to you to feel if you agree. This is one film that has to be watched to appreciate, because it focuses on the feeling of the experience and not the truth of the experience.A couple extra notes: First, Zeller shared that the classical music that Anthony listens to throughout the film is Hopkins's favorite music. Hopkins always wanted to be in a movie that used this music, and now he got the chance.Second, often movies adapted from stage plays can feel very confined and unnatural to the screen. Events that would naturally lead a character elsewhere seems to falsely confine them to that space, since the play needs to keep them there. However, Zeller does a nice job at expanding the world and making the small space feel new. Most of the film takes place in the apartment, but because of the rearrangement and use of different rooms in the apartment, it feels larger and natural.",how does one respond when they cannot know reality,how does one respond when they cannot know reality this is main question father father is adapted director florian zellers stage play by same name story centers anthony anthony hopkins aging man who slowly loses his grip reality due dementia his daughter anne olivia colman does her best care him but she too has life she wants live her boyfriend paul rufus sewell has asked her move paris with him anne struggles find aid who can handle her father so that she can get with her life zeller shared that his inspiration film was watching his grandmother who raised him pass away dementia you can feel emotion coming through every part film movie starts with anne confronting anthony chasing off last assistant anthony claims he did it because she stole his watch anne patiently reminds him that he put it his hiding place she goes finds watch his secret hiding place at first we are able chuckle about situation but we soon become just as confused as anthony tone movie shifts when anthony stumbles upon man his flat who claims be married his daughter he waits anne return store sort things out but when she arrives she is different woman entirely rest film has confusing moments like this once you think you have sorted things out they are flipped again i watched this at premier at sundance during q after film woman asked if anne went paris with paul or not zeller responded that we dont know that answer answer is not what is important zeller stated that he wanted us be as confused as anthony give up trying sort things out just feel feel we do anthony hopkins performance drove emotion his masterful control minor expressions vocal nuance intensified whole film i would not be surprised if he wins best actor next year zeller admitted that he named character anthony because he wanted anthony hopkins play part part was literally written him anthonys emotions swing film driven by his loss memory disorientation events everyone seems be edge not knowing how anthony will respond one moment he is happy next he is distressed this comes out strongly when anthony meets laura imogen poots first time laura is young woman who anne has set up as anthonys new caregiver anthony begins telling laura how he used be tap dancer scene is funny laura laughs throughout suddenly anthony remarks that laura reminds him his other daughter because her inane laughter mood has swung key question audiences mind is what is reality zeller disorients anthony audience by having different actors play same characters then switching back zeller rearranges same apartment so we are unsure where we are anthonys apartment or annes anthony tells different versions his career we even seem experience events out order only thing we are certain is that they dont even speak english paris this is not say that there are multiple realities but that anthony cannot access what true reality is as audience we become like anthony confused we do not know what his daughter looks like or if she is married if she is which man is her husband however this confusion over reality is meant push us beyond discovering truth just feeling helplessness someone suffering dementia this point it works but it takes us beyond this by end film we are all confused we cannot access what reality is now it is time us ask how do we respond film has its answer but ill leave it up you feel if you agree this is one film that has be watched appreciate because it focuses feeling experience not truth experience couple extra notes first zeller shared that classical music that anthony listens throughout film is hopkinss favorite music hopkins always wanted be movie that used this music now he got chance second often movies adapted stage plays can feel very confined unnatural screen events that would naturally lead character elsewhere seems falsely confine them that space since play needs keep them there however zeller does nice job at expanding world making small space feel new most film takes place apartment but because rearrangement use different rooms apartment it feels larger natural,0.4563669663669664,0.1015134865134865,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.45}"
