10.0,The third entry in the installment is one of the best Indiana Jones series.,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana ""beginning"" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat ""You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it."" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",third entry installment is one best indiana jones series,indiana jones last crusade 1989 is action classic adventure better film than temple doom is still best follow up trilogy clever it is also greatest sequel all time it is one my personal favorite adventure movies all time i love this movie death i loved it as child i still love it after dark middle chapter it was time indy return form more lighthearted fair indiana jones last crusade was answer not mention that bringing bond aka sean connery as indys dad was perfect casting connery adds his own whit charm along with indys usual counterparts who where missed temple doom last crusade also bookends trilogy well since artifact he is after is related god while indiana jones last crusade isnt by any means what i would consider stellar film it was still enjoyable memorable theatrical experience my opinion easily ranks as best sequel series all its faults shortcomings perhaps most all river phoenix laughably terrible haircut as young indy film succeeds hitting key notes at proper moments thus drumming up enough right combination story thematic elements action humor make it worthwhile nevertheless bottom line is that it still pales comparison level across board excellence that was achieved original 1981 movie still though fans this one will definitely want pick up this excellent release which throughout entire presentation i only came across handful things i thought could possibly be improved upon technically this is probably best installment indiana jones series raiders is spectacular introduction dr jones his style temple doom is awesome action adventure flick last crusade rights ship again with go broke production everything about it is huge jones is saving planet nazis second time budget was place off went spielberg make epic successfully film is bookended by two best things appear any spielbergs output young indiana beginning his archaeological career losing his treasure just like opening raiders being told by man his trademark hat you lost today kid but that doesnt mean you have like it at end riding off into sunset literally such conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here indiana jones last crusade has lots hand hand combat action filled chases gun fights main characters are near constant peril one is shot point blank almost bleeds death minor characters are killed somewhat gruesome ways including beheading bad guy meets his end fairly disturbing scene theres bit kissing banter its implied that two men have slept with same woman language is mild theres ultimately strong message about importance father son relationship indiana jones last crusade is 1989 american adventure film directed by steven spielberg story co written by executive producer george lucas it is third installment indiana jones franchise cult film still one my favorite films series last good indiana jones movie we didnt need another sequel after third release theres nothing more exciting than trying keep up with joneses indiana jones last crusade indys nazi enemies are back have kidnapped his father professor henry jones sr sean connery their effort locate sacred holy grail following trail america venice deserts middle east its up indy harrison ford save his father save grail save day this non stop action packed adventure whole family will treasure chemistry between sean connery harrison ford makes this movie stand out rest series story their father son relationship wrapped search holy grail is what makes this spectacular indy movie more meaningful adventure 10 10 bad ass seal approval,0.4447947035957241,0.2071246355685132,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Indiana Jones,So how do you return a franchise to it's successful past? Apparently bring back most of the cast from the first movie and the Nazis but add Sean Connery. This movie is as good if not even just a little bit better than the original. The interaction between Ford and Connery is amazing and makes for an enjoyable film. The action and story in this is great. This time (back to looking for Christian artifacts) Indy is out to find his father who went missing while looking for the Holy Grail.,indiana jones,so how do you return franchise its successful past apparently bring back most cast first movie nazis but add sean connery this movie is as good if not even just little bit better than original interaction between ford connery is amazing makes enjoyable film action story this is great this time back looking christian artifacts indy is out find his father who went missing while looking holy grail,0.41960784313725485,0.2639705882352941,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.15}"
10.0,The best of the Indiana Jones trilogy,"Indiana Jones, the man, the legend, the whip. Everyone I know has seen at least one of the Indiana Jones movies and usually Raiders of the Lost Ark is their favorite. Now I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark, I also really loved Temple of Doom even though it gets a lot of hate for it's darkness. But The Last Crusade is my favorite of the trilogy and the strongest in my opinion. For goodness's sake we have Sean Connery as Indiana's father, how could we get any better than that? I love his way of saying ""Junior!"", always gets me in a good chuckle. Harrison Ford still has that same Indy charm that swoons the ladies, the adventure that captivates the guys and takes us on an incredible journey that we'll never forget.In 1938, Indiana finally recovers the Cross and donates it to his friend Marcus Brody's museum. Indiana is later taken to the residence of wealthy businessman Walter Donovan, who informs him that his father has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, leaving behind partial directions from an incomplete stone tablet along with his diary containing his life's work on the Grail. Indiana and Marcus travel to Venice to investigate Henry's disappearance, meeting up with his colleague Elsa Schneider. Discovering catacombs beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indiana and Elsa find the tomb of Sir Richard, a knight of the First Crusade who is buried with a complete version of the tablet. Indiana finds his father, only to be betrayed by Elsa, who reveals that she and Donovan are working with the Nazis to find the Grail. The Nazis steal the Grail diary and capture Marcus in Iskenderun, where he was sent with pages from the diary to seek the protection of Sallah. The Joneses manage to escape the castle and follow the Nazis to Berlin, where they recover the diary from Elsa. The Joneses, Marcus and Sallah arrive to find that the Nazis are unable to pass through three ""trials"" of God. After Indy's father gets shot, he doesn't have much of a choice as to pass the trials and choose the correct cup to save his father's life.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a flawless movie that will always be timeless. My future kids will watch these movies, they're just a lot of fun. Who said archeology can't be fun? This also has one of the most exciting chase scenes of all time, Indiana is trying to rescue his father and a friend from a Nazi tank and he is on a horse, a brutal fight ensues and was just so exciting to watch. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and I still watch it with pleasure today, even with my friends we love watching Indiana and his adventures. They're an absolute blast and if you haven't seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, please take the first opportunity you have to watch it, it's a great movie.10/10",best indiana jones trilogy,indiana jones man legend whip everyone i know has seen at least one indiana jones movies usually raiders lost ark is their favorite now i loved raiders lost ark i also really loved temple doom even though it gets lot hate its darkness but last crusade is my favorite trilogy strongest my opinion goodnesss sake we have sean connery as indianas father how could we get any better than that i love his way saying junior always gets me good chuckle harrison ford still has that same indy charm that swoons ladies adventure that captivates guys takes us incredible journey that well never forget 1938 indiana finally recovers cross donates it his friend marcus brodys museum indiana is later taken residence wealthy businessman walter donovan who informs him that his father has vanished while searching holy grail leaving behind partial directions incomplete stone tablet along with his diary containing his lifes work grail indiana marcus travel venice investigate henrys disappearance meeting up with his colleague elsa schneider discovering catacombs beneath library where henry was last seen indiana elsa find tomb sir richard knight first crusade who is buried with complete version tablet indiana finds his father only be betrayed by elsa who reveals that she donovan are working with nazis find grail nazis steal grail diary capture marcus iskenderun where he was sent with pages diary seek protection sallah joneses manage escape castle follow nazis berlin where they recover diary elsa joneses marcus sallah arrive find that nazis are unable pass through three trials god after indys father gets shot he doesnt have much choice as pass trials choose correct cup save his fathers life indiana jones last crusade is one my favorite movies all time its just flawless movie that will always be timeless my future kids will watch these movies theyre just lot fun who said archeology cant be fun this also has one most exciting chase scenes all time indiana is trying rescue his father friend nazi tank he is horse brutal fight ensues was just so exciting watch ive watched this movie since i was little girl i still watch it with pleasure today even with my friends we love watching indiana his adventures theyre absolute blast if you havent seen indiana jones last crusade please take first opportunity you have watch it its great movie 10 10,0.5376984126984127,0.2044642857142857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.16}"
,The Last Crusade is the best of the Indy trilogy.,"Rating: **** out of ****My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course) (but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to.The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film, acting-wise, above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal (let me put it this way, he's only half a notch below Harrison Ford/Indy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything). The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises.The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene (all three movies really open with a bang, don't they?); which details how young Indy got his scar, whip, hat, and fear of snakes; makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom (and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones, for that matter).The story is engrossing because there's a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and, thus, there's a lot of engaging little discoveries (love the ""X marks the spot"" scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen this movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way, it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances.Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance (maybe even his best performance, period) in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven't seen before. It's his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment.",last crusade is best indy trilogy,rating out my opinion indiana jones last crusade could be deemed slightly biased it is first film i ever saw theaters its also first movie i purchased video i even own same worn down beat up copy look upon it even more fondly than widescreen edition sentimental reasons course but nothing beats pristine quality dvd i think its fair say its this movie that cemented my love cinema high regard i hold great escapism which is sorely lacking todays cinema movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or mtv style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs last crusade may only be thirteen years old but i think i can safely say they dont make them like they used film stars course harrison ford as indy jones archaeologist adventurer whos yet another quest this time find his father whod been searching holy grail said dad is played by none other than sean connery whose highly charismatic performance is quick place this film acting wise above others trilogy by giving ford genuine acting equal let me put it this way hes only half notch below harrison ford indy charisma appeal if that tells you anything rest film focuses this ongoing journey between father son eventually joined along by sallah marcus brody complete with amazing action stunt sequences clever humor nasty but fun surprises script by jeffrey boam takes few cues raiders lost ark but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention characterization delightful opening scene all three movies really open with bang dont they which details how young indy got his scar whip hat fear snakes makes better prequel than temple doom any adventure young indiana jones that matter story is engrossing because theres lot fun clues offered towards location grail thus theres lot engaging little discoveries love x marks spot scene im quite certain like with raiders lost ark plot has few holes but theyre fairly hard notice ive seen this movie quite few times but maybe its just my enjoyment film clouding that up either way it speaks volumes favor spielbergs direction performances given that action adventure is series selling point you can expect thrills wondrous delight discovery delivered spades action scenes are terrific matched well with john williams rousing memorable score also best trilogy best being fantastic ten minute chase sequence board tank possibly best action sequence spielbergs career i also loved motorcycle chase zeppelin setpiece where heroes go about dispatching two enemy fighters unexpected but quite hilarious fashion climax complete with frightening booby traps is suspenseful venture into unknown last crusade is far more humor oriented than its predecessors but part movies effectiveness is that its able deliver belly laughs without defusing tension during action sequences some jokes are just brilliant including one with indy armed with luger confrontation with trio nazis board tank thats even funnier than swordsman scene raiders well me at least supporting cast is all around superb john rhys davies is back as sallah wonderful as ever displaying bit more enthusiasm searching grail than he did digging up ark covenant late denholm elliot also returns as marcus brody most lovable goof museum curator alison doody is interesting as elsa blonde historian whom indy falls twist involving her character her actions towards climax make her not as one dimensional as she may initially appear julian glover is best main indy villains hes far more menacing than paul freemans belloq less over top but equally enjoyable as amrish pruris mola ram i also enjoyed michael byrnes performance as jones hating colonel vogel who relishes torturing indy his father when it comes pure delightfully nasty villainy byrne is even more fun watch than glover harrison ford delivers his best indy performance maybe even his best performance period this particular adventure with addition connery as his father it reveals personal side indy we havent seen before its his rapport with connery that separates this film rest genre they craft uncannily touching funny genuine bond that coupled with superb action thrills solidifies last crusade as pinnacle high adventure summer entertainment,0.4886634510125891,0.2282084701696771,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9.0,Raiders Of The Last Crusade.,"Indiana Jones teams up with his father to try and locate the Holy Grail. Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves.We didn't know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be.In 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic).I mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore.In comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture's trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure.Made for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that's a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2! And I gleefully count myself amongst that number. 9/10",raiders last crusade,indiana jones teams up with his father try locate holy grail something that nazis are again particularly interested themselves we didnt know it at time but every indiana jones fan planet presumed that last crusade was be final film feature intrepid archaeologist as it turned out another film would surface 2008 but casting that aside as many would like do last crusade should is judged as trilogy closer it was meant be 1988 steven spielberg was deep into bringing rain man fruition all thoughts indiana jones had gone by wayside with harshly judged part two temple doom stepped george lucas politely remind spielberg that they had agreement make another indiana jones picture spielberg no doubt obliged humble passed his rain man work barry levinson who promptly bagged himself oscar film it can be guessed that spielberg was probably grouchy around this period but he neednt have worried because last crusade provided much needed hit not only himself post empire sun but also lucas willow harrison ford frantic i mention run up this picture because it explains lot why film is pretty much retread raiders lost ark something that some detractors find unforgivable yet last crusade is still immensely enjoyable adventure picture with spielberg proving that he was still capable popcorn bonanza using raiders formula moving away dark flourishes temple doom last crusade is actually simplest film three but still it manages courtesy sparkling casting decision become most entertaining original trilogy is it better than raiders course not but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue agenda cliffhanging suspense like adventure films yore comes sean connery as dr jones senior its pictures trump card because magnificent interplay obvious rapport with ford cool as cucumber is there all see its this what drives film through more mundane picture filler sequences showcasing two top wily professionals with care consideration their craft casting alison doody as main female is poor one one only has look at her subsequent career post crusade see she wasnt up task here bonus comes form river phoenix prologue phoenix as young indiana paves way jaunty path that crusade takes whilst simultaneously giving us nice little back story which launch adventure made 48 million film went gross 474 171 806 worldwide now thats lot people who evidently were happy with raiders lost ark 2 i gleefully count myself amongst that number 9 10,0.45144467935165605,0.166622621564482,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10.0,Outstanding finale (or is it the finale?),"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was supposed to be the final movie in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. At least that's what director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas said at the time this film hit theaters. But now they've said there will be a fourth ""Indiana Jones"" film. I really don't know if that's a good idea, because the ""Last Crusade"" was a fitting end to a great movie series. Harrison Ford returns for his third go around as swashbuckling hero Indiana Jones, this time accompanied by Sean Connery as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. These two actors work beautifully together as they fight off the Nazis in search for the Holy Grail. Two actors from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" reprise their roles to great effect in ""Last Crusade"": Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Alison Doody is the heroine (good or bad?); Julian Glover is the villain; River Phoenix portrays a young Indy at the beginning to see how this character really got his start. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" not only has great characters, it also has a decent story (taking place in 1938), plus exciting action scenes and special effects. It's better than the second film ""Temple of Doom"" and comes very close to topping the first film ""Raiders"". The ""Indiana Jones"" series should stay right where it is with the ""Last Crusade"" as the finale. Unless Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford can prove us wrong and make a really good fourth film in the series, we shall see. I loved all three movies in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. If the fourth film does gets made, I hope it'll be equally as good as the first three.**** (out of four)",outstanding finale or is it finale,indiana jones last crusade was supposed be final movie indiana jones series at least thats what director steven spielberg producer george lucas said at time this film hit theaters but now theyve said there will be fourth indiana jones film i really dont know if thats good idea because last crusade was fitting end great movie series harrison ford returns his third go around as swashbuckling hero indiana jones this time accompanied by sean connery as indys father dr henry jones these two actors work beautifully together as they fight off nazis search holy grail two actors raiders lost ark reprise their roles great effect last crusade denholm elliott as marcus brody john rhys davies as sallah alison doody is heroine good or bad julian glover is villain river phoenix portrays young indy at beginning see how this character really got his start indiana jones last crusade not only has great characters it also has decent story taking place 1938 plus exciting action scenes special effects its better than second film temple doom comes very close topping first film raiders indiana jones series should stay right where it is with last crusade as finale unless spielberg lucas ford can prove us wrong make really good fourth film series we shall see i loved all three movies indiana jones series if fourth film does gets made i hope itll be equally as good as first three out four,0.44909147869674193,0.24104010025062653,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.24}"
,Probably The Best Movie Of The Trilogy.,"Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade was, in my opinion, the best movie of the Indiana Jones trilogy. This movie featured the same type of humor we have become accustomed to from Jones, as well as another beautiful woman (also probably the best Indy girl) and lots of great action scenes! This movie starts off with a teenage Indy (River Phoenix) which gives us a look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father, Henry (Sean Connery). We also learn he is a ""Junior"" and that he hates to be called that.Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story.Once again, the grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) does battle with the Nazis. Apparently, Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail, which contains the blood of Christ. So Indiana and his father team up to get there first. Along the way, there is a great action scene where Jones fights a few Nazis on board a moving tank.Overall, as I mentioned earlier, I believe this to be the best Indiana Jones movie of the three.

9.0,Movie Magic!,"When the two greatest filmmakers in the world teamed up to create the best action movie of all time - Raiders of the Lost Ark, it seemed unlikely that they could duplicate their divinely-inspired work. After a miss with the entertaining yet forgettable Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes pretty close to doing just that.Film history's most profitable star Harrison Ford returns to his signature role in a performance that speaks for itself, and benefits greatly from a gallery of memorable supporting characters. That includes Sean Connery, the grandest of all modern action day movie heroes (and appropriately cast, as the spiritual father of the character is James Bond). Connery plays against that, in a performance that is different than anything he has ever done, and it works. Even so, Denholm Elliott can't seem to help stealing every scene he's in as Marcus Brody, a lifelong friend of the Jones family.This movie stands by itself in the way it deals with spirituality, and is thick with religious themes throughout, without preaching to you. This is a very difficult balance to achieve in any film, and that alone makes the film stand out as brilliant. It is more abundant with humor than the previous two films, without the characters falling into irritating self-parody. Being a sequel, this is a difficult balance to achieve as well. (Look at action sequels such as Lethal Weapon 4).This film stands among the greatest action adventures of all time. I don't know anyone who hasn't seen it, but if you haven't, don't walk to see it.

10.0,X Marked This Spotand masterfully,"By the time of this writing, Blockbuster Inc. stores probably have all but vanished. Each with a sign that indicates that it's ""just this store"" that's closing. Sad, but that's how the story goes. Remember the Beta Video stores?When I was a kid, and we got our very first VCR – man, that was like the invention of television for those around my age – and I was able to save up enough money to buy two previously viewed movies. And get this: I had to actually pre-order previously viewed VCR tapes and they were incredibly $19.95 apiece!No matter; I really wanted both Lethal Weapon 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And bad.They were like gold for me. And they, along with a birthday gift of the original Batman, certainly earned their weight. I must've watched those three – my only movies – fifty times each.So, you can see: I am very familiar with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Every inch, score number and frame. I love this movie.Later, I would contest and readily agree, Raiders of the Lost Ark is both a masterpiece and better film, but that doesn't deter on howmuchFUN this third installment is. And I'm not even mentioning the dreadful part two: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In my mind, there's only Indy 1 and 3. You can even forget the (yawn) Young Indiana Jones (so-called) Adventures.Everything worked in this movie: suburb acting, hilarious and fun dialogue – mostly from the chemistry (or banter) of the two Jones's, extreme adventure, exciting action, fantastic characters, nostalgia – for fans of Raiders and great twists. And one of the best aspects is also a spoiler, – sorry, but if you haven't seen this 22-year-old epic, that's your fault – it has one of the best endings in the history of cinema: they actually ride off into the sunset. Brilliant and beautiful ending to the series!** - that is until they ruined it with the overkill: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Best advice? Think of this as the actual LAST adventure and forget that wretched sequel.Heck, I can't really pinpoint many, if any, faults or flaws in Last Crusade. Pooossssibly, the over-long opening segment with the original ""Young Indiana"" played by the late and great River Phoenix? Even that was entertaining, fun and had an awesome score track. So, technically, it's not a setback, but perhaps needed a little more editing.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is overwhelmed at school, but is more so when his father, Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery – in, Literally one of his best on-screen performances) is listed as missing. Indy is tempted with the prospect of finding the mystical Holy Grail, even though he, himself, doesn't believe it. He does set off on a mission to find his father, but we all know, he'd equally like to find this ""Lost Cup of Jesus Christ.""He meets up with (what I grew up referring to as ""the blonde"") the beautiful and seductive dame Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) and they quest to find daddy Jones and ward off Nazis. Not so much a spoiler, but he does rescue Henry Jones, Sr. and the race for the Grail is on between the Jones's and the Nazis.I left out a lot, but that's the basic, BASIC, premise. Seriously, if you have not seen this, or have even, see it (again, if you have) and learn to enjoy the film that frankly defines adventure. And a movie that captures the heart of the original, the atmosphere of the serials of before most of our times and how movies were really made: pre-CGI.On a related note: while some people are anti-3D, I am boarder-line anti-CGI. Sure it's a cheaper way of filmmaking, but I feel it's just that: cheap. Rarely will it be believable in my sight, for the most part it's all-but a cartoon and extremely laughable. That said, it can worksometimes. The recent 2010 Alice in Wonderland film is a perfect example of how it can really work and impress me. But, 80% of the time, it's just plain corny, distracting and again, CHEAP. My favorite action/adventures films are how they used to be made: with both inventiveness and heart. Like this one. Heck, I'll take a blue/green screen any day over a computer telling me what's ""real"" looking.But, I digress. I hesitate in calling this a masterpiece (in filmmaking, at least) but in my mind it is. And seeing that this is an opinion piece, I will go on record: it doesn't get much better than this.I remember some of the promotional shots on the late night shows from Harrison Ford, et al, that casually admitted Temple of Doom was a disaster – I AGREE – and this was a make-up movie. It sure the heck was! This was thee number one redemption movie of all time.Note to Hollywood: continue the redemption. Make movies like this, verses the CGI-laced, no-script films of the last decade or so. Remember what it's like to have this much fun in the movie going experience. I remember. I recall 1989 when this was released as my all-time favorite year in films released. Too bad, they haven't come close to '89 in 22 years.And Hollywood won't listen. I ask that you do. Support and watch movies like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Remember what it was like to have fun in the theatre, what it was like when real special-effect crews did real work on the fields and not in the office and remember what it was like to be a kid again.

7.0,Indiana Jones and the Welcome Return to Form,"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was the third and final instalment in the original Indiana Jones trilogy. Whereas ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was a prequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Last Crusade"" is a true sequel. Apart from an opening scene relating an adventure of the teenage Indy as a Boy Scout in 1912, the action takes place in 1938, two years after ""Raiders"". (In this opening scene we learn how the hero got his nickname; Indiana is not, as I had always assumed, his home state, but a name borrowed from his pet dog).Whereas ""Raiders"" was a great commercial and critical success, ""Temple of Doom"" received considerable criticism, both on account of its dark, gloomy atmosphere and its racist treatment of Indian characters. Steven Spielberg, therefore, was determined to make the third film lighter in tone, closer in spirit to ""Raiders"". Once again the villains are the Nazis, once again the plot involves the search for a legendary relic with mystical powers (in this case the Holy Grail which caused such excitement among King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table) and once again much of the action takes place in the Middle East. (This must be the only Hollywood film ever to be set- ostensibly- in the short-lived Republic of Hatay, formerly part of French Syria and today part of southern Turkey, which enjoyed a brief independence for several months in 1938/9. Most of the ""Hatay"" scenes, however, were shot in Spain, with the ruins of Petra, actually in Jordan, standing in for the temple in which the Grail is housed).The film also introduces us to Indy's father, Henry Jones, Sr. The James Bond films were undoubtedly one of the inspirations for this franchise, and it was possibly in their homage that Sean Connery was cast as the elder Jones, even though he is only twelve years older than Harrison Ford. (That speedboat chase along the Venetian canals also seems to be homage to Bond). Like his son, Henry senior is an academic archaeologist and has gone missing while seeking the Holy Grail. Indy believes that his father is in danger and sets out to find him, a quest that will take him to Venice, Germany and ultimately Hatay. The main female character is Henry's colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider, a glamorous Austrian blonde whose loyalties are ambiguous.There is more stress on character development here than in other episodes of the franchise, with emphasis being placed on the father-son relationship. The film is not just about the search for the physical Holy Grail. Even in the Arthurian legend the Grail was as much a symbol as a physical object, and today the phrase ""holy grail"" is used metaphorically for anything which is desirable and much sought-after. The film is also about Indiana's search for his lost father and their efforts to re-establish a relationship which in the past has often been strained- the story's metaphorical Holy Grail. Ford and Connery are both good at bringing out this aspect of the story. There are also good contributions from Denholm Elliott as Indiana's bumbling colleague Marcus Brody and Alison Doody as the treacherous, seductively sinister Elsa.After the awful ""Temple of Doom"", ""Last Crusade"" represents a welcome return to form, both for Spielberg and for Ford, who seemed ill at ease in the earlier film but here is back to his old ebullient self. The film contains a better balance of suspense and humour than did its predecessor, much of the humour being at the expense of the hapless Marcus. There are some excellent action scenes, such as the train sequence in the opening scene, the escape from the Zeppelin and the tank chase though the desert. ""Last Crusade"" is a very enjoyable adventure film in the same tradition as ""Raiders"". 7/10",indiana jones welcome return form,indiana jones last crusade was third final instalment original indiana jones trilogy whereas indiana jones temple doom was prequel raiders lost ark last crusade is true sequel apart opening scene relating adventure teenage indy as boy scout 1912 action takes place 1938 two years after raiders this opening scene we learn how hero got his nickname indiana is not as i had always assumed his home state but name borrowed his pet dog whereas raiders was great commercial critical success temple doom received considerable criticism both account its dark gloomy atmosphere its racist treatment indian characters steven spielberg therefore was determined make third film lighter tone closer spirit raiders once again villains are nazis once again plot involves search legendary relic with mystical powers this case holy grail which caused such excitement among king arthur knights round table once again much action takes place middle east this must be only hollywood film ever be set ostensibly short lived republic hatay formerly part french syria today part southern turkey which enjoyed brief independence several months 1938 9 most hatay scenes however were shot spain with ruins petra actually jordan standing temple which grail is housed film also introduces us indys father henry jones sr james bond films were undoubtedly one inspirations this franchise it was possibly their homage that sean connery was cast as elder jones even though he is only twelve years older than harrison ford that speedboat chase along venetian canals also seems be homage bond like his son henry senior is academic archaeologist has gone missing while seeking holy grail indy believes that his father is danger sets out find him quest that will take him venice germany ultimately hatay main female character is henrys colleague dr elsa schneider glamorous austrian blonde whose loyalties are ambiguous there is more stress character development here than other episodes franchise with emphasis being placed father son relationship film is not just about search physical holy grail even arthurian legend grail was as much symbol as physical object today phrase holy grail is used metaphorically anything which is desirable much sought after film is also about indianas search his lost father their efforts re establish relationship which past has often been strained storys metaphorical holy grail ford connery are both good at bringing out this aspect story there are also good contributions denholm elliott as indianas bumbling colleague marcus brody alison doody as treacherous seductively sinister elsa after awful temple doom last crusade represents welcome return form both spielberg ford who seemed ill at ease earlier film but here is back his old ebullient self film contains better balance suspense humour than did its predecessor much humour being at expense hapless marcus there are some excellent action scenes such as train sequence opening scene escape zeppelin tank chase though desert last crusade is very enjoyable adventure film same tradition as raiders 7 10,0.39563837129054524,0.10483091787439613,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.45}"
8.0,the best Indiana Jones movie ever?,"The third and the best of the adventures of Indiana Jones. In this new film, the famous archeologist is searching for a mythical object: ""the Graal"". This is the glass in which the Christ would have drank during the last meal with his apostles. His father assists him in his investigations because he's got precious information about the Graal. So, a long trip begins and will lead our two heroes from Venice to the Middle East in passing by Berlin. You can guess it, this trip has got its rough patches (otherwise the movie would appear devoid of interest). Indeed, the Nazis wish to discover the Graal too because it would make them powerful even dangerous.Steven Spielberg designed his movie like a fascinating treasure hunt and he had the good idea by bringing Sean Connery. Thanks to his presence, the movie's got a certain humor (perhaps a little too convenient but the result works) and allows to lighten the movie.""Indiana Jones and the last crusade"" is also a good surprise because it wipes out the unhappy memory of the previous movie: ""Indiana Jones and the temple of doom"". I found it too horrendous, bloody and even annoying due to Kate Capshaw. Here, to film Indiana Jones' incredible adventures, Spielberg adopted a dramatic and especially efficient film-making. He also avoids all that could make the movie fall in the faults quoted in the second movie. Moreover, there aren't any injury times, the rhythm is skilfully sustained (particularly during the pursuits) and it's better this way because the result is very convincing. Obviously, the movie doesn't go without a few unlikelinesses.Spielberg also brilliantly used the good old recipes for the adventure film: weird and exotic sceneries, the struggle between good and evil, the magic object that possesses supernatural powers etc...The only criticism I have to make of Spielberg is that the screenplay is perhaps well boosted but it doesn't also succeed in hiding a certain manicheism: the Nazis wish to get rid of Jones and his father and to discover the Graal would help them to satisfy their strength.An adventure movie entertaining enough to sustain the interest and rather well performed.

7.0,It should have remained the last,"Summer 1989. I was 8 years old. I only managed 2 movies that summer, one being Ghostbusters 2 (which blew my eager young mind at the time) and Last Crusade (which also blew my mind). I don't think I could have asked for two bigger blockbusters to choose from. Having been a rabid child fan of Raiders and Temple of Doom all things Indy were fresh in my mind and even as an 8-year-old I truly 'got' Last Crusade.Set 2 years after Raiders, and 3 years after Temple of Doom, Last Crusade opens with a flashback to Indy's youth and an aggravating cameo by River Phoenix in the role. His anachronistic hair, androgynous physiognomy, and that fact that he looks absolutely nothing like Harrison Ford take me out of the film every time, and spoils the long opening scene for me. The opening does nothing apart from establish all of Indy's trademarks (the hat, the whip, the scar, the fear of snakes), which he apparently all got within five minutes. Luckily the film soon jumps forward to 1938 and the opening quickly is forgotten about as shady antique collector Walter Donovan encourages Indy to go after the Holy Grail.With Der Fuhrer also after the sacred chalice Indy must once again face off against the despicable Nazis, rescue his bumbling father (Sean Connery, having the time of his life), and keep one step ahead of Donovan with Sallah and Brody tagging along.There is loads of inventive, exciting action in many exotic, breath-taking locations and all of it is immaculately photographed by Douglas Slocombe in lovely anamorphic Panavision. Even with today's many advancements in movie camera technology you'll rarely see a film as beautifully photographed as this. All very high-key, mind you, the polar opposite of the dark, subterranean Temple of Doom.Now, herein lies my only gripe with Last Crusade (other than River Phoenix) is the fact that it's just too light-hearted. Spielberg expressed regret over the fact that he made Temple of Doom very dark and mean-spirited (which I don't agree with as it is my personal favorite) so he compensated by making Last Crusade more cheerful and bright. It's not an annoying shift in tone, but it could have been balanced out with a bit more blood and gore.Last Crusade makes the perfect end to the real Indiana Jones trilogy. Spielberg really should have left it as our hero, his dad, and his two sidekicks rode off into the sunset. How can you top that? How can you come back from that? But 19 years later he tarnished many reputations and spoiled many memories with the deeply, DEEPLY misjudged Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.It was an amazing film to see as a child, and it's a shame that kids these days are not exposed to anything as good. If you can turn a blind eye to River Phoenix you will surely have a great time with Last Crusade. It's not the Snake Car on the train he ought to worry about, it's the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard.",it should have remained last,summer 1989 i was 8 years old i only managed 2 movies that summer one being ghostbusters 2 which blew my eager young mind at time last crusade which also blew my mind i dont think i could have asked two bigger blockbusters choose having been rabid child fan raiders temple doom all things indy were fresh my mind even as 8 year old i truly got last crusade set 2 years after raiders 3 years after temple doom last crusade opens with flashback indys youth aggravating cameo by river phoenix role his anachronistic hair androgynous physiognomy that fact that he looks absolutely nothing like harrison ford take me out film every time spoils long opening scene me opening does nothing apart establish all indys trademarks hat whip scar fear snakes which he apparently all got within five minutes luckily film soon jumps forward 1938 opening quickly is forgotten about as shady antique collector walter donovan encourages indy go after holy grail with der fuhrer also after sacred chalice indy must once again face off against despicable nazis rescue his bumbling father sean connery having time his life keep one step ahead donovan with sallah brody tagging along there is loads inventive exciting action many exotic breath taking locations all it is immaculately photographed by douglas slocombe lovely anamorphic panavision even with todays many advancements movie camera technology youll rarely see film as beautifully photographed as this all very high key mind you polar opposite dark subterranean temple doom now herein lies my only gripe with last crusade other than river phoenix is fact that its just too light hearted spielberg expressed regret over fact that he made temple doom very dark mean spirited which i dont agree with as it is my personal favorite so he compensated by making last crusade more cheerful bright its not annoying shift tone but it could have been balanced out with bit more blood gore last crusade makes perfect end real indiana jones trilogy spielberg really should have left it as our hero his dad his two sidekicks rode off into sunset how can you top that how can you come back that but 19 years later he tarnished many reputations spoiled many memories with deeply deeply misjudged kingdom crystal skull it was amazing film see as child its shame that kids these days are not exposed anything as good if you can turn blind eye river phoenix you will surely have great time with last crusade its not snake car train he ought worry about its viper room sunset boulevard,0.5214793906810036,0.2178844086021505,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8.0,Third part of Indiana Jones series with agreeable and sympathetic interpretation by Sean Connery,"The 1930s archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) , a larger that life hero , with its battered hat and whip wielding will confront evil Nazis for the obtaining the Holy Grail . This time he makes couple with his daddy (Sean Connery) along with a beautiful woman (Alison Doody) and friends (Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies) . Brave and daredevil Indiana Jones risks his life facing off villains , taking on armoured tanks , warplane , cliffs and several dangers and adventures.Dr.Indiana executes feats of derring-do in various exotic countries . It's the finale part of adventures trilogy (along with : Raiders of the lost ark and Temple of Doom ) going on the way of the 30s classic films and the Comic-books language .The picture blends comedy , adventures , action , rip-roaring , Cliff-hunger , tongue-in-cheek and being extremely entertaining and fun . Harrison Ford plays magnificently as the valiant and impulsive archaeologist turned into an action man .F or comic relief in charge of continued jokes about the relationship between Indy and his dad .The picture has great loads of action , special effects abundant and habitual and impressive John Williams musical score .The movie has a spectacular intervening period when Indiana is fighting against a tank that will have you on the edge of your seat , but the action never lets up. In this flick appears River Phoenix as an adolescent Indiana in a spectacular and frenetic beginning. The film is followed by the TV series ,also produced by George Lucas : ¨The young Indiana Jones¨ with Sean Patrick Flannery. The motion picture was splendidly directed by Steven Spielberg , being his favorite of the ""Indiana Jones"" films , and it is on record as saying he directed the pic for two reasons: To fulfill a three-picture obligation he had made with George Lucas, and, and to atone for the criticism that he received for the previous installment, Indiana Jones and the temple of Doom (1984). It obtained some Academy Awards, secondary Oscars for editing and sound effects, very well deserved although I miss didn't achieve more.

9.0,"A Marvelous Adventure, On Par with ""Raiders,"" That Adds Depth to the Jones Family Mythos","After two successful big-budget starring vehicles, we finally get an origin story for Indiana Jones. Of course, that's largely to facilitate the addition of a new supporting character (Sean Connery in a wonderful casting as Indy's long lost father, who we'll get to in just a moment) but that extra layer of nostalgia, wrapped around a property that's deeply nostalgic in the first place, manages to avoid numerous pitfalls and serve as an effective prologue. River Phoenix performs especially well as the young Jones, expertly wearing Harrison Ford's mannerisms throughout the long callback, and somewhere along the way we get a worthwhile genesis for the grown-up version's affinity for leather jackets and fedoras.Once the story jumps ahead to a more familiar era (if not precisely the present), it's full speed ahead on the hunt for the mythical holy grail, a lifelong obsession for the father and recent fixation of the third reich. Soon reunited, both Jones boys dance through precarious situations and near-misses in the history books, a full battalion of Nazi soldiers nipping at their heels, before drawing close to the prize. Ford and Connery are dynamic together, boiling down a complicated father-son relationship to a series of glares, grins and grunts. They alternate between bickering testily and slapping each other on the back in camaraderie, and I honestly can't say which makes for a more entertaining watch. There's depth, too, a stinging blend of long-simmering resentment and earnest care for one another, which often bubbles up just in time to enhance the plot's heaviest moments.Naturally, it simply wouldn't be an Indiana Jones movie without big action sets (in which the series somehow manages to one-up itself yet again) or boatloads of witty retorts and punchy one-liners, and those two essential elements combine to give the film a loose, fun-loving quality without compromising any of the more serious moments. All this without going too far over the top, as we saw more than once in the mildly underwhelming Temple of Doom and borderline-disastrous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's well-written and purposeful, successfully intense and humorous, an in-the-wheelhouse serial-styled adventure that spans several continents before confronting superstition and cracking several dusty, life-threatening riddles on the path to a biblical treasure. Indy probably should've left well-enough alone, because this chapter is essentially impossible to top.",marvelous adventure par with raiders that adds depth jones family mythos,after two successful big budget starring vehicles we finally get origin story indiana jones course thats largely facilitate addition new supporting character sean connery wonderful casting as indys long lost father who well get just moment but that extra layer nostalgia wrapped around property thats deeply nostalgic first place manages avoid numerous pitfalls serve as effective prologue river phoenix performs especially well as young jones expertly wearing harrison fords mannerisms throughout long callback somewhere along way we get worthwhile genesis grown up versions affinity leather jackets fedoras once story jumps ahead more familiar era if not precisely present its full speed ahead hunt mythical holy grail lifelong obsession father recent fixation third reich soon reunited both jones boys dance through precarious situations near misses history books full battalion nazi soldiers nipping at their heels before drawing close prize ford connery are dynamic together boiling down complicated father son relationship series glares grins grunts they alternate between bickering testily slapping each other back camaraderie i honestly cant say which makes more entertaining watch theres depth too stinging blend long simmering resentment earnest care one another which often bubbles up just time enhance plots heaviest moments naturally it simply wouldnt be indiana jones movie without big action sets which series somehow manages one up itself yet again or boatloads witty retorts punchy one liners those two essential elements combine give film loose fun loving quality without compromising any more serious moments all this without going too far over top as we saw more than once mildly underwhelming temple doom borderline disastrous kingdom crystal skull its well written purposeful successfully intense humorous wheelhouse serial styled adventure that spans several continents before confronting superstition cracking several dusty life threatening riddles path biblical treasure indy probably shouldve left well enough alone because this chapter is essentially impossible top,0.5022958371319028,0.147565640188591,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10.0,A truly great feel good film,"The second sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark is an awesome, beautifully crafted film, and arguably the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. The film is funnier, classier and far more laid back than the other two woody story lines, mostly because of the introduction of the excellent Sean Connery as Indy's eccentric father. Spielberg and Lucas get back on track after their off the rails first sequel in which to many peoples' horror had none of the Nazis or characters that made Raiders so unique, however, what Spielberg does to make this film a classic is the use of historical data with the swashbuckling storyline of adventure and action.

9.0,loads of fun,"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was made in 1989 and bristles with excitement, humor, suspense, special effects and, as a real plus, character development. In the beginning we get to see young Indy (River Phoenix) and where he got his fear of snakes, etc., and we meet his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), a brilliant professor.In this story, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) leaves his teaching job to again save the world from the Nazis. They have kidnapped Indy's father for his diary. The Nazis seek nothing less than the Holy Grail, for which Henry Jones has maps and notations in his diary which can lead to it. The Holy Grail here is a chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, received by Joseph of Arimathea and said to possess miraculous powers. Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while interring him. It's up to Indy to free his father.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes the audience on a thrilling journey to Venice, Austria, Germany and remote locations. The film never lets up its fast pace and around every corner, there's a special effect, or funny dialogue, or a brilliant escape.The great cast also includes Julian Glover, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, and Alison Doody.",loads fun,indiana jones last crusade was made 1989 bristles with excitement humor suspense special effects as real plus character development beginning we get see young indy river phoenix where he got his fear snakes etc we meet his father henry jones sean connery brilliant professor this story indiana jones harrison ford leaves his teaching job again save world nazis they have kidnapped indys father his diary nazis seek nothing less than holy grail which henry jones has maps notations his diary which can lead it holy grail here is chalice used by jesus at last supper received by joseph arimathea said possess miraculous powers joseph used grail catch christs blood while interring him its up indy free his father directed by steven spielberg indiana jones last crusade takes audience thrilling journey venice austria germany remote locations film never lets up its fast pace around every corner theres special effect or funny dialogue or brilliant escape great cast also includes julian glover john rhys davies denholm elliott alison doody,0.5093837535014005,0.2792717086834734,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,Not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark but an improvement on Temple of Doom,"Raiders of the Lost Ark was absolutely brilliant, while Temple of Doom was pretty good if disappointing. The Last Crusade improves on Temple of Doom while just lacking the brisk efficiency of Raiders. It looks fabulous and has a great music score. The script is deliciously witty especially with the interplay between Ford and Connery, and the story is engaging. The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox",not as good as raiders lost ark but improvement temple doom,raiders lost ark was absolutely brilliant while temple doom was pretty good if disappointing last crusade improves temple doom while just lacking brisk efficiency raiders it looks fabulous has great music score script is deliciously witty especially with interplay between ford connery story is engaging action is epic i liked neat sequence at beginning that explains things such as indys fear snakes how he got scar his chin steven spielburg does excellent job directing while both harrison ford sean connery masterstroke casting are perfectly cast as indy indys father whole exciting witty fun 9 10 bethany cox,0.696031746031746,0.38809523809523805,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.04, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,My Favorite of the Series,"Last Crusade is without a doubt my favorite of the Indiana Jones series, and I think a lot of people would agree. Sure there are some people who prefer Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this film is often regarded as one of the best sequels of all time. As it should be, it fixes most of the problems with it's predecessors, and enhances on the stuff that made that film work.There really isn't that much wrong with the movie, at it's worst moments it can be a little boring. But I also get confused as to what the movie is trying to do with with Dr. Shnieder. Spoiler Alert, but it turns out she's a Nazi, but then she's crying at the book burning, then she's clearly evil again, then she's good, then evil, by the end I wasn't sure if I was supposed to like her or not.The best part about this movie are the scenes between Indy and his dad. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are downright hilarious at times, and have great chemistry, I actually believed that they were father and son. The action scenes are fantastic, and unlike Raiders the pacing is perfect, a perfect blend of action, comedy, drama, and adventure. Most of the special effects have held up pretty well, sure some stuff is obvious green screen but most of it's not noticeable. The villains are good, not quite as good as the ones from Raiders, but very threatening. The adventure element is great, it's sort of a mystery as well as a treasure hunt. And River Phoenix looks exactly like a young Harrison Ford.Despite not being a hardcore Indiana Jones fan, I say Last Crusade is one of the best adventure movies ever made. It's funny, exiting, has some great characters, and is very well written and directed.",my favorite series,last crusade is without doubt my favorite indiana jones series i think lot people would agree sure there are some people who prefer raiders lost ark but this film is often regarded as one best sequels all time as it should be it fixes most problems with its predecessors enhances stuff that made that film work there really isnt that much wrong with movie at its worst moments it can be little boring but i also get confused as what movie is trying do with with dr shnieder spoiler alert but it turns out shes nazi but then shes crying at book burning then shes clearly evil again then shes good then evil by end i wasnt sure if i was supposed like her or not best part about this movie are scenes between indy his dad harrison ford sean connery are downright hilarious at times have great chemistry i actually believed that they were father son action scenes are fantastic unlike raiders pacing is perfect perfect blend action comedy drama adventure most special effects have held up pretty well sure some stuff is obvious green screen but most its not noticeable villains are good not quite as good as ones raiders but very threatening adventure element is great its sort mystery as well as treasure hunt river phoenix looks exactly like young harrison ford despite not being hardcore indiana jones fan i say last crusade is one best adventure movies ever made its funny exiting has some great characters is very well written directed,0.6129870129870132,0.21408279220779222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.34}"

2.0,"A ""Tom and Jerry"" version of an Indiana Jones film","When RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was released, my high school buddy and I were the first one in line. We had no idea what the film was about but we wanted to see something fun and spectacular. Well, we weren't disappointed. I remember this experience fondly.So when I saw INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE when it was released at the movies, I couldn't believe how terrible and pathetic it was from beginning (trite flashback to Indy's youth) to miserable end (sexist death of the sole female character in the whole film).Let's start with the beginning. Then again, maybe not. River Phoenix was totally miscast as the young Indiana Jones. He just doesn't look like he's having fun at all. And to have Indy go through a number of incidents that took place at one time that explains Indy's fear of snakes, his hat, his whip, etc, was so bleeding obvious and badly conceived that I thought it was a parody. But it's not. It's played straight. After seeing that beginning, I knew I was going to suffer much more. And suffer, I did.Practically every aspect of what made the first film so fun and memorable was ruined by the terrible screenplay by Jeffrey Boam. The film is just a collection of crude in-jokes, a boat-load of silly coincidences, badly conceived action scenes (most of them echoing and relying on those from the first film), a story filled with so many mistakes and gargantuan plot-holes, sprinkled with forced comedy bits and all wrapped up in a neat package that made Paramount happy. The fact is, this was a stinker, and they knew it. The series, only after three movies, had already ran out of steam and it ended after this one. Everything felt forced in LAST CRUSADE. Harrison Ford looked bored. Like Phoenix, Sean Connery was miscast as Indy's father. The only reason they hired Connery was to make a link with the Indy series and the James Bond series. Nothing else. Connery added nothing to the series. But the worst aspect of this turkey was its only female character. In the first Indiana Jones, Marion was an equal to Indy. She was spunky, tough and cute. In LAST CRUSADE, Alison Doody plays Elsa, an unpleasant blond NAZI bitch who dies a miserable death at the end. Pretty sad when you think about it.The action throughout the movie was as compelling as a Tom & Jerry cartoon. Case in point, when Connery scares the birds on the beach and makes them fly directly in front of a plane, in order to bring the plane down. Not only is this scene stupid but it's really crass re: the birds' welfare. The coincidences were so moronic and such groaners (Indy bumping into Hitler) that I've never done so much eye rolling during the viewing of of a single film. Had this been the first Indiana Jones film, it would have flopped because it relies so much on RAIDERS' coat tails that if you haven't seen the first one, it wouldn't make much sense. After the bad experience that was TEMPLE OF DOOM, INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE was the last straw and my enthusiasm for this ""series"" completely evaporated. That was 18 years ago. Now I hear they're doing an Indy 4. They shouldn't bother with it. Put a fork in it. It's done.",tom jerry version indiana jones film,when raiders lost ark was released my high school buddy i were first one line we had no idea what film was about but we wanted see something fun spectacular well we werent disappointed i remember this experience fondly so when i saw indiana jones last crusade when it was released at movies i couldnt believe how terrible pathetic it was beginning trite flashback indys youth miserable end sexist death sole female character whole film lets start with beginning then again maybe not river phoenix was totally miscast as young indiana jones he just doesnt look like hes having fun at all have indy go through number incidents that took place at one time that explains indys fear snakes his hat his whip etc was so bleeding obvious badly conceived that i thought it was parody but its not its played straight after seeing that beginning i knew i was going suffer much more suffer i did practically every aspect what made first film so fun memorable was ruined by terrible screenplay by jeffrey boam film is just collection crude jokes boat load silly coincidences badly conceived action scenes most them echoing relying those first film story filled with so many mistakes gargantuan plot holes sprinkled with forced comedy bits all wrapped up neat package that made paramount happy fact is this was stinker they knew it series only after three movies had already ran out steam it ended after this one everything felt forced last crusade harrison ford looked bored like phoenix sean connery was miscast as indys father only reason they hired connery was make link with indy series james bond series nothing else connery added nothing series but worst aspect this turkey was its only female character first indiana jones marion was equal indy she was spunky tough cute last crusade alison doody plays elsa unpleasant blond nazi bitch who dies miserable death at end pretty sad when you think about it action throughout movie was as compelling as tom jerry cartoon case point when connery scares birds beach makes them fly directly front plane order bring plane down not only is this scene stupid but its really crass re birds welfare coincidences were so moronic such groaners indy bumping into hitler that ive never done so much eye rolling during viewing single film had this been first indiana jones film it would have flopped because it relies so much raiders coat tails that if you havent seen first one it wouldnt make much sense after bad experience that was temple doom indiana jones last crusade was last straw my enthusiasm this series completely evaporated that was 18 years ago now i hear theyre doing indy 4 they shouldnt bother with it put fork it its done,0.5572982338475299,-0.06135032416722557,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.33}"
