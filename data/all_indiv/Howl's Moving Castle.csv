10,A wild and surreal trip into the mind of a master.,"I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.What I love about this movie is that it's highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one's own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.I think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it's one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.Also, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki's more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.If you're looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you're not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream.",wild surreal trip into mind master,i think this is possibly miyazakis most intriguing movie all his other films are very linear even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning highly creative i feel dreamy world howls moving castle is by far most captivating bizarre imaginative all worlds miyazaki has ever envisioned what i love about this movie is that its highly emotional without great deal logic or plot or story get way this way film is simple pure extremely beautiful it is as if characters go one emotion next world that is as random as ones own dreams some people have complained about lack plot or story or serious character development but even though characters are fairly static their emotions physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out higher truth that is seldom given such artistic natural freedom i think this is very smart movie many subtle ways its one that i look forward watching again big screen then dvd although it flirts theme theme theme with kind animated attention deficit disorder landscapes utter unabated surrealism left me stunned never bored also quizzical character design perspective howl is certainly one if not most beautiful characters that miyazaki has ever created howl is interesting departure miyazakis more classical wabi sabi anime style that most his heroes heroines are drawn as howl is definitely very contemporary bishonen if youre looking quaint settings dynamic characters very involving character or plot driven story youre not going necessarily find them here but you will find equally stunning pleasing movie if you let yourself go enjoy this passionate heartfelt surreal miyazaki dream,0.6146811224489795,0.22545493197278904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10,This is art,"Howl's Moving Castle is as marvelous and magical as Miyazaki's other great work. Something in Disney's advertising or the description I read gave the false impression that it was going to be sub-standard work meaning it was still going to be better than anything DreamWorks Animation was doing (Madagascar was sooo pedestrian).While not as awe-inspiring as Spirited Away or action-packed as Mononoke, it does work on the level of Kiki's Delivery Service as a girl is forced to be better than she thinks she can be (well, that's not a big surprise, that's all his films). And as with all Miyazaki stories, the story teaches without being preachy. And the lessons learned are represented in character changes and in the character's physical appearance as well. It's that same attention to detail that has made Pixar so great.The animation is wonderful. The castle is itself is a mesh-mash of so many haphazardly arranged pieces that an engineer would have an aneurysm just sorting them all out and yet it works. Through magic, of course. The magic being Howl's and the authoritative hand of Miyazaki's direction. The airships (wow, airships in a Miyazaki film? Who would have thunk?) are great variations of one's he's used before and there are some rather dark and beautiful scenes of a world at war.Most of the voice work was very strong including Christian Bale (Howl) and Emily Mortimer (as the young version of the heroine, Sophie). The voice that surprised me was Billy Crystal as Calcifer, the little flame that could. He's the heart of the castle and only annoyed at his first few scenes then becomes a very likable character.There a few clunky moments in the plot line where transitions between story points weren't very strong, but overall it's another outstanding film from Studio Ghibli. Even my 40 year old partner, who had spent the day mountain biking, was dead tired and had never seen a Miyazaki film stayed awake for the entire 2 hours. When we left at 3:30 in the morning still jabbering away about all the imagery and meaning, we realized we had seen true art.",this is art,howls moving castle is as marvelous magical as miyazakis other great work something disneys advertising or description i read gave false impression that it was going be sub standard work meaning it was still going be better than anything dreamworks animation was doing madagascar was sooo pedestrian while not as awe inspiring as spirited away or action packed as mononoke it does work level kikis delivery service as girl is forced be better than she thinks she can be well thats not big surprise thats all his films as with all miyazaki stories story teaches without being preachy lessons learned are represented character changes characters physical appearance as well its that same attention detail that has made pixar so great animation is wonderful castle is itself is mesh mash so many haphazardly arranged pieces that engineer would have aneurysm just sorting them all out yet it works through magic course magic being howls authoritative hand miyazakis direction airships wow airships miyazaki film who would have thunk are great variations ones hes used before there are some rather dark beautiful scenes world at war most voice work was very strong including christian bale howl emily mortimer as young version heroine sophie voice that surprised me was billy crystal as calcifer little flame that could hes heart castle only annoyed at his first few scenes then becomes very likable character there few clunky moments plot line where transitions between story points werent very strong but overall its another outstanding film studio ghibli even my 40 year old partner who had spent day mountain biking was dead tired had never seen miyazaki film stayed awake entire 2 hours when we left at 3 30 morning still jabbering away about all imagery meaning we realized we had seen true art,0.5618950437317783,0.20335034013605435,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10,Try to decode the story ...,"Probably many people find the story confusing. I felt the same way when I saw it in the theater for the first time! The story seemed arbitrary and I couldn't connect the pieces together (much like I saw ""Ashes of Time"" for the first time). But when I watch it again on the DVD, I realize the movie is probably about one thing: personal freedom.Howl is a free person. He doesn't has a heart and even his home (which is usually characterized as a stable point in one's life) can move :-) He is disguised as different wizards in different counties, and when Sophie asks him how many identities he has, he said ""Enough to guarantee my freedom"". When Sophie confronts Suliman, she comments Howl as ""selfish and cowardly and unpredictable, but he's straight as an arrow. He only wants to be free."" But in Miyazaki's world, nothing is black and white. According to Suliman, Howl's power is too great for a person without heart, and he will eventually becomes a monster (some political figures come to my mind).Sophie, on the other hand, is bounded by responsibilities. She is young, but her heart is old. She refuses the invitation from her friends and keep working at the hat shop. When her sister asks her ""Are you going to spend your life in that shop?"" She replies ""It meant so much to papa. Besides, I'm the eldest."". Even her sister asks her to ""look out for yourself"". When Sophie is turned to an old lady, it actually set her free because the good thing of being old is that one has ""so little to lose"" She becomes more adventurous and takes control of her life. She is very assertive as being the cleaning lady in Howl's castle and even tames Calcifer to cook her food. For Howl, his turning point comes when he refuses to move his castle anymore (I'll leave it to the reader as why he does that) By the end of movie, he regains his heart. He feels terrible because it is like ""trapped under a stone"". And Sophie says, ""Yes, a heart is a heavy burden"".There are other wonderful things in the movie. For example, this is probably one of the few movies that tell me what it is really like to be old. But I do want to highlight the thread about personal freedom as it will help you to tie up the pieces of the story.Since there are 1000 words limit in the comment system, I'll write more in by blog: http://web.mac.com/kenlaw/iWeb/Site/Blog/Blog.html",try decode story,probably many people find story confusing i felt same way when i saw it theater first time story seemed arbitrary i couldnt connect pieces together much like i saw ashes time first time but when i watch it again dvd i realize movie is probably about one thing personal freedom howl is free person he doesnt has heart even his home which is usually characterized as stable point ones life can move he is disguised as different wizards different counties when sophie asks him how many identities he has he said enough guarantee my freedom when sophie confronts suliman she comments howl as selfish cowardly unpredictable but hes straight as arrow he only wants be free but miyazakis world nothing is black white according suliman howls power is too great person without heart he will eventually becomes monster some political figures come my mind sophie other hand is bounded by responsibilities she is young but her heart is old she refuses invitation her friends keep working at hat shop when her sister asks her are you going spend your life that shop she replies it meant so much papa besides im eldest even her sister asks her look out yourself when sophie is turned old lady it actually set her free because good thing being old is that one has so little lose she becomes more adventurous takes control her life she is very assertive as being cleaning lady howls castle even tames calcifer cook her food howl his turning point comes when he refuses move his castle anymore ill leave it reader as why he does that by end movie he regains his heart he feels terrible because it is like trapped under stone sophie says yes heart is heavy burden there are other wonderful things movie example this is probably one few movies that tell me what it is really like be old but i do want highlight thread about personal freedom as it will help you tie up pieces story since there are 1000 words limit comment system ill write more by blog,0.47091836734693876,0.07916666666666669,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7,interesting world,"Sophie is a young shy hat maker working for her mother in an alternate-world turn-of-the-century European town. A wizard named Howl rescues her from a couple of lascivious soldiers only to be chased by a horde of waste demons. They escape to her sister Lettie's place. She is later visited by the Witch of the Waste and turned into an old woman. She runs away and encounters scarecrow Turnip-Head. After helping it, it leads her to Howl's Moving Castle. There she encounters the fire demon Calcifer who Howl uses to power the castle. Calcifer offers to break her curse if she could end his servitude. Sophie pretends to be new cleaning lady Grandma Sophie. The Mayor arrives at the Great Wizard Jenkins with a request from the King to fight in the war. Howl's apprentice Markl is able to switch between various exits and with various disguises. Then the other king invites Great Wizard Pendragon to join in the war. Howl is known as both wizards and unwilling to help either side. Madame Suliman threatens to take away his powers before he is lost after losing his heart.This is an interesting world. The start sets up an easy fantasy with an evil witch and a haunted hero. The twist is the heroine gets turned into an old hag. About midway, the movie takes an odd turn that deviates from that easy formula. The evil witch becomes powerless. There is a new villain but she's not really a villain. This is an anti-war movie but it isn't so straight forward. Even the simple love story gets a last-minute true love detour. While the world is amazing, the story seems to delight in odd diversions from the formula.",interesting world,sophie is young shy hat maker working her mother alternate world turn century european town wizard named howl rescues her couple lascivious soldiers only be chased by horde waste demons they escape her sister letties place she is later visited by witch waste turned into old woman she runs away encounters scarecrow turnip head after helping it it leads her howls moving castle there she encounters fire demon calcifer who howl uses power castle calcifer offers break her curse if she could end his servitude sophie pretends be new cleaning lady grandma sophie mayor arrives at great wizard jenkins with request king fight war howls apprentice markl is able switch between various exits with various disguises then other king invites great wizard pendragon join war howl is known as both wizards unwilling help either side madame suliman threatens take away his powers before he is lost after losing his heart this is interesting world start sets up easy fantasy with evil witch haunted hero twist is heroine gets turned into old hag about midway movie takes odd turn that deviates that easy formula evil witch becomes powerless there is new villain but shes not really villain this is anti war movie but it isnt so straight forward even simple love story gets last minute true love detour while world is amazing story seems delight odd diversions formula,0.4597101972101972,0.07864057239057241,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10,For those who love the book  or wondered about it,"When I read some four years ago that Diana Wynne Jones had sold the rights for Howl's Moving Castle to a Japanese animator, I wondered. The book (one of my very favorites, which I re-read at least once a year) takes several fairy-tale conventions and merrily turns them upside down. Ms Jones refuses to allow her imagination be neatly pigeonholed as hard sci-fi or straight fantasy, juvenile or adult. This story (as all of her stories) revels in word play. I really wondered how it would all come out translated into Japanese.I'd never heard of Miyazaki. Then I saw Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, The Cat Returns, and Kiki's Delivery Service. Wow. I think Ms Jones and Mr. Miyazaki must be kindred souls. His movies share a lot with her novels  a whimsical sense of humor, impossible to pigeonhole into a category, magic and mischief, and a firm respect for the audience's intelligence. I began to pace the floor in anticipation of the movie.I saw the movie today. I was not disappointed. The soul of the story is intact, Sophie and Howl and Calcifer are nearly as I imagined them. Yes, there are some plot adjustments. Think of it as the Series 12C version (for those who have read Ms Jones' Chrestomanci books.) The main elements are there, some re-arranged, some changed, yet with a full understanding of the original. Much like the 2004 version of Peter Pan  much was changed, but the soul is the same.For those who wonder, here are the differences between the movie and the novel. I've tried to phrase them carefully to avoid spoilers for either fans of Ms Jones's work who have yet to see the movie, and those who have seen the movie and have yet to read the book: Why the witch bespells Sophie Where the door opens when the dial points to blackSophie's sister Martha, and the plot line involving sister Lettie are not in the movie  Mrs. Pentstemmon, Miss Angorian, Mrs. Fairfax are also missing, but elements of each are woven into other characters in the movie  Michael (Markl) is a different age  The battles  magical and military  are quite different (but equally spectacular)  The dog appears at a different time, with a different, yet just as mysterious, agenda  The scarecrow's relationship with Sophie is different  Thelevel of technology is different. (I did miss the 7-league boots)My advice: go see the movie. It's magical and beautiful and funny. Then, if you are a Diana Wynne Jones fan, check out the rest of Miyazaki's films. Now is a great time, as many of his films are available on home DVD. If you are a Miyazaki fan, hie thee to a library or bookstore try Ms Jones' books.

9,Howl's Moving Castle is an imaginative and delightful Miyazaki film,"I love anime, and when I noticed that Howl's Moving Castle was showing today, I knew I had to see it. And you know what, I wasn't disappointed. I admit I haven't read the book by Diana Wynne Jones, but this film is so imaginative and delightful I doubt I would have cared if it was unfaithful to the book or not. The animation here is amazing, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colours so bright. Plus the castle itself was a wonder to behold. The visual style here also has a certain elegance about it, and the atmosphere the visuals create is somewhat meticulous. I also have to mention the score, it was absolutely stunning. Beautiful, magical and poignant themes that caressed my ears, like a Mozart opera would. The characters are engaging and are beautifully voiced by a terrific voice cast. Christian Bale's(not a stranger to voice work, he voiced Thomas in Disney's Pocahontas as well) seductive and silky voice brings vain wizard Howl to vivid life, and Sophie is a very lovable and beautiful character, whether in her younger form or her older form. Her younger form is sensitively voiced by Emily Mortimer and her older self is voiced by the late Jean Simmons with real sincerity. The Witch of the Waste is a character consumed by jealousy, so much so it results in Sophie's transformation from a young 18 year old girl to a pensioner. This character is perfectly voiced by screen legend Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is a joy to behold as Calcifer, one of my favourite characters in the film, and Turniphead was very intriguing as well. The story is a sweet, timeless imaginative one, not the best written one by all means, but it did touch me a lot. Did I notice anything wrong? Yes, but these flaws are minor compared to the overall beauty of the film. The final third is a little too rushed, and the ending is a little over-surreal. But overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enchanting and delightful work from Miyazaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox",howls moving castle is imaginative delightful miyazaki film,i love anime when i noticed that howls moving castle was showing today i knew i had see it you know what i wasnt disappointed i admit i havent read book by diana wynne jones but this film is so imaginative delightful i doubt i would have cared if it was unfaithful book or not animation here is amazing backgrounds are gorgeous colours so bright plus castle itself was wonder behold visual style here also has certain elegance about it atmosphere visuals create is somewhat meticulous i also have mention score it was absolutely stunning beautiful magical poignant themes that caressed my ears like mozart opera would characters are engaging are beautifully voiced by terrific voice cast christian bales not stranger voice work he voiced thomas disneys pocahontas as well seductive silky voice brings vain wizard howl vivid life sophie is very lovable beautiful character whether her younger form or her older form her younger form is sensitively voiced by emily mortimer her older self is voiced by late jean simmons with real sincerity witch waste is character consumed by jealousy so much so it results sophies transformation young 18 year old girl pensioner this character is perfectly voiced by screen legend lauren bacall billy crystal is joy behold as calcifer one my favourite characters film turniphead was very intriguing as well story is sweet timeless imaginative one not best written one by all means but it did touch me lot did i notice anything wrong yes but these flaws are minor compared overall beauty film final third is little too rushed ending is little over surreal but overall howls moving castle is enchanting delightful work miyazaki 9 10 bethany cox,0.5831619047619045,0.2557523809523809,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10,My favourite Miyazaki!,"What an amazing achievement! This is by far the best example I have ever seen of animated characterization. The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. I love all of Miyazaki's work, but in Howl's Moving Castle he has managed to take it to a level that to me sets the standard.It has all of the classic stunning Miyazaki panoramas, rich settings, exciting and unusual machinery, and brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous and fanciful. The characters are all very expertly crafted and developed, but what really enchanted me were their expressions and the subtle but powerful ways that he chose to elaborate on their connections and emotions. It is very difficult to describe, but they come to life in such a powerful way as to seem entirely real and unique.He achieves this within the medium - not by really imitating or parroting film or live action, but by artfully exploiting the medium to enhance and capture the subtle interactions that make up relationships. He shows his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling by carefully chosen gestures and facial expressions, rather than relying always on dialog, etc. I was completely swept away by this skillful use of animation - I have never anywhere else seen anything that begins to come close to it.The story is fantastic - I haven't read the novel, but it had all of the elements I have come to enjoy in Miyazaki's work - there is the humour, the lighthearted moments, the strong, insightful, loyal, and honourable characters, the lyrical drama and action sequences. The pace is perfect - it flows nicely and is always exciting, suspenseful - I got very caught up in the characters and their struggles and hopes. The themes were expertly handled with Miyazaki flair - and always richly meaningful and perceptive.I can hardly wait to see what this brilliant artist creates next!",my favourite miyazaki,what amazing achievement this is by far best example i have ever seen animated characterization expressions nuances emotion captured this film are truly breathtaking i love all miyazakis work but howls moving castle he has managed take it level that me sets standard it has all classic stunning miyazaki panoramas rich settings exciting unusual machinery brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous fanciful characters are all very expertly crafted developed but what really enchanted me were their expressions subtle but powerful ways that he chose elaborate their connections emotions it is very difficult describe but they come life such powerful way as seem entirely real unique he achieves this within medium not by really imitating or parroting film or live action but by artfully exploiting medium enhance capture subtle interactions that make up relationships he shows his audience what his characters are thinking feeling by carefully chosen gestures facial expressions rather than relying always dialog etc i was completely swept away by this skillful use animation i have never anywhere else seen anything that begins come close it story is fantastic i havent read novel but it had all elements i have come enjoy miyazakis work there is humour lighthearted moments strong insightful loyal honourable characters lyrical drama action sequences pace is perfect it flows nicely is always exciting suspenseful i got very caught up characters their struggles hopes themes were expertly handled with miyazaki flair always richly meaningful perceptive i can hardly wait see what this brilliant artist creates next,0.6414772727272727,0.2795196280991736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.34}"
6,"Ghibli's messiest, most nonsensical movie is pretty good","This is a very good movie, but I have a lot of issues with it.This movie, espcially its messy third act, feels like sensory overload. Everything is happening so fast and so loud and the quiet moments of rest (which are always the best parts of every Ghibli film) are very few and far between compared to other Ghibli films. It feels very rushed and overwhelming and it gives me a headache.Also, the exact nature of Sophie's curse (and the movie's world in general) is never really explained. I like how her age changes, but it would be good to know what exactly triggers those changes. A lot in this film is unexplained and it's very frustrating. This is probably Ghibli's most nonsensical movie.With that said, I do like it. While I think that the second half is kind of a mess, the first half is really good. It's a lot slower and more focused. There are less characters and there's actual moments to rest and contemplate the beautiful scenery. The ending is also really nice.The best things about this movie are the visuals (obviously) and Howl, especially when he's being a total drama queen. I want more dramatic Howl please.Overall, this is far from being one of my favorite Ghibli movies, but I think the good outweighs the bad just enough. I know it's really beloved, but I will still take Spirited Away or Whisper of the Heart over this anytime.",ghiblis messiest most nonsensical movie is pretty good,this is very good movie but i have lot issues with it this movie espcially its messy third act feels like sensory overload everything is happening so fast so loud quiet moments rest which are always best parts every ghibli film are very few far between compared other ghibli films it feels very rushed overwhelming it gives me headache also exact nature sophies curse movies world general is never really explained i like how her age changes but it would be good know what exactly triggers those changes lot this film is unexplained its very frustrating this is probably ghiblis most nonsensical movie with that said i do like it while i think that second half is kind mess first half is really good its lot slower more focused there are less characters theres actual moments rest contemplate beautiful scenery ending is also really nice best things about this movie are visuals obviously howl especially when hes being total drama queen i want more dramatic howl please overall this is far being one my favorite ghibli movies but i think good outweighs bad just enough i know its really beloved but i will still take spirited away or whisper heart over this anytime,0.5274149659863946,0.21727891156462578,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.23}"

And while I enjoyed the film immensely due to its excellent animation, story and overall sense of fun, it was also interesting to see how much my daughter hated it! It was as if we saw two entirely different films. Why? Well, she is a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan and has read and re-read just about everything she ever wrote. And, according to her, the story was so different and so inferior to the book that she disliked the film and said some very nasty things about director Miyazaki. However, my advice is DON'T read the book and just go and see the movie.

10,Hayao Miyazaki casts his spell on us,"The genius of Anime films, Hayao Miyazaki, shows why he is one of an absolute masters of the genre. Taking Diana Wynne Jones' story ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and creating the magnificent film for our delight, is something that no other man could have accomplished with as much flair and panache as Mr. Miyazaki has done.The film has such a great look that at times we wonder if one is really seeing an animated film, or not. The images we watch on the screen have such detailed and rich look that we wonder how did Mr. Miyasaki could have accomplished it.Not having seen the Japanese version, the English one that was released here offers great voices to go along with the many characters in the film. The big surprise was Jean Simmons, an actress we haven't see much lately who does a great job with the older Sophie. As the young Sophie, Emily Mortimes is wonderful and her voice suits the character so well. It was also a stroke of genius to have cast Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, as she seems to be having a great time acting her. Billy Crystal was delightful as Calcifer and Josh Hutcherson is perfect as Markl. Christian Bale is an amazing Howl.

7,"Terrific Miyazaki, although not his best","""Howl's Moving Castle"" opened here in France on Jan. 12th (as ""Le Château Ambulant,"" natch), and I saw it at an avant-première. As a raving fan of Miyazaki and of Diana Wynne Jones, I feel lucky to be an American living in France -- I see there's no release date announced yet for the U.S. Sorry, folks, and blame Disney! I understand the feelings of viewers who have criticized the movie as trite. I find it's less imaginative, in terms of character development and emotional profundity, than Miyazaki's best masterpieces. However, even a pedestrian Miyazaki movie is infinitely more rich, frightening, imaginative and humane than any six Disney films put together, and there's a lot to love in ""Howl's Moving Castle."" I am glad I didn't reread Jones' book before seeing the film; even going on my six-year-old memory of the novel, I can see the movie's a very loose adaptation, and I think Jones fans would do best to try to take the movie on its own merits instead of looking for a faithful adaptation. That said, Miyazaki is surprisingly successful, at moments, in capturing the richness of the novel's characters: the peculiar co-habitation of charm and terror in Howl the sorcerer and his demon companion Calcifer, and the pragmatic strength of will that makes us love Sophie, the protagonist, who embodies both the fairy-tale archetypes of the young girl and the old woman at once.Miyazaki's directorial trademarks are here in spades. Most of them lend strength and power to the film: his passion for open landscapes, his vision of the power and horror of war, the uncompromised way his movies work to empower children, and especially girls. A few of them are just Miyazaki quirks that fans will recognize with amusement (walrus mustaches, cobbled European squares, and flying machines for everyone!) Richer and stranger, though, are the very successful integration of two things that Disney animation never even approaches: the way even a children's story can blur lines between an enemy and a friend, and the cohabitation of the monstrous and the sublime. Enemy, ally, monster, beloved: Miyazaki gives both visual and moral weight to these disturbing contradictions, and certain scenes in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" evoke a frightening sublimity I have never seen elsewhere than in ""Princess Mononoke."" I think the film suffers from a slightly hurried pace, especially with respect to the protagonists' character development, and the result is a loss of the subtlety that makes Jones' book such a gripping fairy tale. Her Howl is more ambivalent, and her story is a more complex investigation of adolescent heartlessness and the growth of the heart. The ending, which falls back too much on clichéd imagery and deus-ex-machina, also could have been better handled. All that said, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" contains lots of treasures and will, I think, stand up to repeated viewings. Miyazaki fans will be delighted, and kids around the world should be given the chance to taste this latest rich, respectful children's tale. (Be warned, though: there are moments as terrifying as those in ""Princess Mononoke,"" and younger kids will need their parents with them.) On a final note, as few hardcore fans of Japanese anime will need to be reminded, the movie is doubtless best seen in its original version with subtitles. The Japanese voice acting is terrific -- although the voice of ""young Sophie"" doesn't strike me as anything special, the actors playing the aged Sophie, Howl, and especially Calcifer are fantastic. Calcifer is a magnificent creation and should delight even the most conservative fan of the novel. I have serious doubts that the inevitable English-language dub will do the nuances justice.",terrific miyazaki although not his best,howls moving castle opened here france jan 12th as le ch teau ambulant natch i saw it at avant premi re as raving fan miyazaki diana wynne jones i feel lucky be american living france i see theres no release date announced yet u s sorry folks blame disney i understand feelings viewers who have criticized movie as trite i find its less imaginative terms character development emotional profundity than miyazakis best masterpieces however even pedestrian miyazaki movie is infinitely more rich frightening imaginative humane than any six disney films put together theres lot love howls moving castle i am glad i didnt reread jones book before seeing film even going my six year old memory novel i can see movies very loose adaptation i think jones fans would do best try take movie its own merits instead looking faithful adaptation that said miyazaki is surprisingly successful at moments capturing richness novels characters peculiar co habitation charm terror howl sorcerer his demon companion calcifer pragmatic strength will that makes us love sophie protagonist who embodies both fairy tale archetypes young girl old woman at once miyazakis directorial trademarks are here spades most them lend strength power film his passion open landscapes his vision power horror war uncompromised way his movies work empower children especially girls few them are just miyazaki quirks that fans will recognize with amusement walrus mustaches cobbled european squares flying machines everyone richer stranger though are very successful integration two things that disney animation never even approaches way even childrens story can blur lines between enemy friend cohabitation monstrous sublime enemy ally monster beloved miyazaki gives both visual moral weight these disturbing contradictions certain scenes howls moving castle evoke frightening sublimity i have never seen elsewhere than princess mononoke i think film suffers slightly hurried pace especially with respect protagonists character development result is loss subtlety that makes jones book such gripping fairy tale her howl is more ambivalent her story is more complex investigation adolescent heartlessness growth heart ending which falls back too much clich d imagery deus ex machina also could have been better handled all that said howls moving castle contains lots treasures will i think stand up repeated viewings miyazaki fans will be delighted kids around world should be given chance taste this latest rich respectful childrens tale be warned though there are moments as terrifying as those princess mononoke younger kids will need their parents with them final note as few hardcore fans japanese anime will need be reminded movie is doubtless best seen its original version with subtitles japanese voice acting is terrific although voice young sophie doesnt strike me as anything special actors playing aged sophie howl especially calcifer are fantastic calcifer is magnificent creation should delight even most conservative fan novel i have serious doubts that inevitable english language dub will do nuances justice,0.5603741496598639,0.1969727891156462,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10,Original and Thoughtful,"Now I know why everyone was excited about Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar winning animation, because his new Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from a British novel by Diana Wynne Jones, is more original and thoughtful than any American entry in that genre. The visuals of flat, classic animation with slow-moving characters and painterly backgrounds are alone worth the experience, the castle itself an imaginative hodgepodge of chicken-legged monsters from Russian folklore and cumbersome war machines from Star Wars. As the director has said, ""I've told the people on my CGI staff not to be accurate, not to be true. We're making a mystery here, so make it mysterious.""The plot is almost inscrutable as it depicts a kind of late nineteenth-century European city in which hat shop girl Sophie alternately is wooed by a cute wizard, Howl, and cursed by a witch to be shifted into an old crone's body. Her Dorothy-like wandering with, among others, a pogo-sticked scarecrow, takes her to the titular castle of Howl, where she cleans, keeps order, and longs for Howl. Ultimately she confronts a sorceress, Madam Suliman. War ensues but can't defeat the power of love.The real strength of Howl's Moving Castle is in character diversity and development with a vain, kind, and immature hero; villains morphing into lovable friends and a fire that talks like Billy Crystal and surpasses Eddie Murphy's wisecracking donkey. These are just some of the touches of this hip Asian anime that comments on the folly of war promoted by very neocon-like leaders and the endlessly interesting conflicts between the good and bad angels of each character. Shape-shifting heroine Sophie says, ""I don't want to live if I can't be beautiful!"" Now there's my kind of self-centered lady, heroic and callow in the same film.No one-dimensional characters for this director, perhaps the most gifted animator in the world.",original thoughtful,now i know why everyone was excited about spirited away hayao miyazakis oscar winning animation because his new howls moving castle adapted british novel by diana wynne jones is more original thoughtful than any american entry that genre visuals flat classic animation with slow moving characters painterly backgrounds are alone worth experience castle itself imaginative hodgepodge chicken legged monsters russian folklore cumbersome war machines star wars as director has said ive told people my cgi staff not be accurate not be true were making mystery here so make it mysterious plot is almost inscrutable as it depicts kind late nineteenth century european city which hat shop girl sophie alternately is wooed by cute wizard howl cursed by witch be shifted into old crones body her dorothy like wandering with among others pogo sticked scarecrow takes her titular castle howl where she cleans keeps order longs howl ultimately she confronts sorceress madam suliman war ensues but cant defeat power love real strength howls moving castle is character diversity development with vain kind immature hero villains morphing into lovable friends fire that talks like billy crystal surpasses eddie murphys wisecracking donkey these are just some touches this hip asian anime that comments folly war promoted by very neocon like leaders endlessly interesting conflicts between good bad angels each character shape shifting heroine sophie says i dont want live if i cant be beautiful now theres my kind self centered lady heroic callow same film no one dimensional characters this director perhaps most gifted animator world,0.5282491582491582,0.24976430976430966,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.29}"

3,Loose Ends Ruined It For Me,"Having little experience in the Anime realm, I have to admit I'm probably not the most knowledgeable reviewer to examine a film such as this. But what I DO feel I'm fairly qualified to do is to evaluate stories. Animated or not, films are a valued method of reaching out to viewers and creating entertainment.Although HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE had some great animation and interesting concepts, the story was so nonsensical in so many places that I found myself shaking my head wondering why I was watching it.The story (if I'm not mistaken) is about Sophie, a young milliner (hatmaker) who lives a mundane life until she's afflicted by a curse put upon her by the (initially) evil Witch of the Waste. The curse comes in the form of age, turning Sophie instantly from a vibrant young girl into a ancient old hag. In order to break the spell, she must find Howl and his moving castle. But with the curse comes the added insult that she cannot tell anyone about it. So once our heroine meets up with Howl, she's unable to tell him what she needs and instead becomes the moving castle's housekeeper.Within the house she finds a young boy who wants to be just like Howl. She also meets and befriends the power that helps keep Howl's castle constantly on the go: a type of fire called Calcifer. And with the castle comes a multitude of problems: Howl's carelessness and difficulties of ""the heart"", a war against outside forces, and the threat of the Witch of the Waste.Again, the animation in the film was great. It was excellently colored and moved in an almost Van Goghish fashion across the screen. But oh the story! There's never an explanation given as to the war that is constantly circling this strange land. Why and how it got started are never fully explained, even though much screen time is given to the machines of war. Why and how the young boy who lives in Howl's castle came to be there are never explained either. Nor is any explanation given to the powers of Calcifer, the fire that drives the castle (the ending touches on it slightly but very ineffectually.) There are plenty of other non-sequiturs but those are the biggest. Too bad, really, as there were some great voices amongst the cast ...from Christian Bale, Billy Crystal and Lauren Bacall just to name a few.I don't mind films that leave a certain amount of exposition up to the viewers interpretation, but there needs to be some rhyme and/or reason for the basic constructs of a movie.

9,loaded with enough imagination and sweet vibes for three movies!,"I can't say for certain, especially after only seeing the English-language dub of the film in the theater (and seeing bits of it again on TV)- that Howl's Moving Castle is one of the very best of the great Hayao Miyazaki's feature films. But I didn't leave it feeling un-happy in the slightest, and if anything I remember most the feeling of uplift, which is what the best fairy tales try to accomplish. It follows the strand left by Spirited Away (though also trailing off from other Miyazaki films to be sure) where a female character is the protagonist thrust into strange circumstances, really around a curse.Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer and the great Jean Simmons in the English dub) gets cursed by an evil witch, and then meets up at Howl's castle (Howl, by the way, is a slightly melancholy and quirky wizard, voiced in a fun way by Christian Bale), and sets about to make herself useful, however to also keep order in the guide of her now old-lady persona (and, more importantly, to free herself from the curse). She also has to contend with an overly cautious flame (Billy Crystal, odd choice for a talking fire, but it works better than I expected), and a scarecrow who sometimes just can't sit still.Soon Sophie becomes the unwitting assistant to Howl, as she goes in partial disguise to help him be present instead of him before his former tutor, Madame Suliman. And, of course, in the meantime, a love story unfolds. Although I could argue that Howl's Moving Castle begins to stray a little from the completely satisfying world portrayed in Spirited Away or particularly in Princess Mononoke- and that the story is given way, frustrations and all, for the visual wonderment- it's still a delight from start to finish. While I wondered when I first saw it if the Japanese dialog would make a difference by much, seeing the American voices didn't detract much at all, and if anything the cast fulfills the story more than one could hope for. And, of course, those visual inventions are never to be taken for granted in Miyazaki's world (more than likely attributable to the source from Diana Wynne Jones and leaning more to Western influence then the decidedly awesomely Eastern Mononoke). If anything individual moments, like when Howl almost melts away from not having certain powers, is really intriguing, or in just seeing the castle itself, with all of the little parts and spindles a marvel in and of itself (Ebert's not far off from saying that it's one of the great unique places of the movies, and for me almost resides on the other industrial side of the cutesy wonderment of Totoro).I definitely need to watch it again, as Miyazaki's worlds usually do, but for now I do recommend it, even if you've never seen one of his films. Little girls too, I'd imagine, might get an extra kick out of the strong-willed female lead and the strong romantic interests in the storyline (and having a handsome leading man voiced by Bale doesn't hurt either).",loaded with enough imagination sweet vibes three movies,i cant say certain especially after only seeing english language dub film theater seeing bits it again tv that howls moving castle is one very best great hayao miyazakis feature films but i didnt leave it feeling un happy slightest if anything i remember most feeling uplift which is what best fairy tales try accomplish it follows strand left by spirited away though also trailing off other miyazaki films be sure where female character is protagonist thrust into strange circumstances really around curse sophie voiced by emily mortimer great jean simmons english dub gets cursed by evil witch then meets up at howls castle howl by way is slightly melancholy quirky wizard voiced fun way by christian bale sets about make herself useful however also keep order guide her now old lady persona more importantly free herself curse she also has contend with overly cautious flame billy crystal odd choice talking fire but it works better than i expected scarecrow who sometimes just cant sit still soon sophie becomes unwitting assistant howl as she goes partial disguise help him be present instead him before his former tutor madame suliman course meantime love story unfolds although i could argue that howls moving castle begins stray little completely satisfying world portrayed spirited away or particularly princess mononoke that story is given way frustrations all visual wonderment its still delight start finish while i wondered when i first saw it if japanese dialog would make difference by much seeing american voices didnt detract much at all if anything cast fulfills story more than one could hope course those visual inventions are never be taken granted miyazakis world more than likely attributable source diana wynne jones leaning more western influence then decidedly awesomely eastern mononoke if anything individual moments like when howl almost melts away not having certain powers is really intriguing or just seeing castle itself with all little parts spindles marvel itself eberts not far off saying that its one great unique places movies me almost resides other industrial side cutesy wonderment totoro i definitely need watch it again as miyazakis worlds usually do but now i do recommend it even if youve never seen one his films little girls too id imagine might get extra kick out strong willed female lead strong romantic interests storyline having handsome leading man voiced by bale doesnt hurt either,0.466501133786848,0.19915816326530608,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.32}"

Now she accompanied Howl and his moving castle and they went through a journey to help each other during the midst of a war.What I liked about the movie was the stunning visuals. The color and dynamic objects burst life into the movie. However, among the spectacle lied the changes in the two main characters who matured and changed their outlooks on life.The main female character, Sophie, got turned into an old woman, and this sudden leap transformed her character to becoming more confident. This reflects the theme of old age. Miyazaki showed that being old is not bad. Instead, it makes a person more mature, confident, and compassionate.The main male character, Howl, also matured as he remembered his identity and understood responsibility.An obvious theme is the anti-war sentiment. The visual, with its glorious spectacle, also showed the ugly side of war where bombs destroyed houses and people. This is a strong over-arching theme.My main problem with the movie was its fairly fast pace.

9,Another classic from Studio Ghibli,"Once again Hayao Miyazaki has provided us with a beautifully animated film which can be enjoyed by people of most ages; very young children might find one or two scenes a little scary though.As with all of his films the animation is stunning and the characters are interesting. Once again the main character is a girl, in this case Sophie a young hat maker. One day when she is out she gets slightly harassed by two soldiers but is rescued from this predicament by the wizard Howl who it turns out is fleeing from strange blob-like creatures sent after him by the Witch of the Waste. They escape by flying away from them but soon after the witch visits Sophie in her shop and turns her into an old woman.After being cursed she heads out in to the wastes where she finds a scarecrow who brings the moving castle of the title to her. The castle is a wonderful creation that is hard to describe, it is a bit like a building that has been constructed by lumping several other buildings together and putting them on legs so it can walk about.Once inside sits by the fire to get warm and discovers it is no ordinary fire but a fire demon called Calcifer and that it is he who powers the castle after being trapped by Howl in exchange for his heart. Calcifer recognises that Sophie is cursed and offers to beak her spell if she can break his and thus free him.The castle has a strange door that opens into a variety of places including two cities that are in countries that are at war. In one city they think the wizard Jenkins lives behind the door and in the other they think it is the wizard Pendragon, of course both these are in fact aliases of Howl. Rather awkwardly for Howl both ""Jenkins"" and ""Pendragon"" are summoned by the kings of the respective countries to help with the war effort. Obviously there are plenty more things that happen but I don't want to spoiler the whole film.Howl isn't the standard cartoon hero, in fact he isn't that heroic at all, he is incredibly vain and he wants nothing to do with the war apart from to end it although he does fight against attacking planes.As one would expect from Hayao Miyazaki there are plenty of exciting flying scenes involving aircraft that could only work in an animated film.

8,glorious visuals,"What do you get when you combine the master Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki (""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Spirited Away"") with the British sci-fi novelist Diana Wynne Jones? The answer is ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" an enchanting (if not altogether understandable) animated feature, filled with beauty, imagination and magic.Sophie is a shy young girl, working in her family's hat shop, who falls under the spell of a witch who turns her into a decrepit old woman. At a loss as to what to do, Sophie decides to leave home and try to find a cure for her condition in the mysterious land of wizards and witches that lies just outside her city. Not long after she arrives, she encounters the mysterious ""moving castle,"" owned by the enigmatic wizard known as Howl, that not only roams freely around the countryside but seems to exist in any number of different dimensions at the same time. It's when she passes through the castle door and discovers what awaits her inside that the really surreal adventure begins.There's little point in trying to figure out all the fine details of the story, which often feels as if it is being made up as it goes along - and not always in a way that is completely satisfying to those of us who are trying desperately to understand it. Yet, there is a certain fascination in the way the film chooses to defy all the rules of time and space and feels no real compunction to explain how all of it is supposed to work. The movie asks us to merely accept what we are seeing at face value and to go along wherever it is it wants to take us. This is an easy thing to do, primarily because the film's incredible beauty seduces us into accepting the slightly weird alternate reality the movie has set up for us. Although the animators are all Japanese, the characters themselves are Occidental and the film appears to be set sometime in the late Victorian or early Edwardian era of a century ago. The visuals are so exquisite in every detail that it is virtually impossible for us to turn our eyes from the screen even for a split second. Like the best animated films, it transports us to a world that is both utterly fantastic and strangely familiar at the same time.In bringing the characters to life, the English-language version employs an impressive cast of voices, including veterans Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner, along with Billy Crystal, Emily Mortimer and Christian Bale.With its occasionally incoherent storyline and deliberate pacing, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" may disappoint and frustrate those accustomed to the more simple, hectic and frenetic animated films churned out regularly by Hollywood. But if you're in the mood for a calmer, more relaxing trip to a world not your own, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" provides just the right vehicle to take you there.",glorious visuals,what do you get when you combine master japanese director hayao miyazaki my neighbor totoro spirited away with british sci fi novelist diana wynne jones answer is howls moving castle enchanting if not altogether understandable animated feature filled with beauty imagination magic sophie is shy young girl working her familys hat shop who falls under spell witch who turns her into decrepit old woman at loss as what do sophie decides leave home try find cure her condition mysterious land wizards witches that lies just outside her city not long after she arrives she encounters mysterious moving castle owned by enigmatic wizard known as howl that not only roams freely around countryside but seems exist any number different dimensions at same time its when she passes through castle door discovers what awaits her inside that really surreal adventure begins theres little point trying figure out all fine details story which often feels as if it is being made up as it goes along not always way that is completely satisfying those us who are trying desperately understand it yet there is certain fascination way film chooses defy all rules time space feels no real compunction explain how all it is supposed work movie asks us merely accept what we are seeing at face value go along wherever it is it wants take us this is easy thing do primarily because films incredible beauty seduces us into accepting slightly weird alternate reality movie has set up us although animators are all japanese characters themselves are occidental film appears be set sometime late victorian or early edwardian era century ago visuals are so exquisite every detail that it is virtually impossible us turn our eyes screen even split second like best animated films it transports us world that is both utterly fantastic strangely familiar at same time bringing characters life english language version employs impressive cast voices including veterans jean simmons lauren bacall blythe danner along with billy crystal emily mortimer christian bale with its occasionally incoherent storyline deliberate pacing howls moving castle may disappoint frustrate those accustomed more simple hectic frenetic animated films churned out regularly by hollywood but if youre mood calmer more relaxing trip world not your own howls moving castle provides just right vehicle take you there,0.5321805645335057,0.14991830065359477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9,They tried to save each other ...,"I saw this twice, because there was no way I could understand the plot (especially in the second half) after only seeing it once. The first time around I got too carried away watching the animation, but the second viewing helped me understand the story a lot better, as I managed to pay more attention to all the dialogues.Honestly though I still don't know exactly what happened in the last half an hour or so. I'm going to read the book, and I'm sure I will enjoy it but don't know how useful it's going to be. The film's said to be wildly different from the original setting.It really doesn't matter, because I don't seem to mind seeing the film once again (& again). The animation is so beautiful & I find the characters cute gorgeous, funny & very heart-warming.*SPOILERS*I figure that the face of the old Sophie changes & she instantly looks younger when she feels excited / happy / alive, even as a very old woman (she looks young when asleep, but I wonder if it's only in Howl's vision).It breaks my heart that she looks sad & immediately turns back into the old Sophie when Howl tries to tell her sincerely ""you are beautiful"". But then both Howl & Sophie must fight the war to save each other & the rest of their newly-formed family incl. their old enemy & the dog. The curse is already gone by the time Sophie comes back to present from the past through the door, finds the wounded Bird Howl & kisses him. She won't look old any more.Still, I also like the fact that earlier in the film, after the initial shock, Sophie was clearly able to enjoy herself being old. Think she was already in love with Howl when he came back to the Castle & found her, but she didn't have to be nervous or anything because she knew she was no longer a shy 18-year-old.And Sophie's first encounter with Howl in the back street ... did he say ""There you are, SWEETHEART""? Has he actually been looking for Sophie ever since he (as a still very young boy) saw her & heard her cry FIND ME IN THE FUTURE. That's clever, and most romantic.",they tried save each other,i saw this twice because there was no way i could understand plot especially second half after only seeing it once first time around i got too carried away watching animation but second viewing helped me understand story lot better as i managed pay more attention all dialogues honestly though i still dont know exactly what happened last half hour or so im going read book im sure i will enjoy it but dont know how useful its going be films said be wildly different original setting it really doesnt matter because i dont seem mind seeing film once again again animation is so beautiful i find characters cute gorgeous funny very heart warming spoilers i figure that face old sophie changes she instantly looks younger when she feels excited happy alive even as very old woman she looks young when asleep but i wonder if its only howls vision it breaks my heart that she looks sad immediately turns back into old sophie when howl tries tell her sincerely you are beautiful but then both howl sophie must fight war save each other rest their newly formed family incl their old enemy dog curse is already gone by time sophie comes back present past through door finds wounded bird howl kisses him she wont look old any more still i also like fact that earlier film after initial shock sophie was clearly able enjoy herself being old think she was already love with howl when he came back castle found her but she didnt have be nervous or anything because she knew she was no longer shy 18 year old sophies first encounter with howl back street did he say there you are sweetheart has he actually been looking sophie ever since he as still very young boy saw her heard her cry find me future thats clever most romantic,0.43158890492223817,0.17428090428090426,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.2}"
8,Howl if you like Howl's Moving Castle!! WOOOOO!!!,"I like the movie, but the film is way too different than the book to the point that it was a bit annoying. They change too many things. The story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. It's like taking 1939's Wizard of Oz and turning it into turning it into Sci-Fi's Tin Man (2007). It's a re-imagining of Dianne Wynne Jones's classic novel. Don't get me wrong, I love Hayao Miyazaki's vision of the book, Howl's Moving castle; I just wish it would had stay more true to Diana Wynne Jones's novel. This movie marks the first time Miyazaki has adapted another writer's work since Kiki's Delivery Service (1989). It is a really fascinating work with lively characters and incredible imagination through out the film. Sophie (Emily Mortimer/Chieko Baisho), a 19-year-old hat maker who is taking away by the charm of a Wizard name Howl (Takuya Kimura/ Christian Bale) when she was rescue by him when she was trying to visit her sister. For punishment for trying to steal her favorite's wizard's heart, The Witch of the Waste (Akihiro Miwa/ Lauren Bacall) transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. In her old, Sophie (Jean Simmons) must searches for a way to break the Witch's spell. On the way, she makes some new friends: Markl (Ryunosuke Kamiki/Josh Hutcherson), Howl's young apprentice, a scarecrow nickname Turliphead, and last Calcifer (Tatsuya Gashun/ Billy Crystal). The visuals in the movie are amazing. It's a steam punk fan's favorite, the way, Miyazaki use CG to creates a ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment, but held together by the burning heart of magic is interesting. The film is overflows with eclipsing visuals that range from frightening aerial battles to serene landscapes, and interesting details of everything around. There is also the major themes that Miyazaki's works been known for such as such as environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, and the absence of villains. Miyazaki's Howl has a very strong female protagonist that go against gender roles common in Japanese animation and fiction. Both old and young Sophie were very interesting. I love Jean Simmon's voice as old Sophie. She gives some charm and funny moments. I love the stairs scene. I was laughing my head off. The dubbing by English actors match pretty damn good. Good job, Pixar. I love the English dub more than the Japanese since it's based on a English novel. The Japanese just looks a bit odd with the European themes in this film. The plot in the film is secondary, as it's nearly makes no sense and full of plot-holes. Things are mention at the last moment or not fully disclosure toward the end. There is nothing about Wales, no reference, no mention, no allusion to the place where the novel came from. The fate of a lost prince sub-plot comes nowhere in left field toward the end. Miyazaki turned the the story into a protest against the war in Iraq. I have nothing against anti-war propaganda, believe me, but let's call it what it is, and not try to trick people into pulling out cash from their pockets for what they assume is a film version of one of their favorite books. The story is utterly unrecognizable from the original. Several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. Sophie doesn't have her sorceress powers that allow her to turn things into living objects. While the Witch of the Waste is the villain in the book; the movie instead made her, into a weak, harmless woman. Then it made the male Suliman (Haruko Kato/ Blythe Danner) a alley in the novel into a female enemy in the film. Still, there are some changes I do like. I like Howl portrayed as a deep troubled hero rather than the arrogant self-centered wizard he is in the book. Still there is a bit of that self-centered narcissism attitude in him in the film. Reminds me a lot of the story Beauty and the Beast. I like how Calcifer is a cute cheeky little orange flame instead of an evil menacing fire demon. Overall: You have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him. If you are a fan of the book, steer well clear.",howl if you like howls moving castle wooooo,i like movie but film is way too different than book point that it was bit annoying they change too many things story becomes something utterly unrecognizable original several key characters are lumped together most confusingly others lose all their complex charm its like taking 1939s wizard oz turning it into turning it into sci fis tin man 2007 its re imagining dianne wynne joness classic novel dont get me wrong i love hayao miyazakis vision book howls moving castle i just wish it would had stay more true diana wynne joness novel this movie marks first time miyazaki has adapted another writers work since kikis delivery service 1989 it is really fascinating work with lively characters incredible imagination through out film sophie emily mortimer chieko baisho 19 year old hat maker who is taking away by charm wizard name howl takuya kimura christian bale when she was rescue by him when she was trying visit her sister punishment trying steal her favorites wizards heart witch waste akihiro miwa lauren bacall transforms her into 90 year old woman her old sophie jean simmons must searches way break witchs spell way she makes some new friends markl ryunosuke kamiki josh hutcherson howls young apprentice scarecrow nickname turliphead last calcifer tatsuya gashun billy crystal visuals movie are amazing its steam punk fans favorite way miyazaki use cg creates ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment but held together by burning heart magic is interesting film is overflows with eclipsing visuals that range frightening aerial battles serene landscapes interesting details everything around there is also major themes that miyazakis works been known such as such as environmentalism pacifism feminism absence villains miyazakis howl has very strong female protagonist that go against gender roles common japanese animation fiction both old young sophie were very interesting i love jean simmons voice as old sophie she gives some charm funny moments i love stairs scene i was laughing my head off dubbing by english actors match pretty damn good good job pixar i love english dub more than japanese since its based english novel japanese just looks bit odd with european themes this film plot film is secondary as its nearly makes no sense full plot holes things are mention at last moment or not fully disclosure toward end there is nothing about wales no reference no mention no allusion place where novel came fate lost prince sub plot comes nowhere left field toward end miyazaki turned story into protest against war iraq i have nothing against anti war propaganda believe me but lets call it what it is not try trick people into pulling out cash their pockets what they assume is film version one their favorite books story is utterly unrecognizable original several key characters are lumped together most confusingly others lose all their complex charm sophie doesnt have her sorceress powers that allow her turn things into living objects while witch waste is villain book movie instead made her into weak harmless woman then it made male suliman haruko kato blythe danner alley novel into female enemy film still there are some changes i do like i like howl portrayed as deep troubled hero rather than arrogant self centered wizard he is book still there is bit that self centered narcissism attitude him film reminds me lot story beauty beast i like how calcifer is cute cheeky little orange flame instead evil menacing fire demon overall you have never read book are fan miyazaki by all means buy this youre very likely enjoy excellent animation yet another unusual story him if you are fan book steer well clear,0.49258754208754213,0.11303956228956223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"
6,...huh?,"Maybe the only way to enjoy this movie is to think of it more as a visual symphony than a cohesive narrative? Like fantasia or something? I had soooo many questions I needed answers for, and while I got some of them from the ending, for the most part I'm just left scratching my head and wondering what the heck I just watched. Seriously, not even plot holes, just missing pieces of plot; so much information is never given and its absence is felt. Is the war somehow Howl's fault? Where the heck did Sophie's mom come from? Who was the witch? Who was the other witch? Is Sophie a witch? Why did the first witch curse Sophie? Why was the second witch so mad? Was she mad or am I projecting? On and on it goes. Sigh. 6/10 Stars. All in all I think that it's a very pretty movie, with decent animation, but there are better Ghibli films for both animation and story.",huh,maybe only way enjoy this movie is think it more as visual symphony than cohesive narrative like fantasia or something i had soooo many questions i needed answers while i got some them ending most part im just left scratching my head wondering what heck i just watched seriously not even plot holes just missing pieces plot so much information is never given its absence is felt is war somehow howls fault where heck did sophies mom come who was witch who was other witch is sophie witch why did first witch curse sophie why was second witch so mad was she mad or am i projecting it goes sigh 6 10 stars all all i think that its very pretty movie with decent animation but there are better ghibli films both animation story,0.46271929824561403,0.10109649122807016,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10,Thank you so much for this movie Mr. Miyazaki,"I Don't get words to express what I felt when coming out of the cinema, Howl's Moving Castle is an absolutely fantastic film and has even out Laputa and Totoro as my favourite Miyazaki film.The story is amazing and the characters and creatures are as excellently crafted and fun to watch as ever. The voice actors and music are perfect Joe Hisaishi in my opinion is the best contemporary composer.My only criticism (very little) is maybe the ending (last minutes) that rises suddenly, far from the habitual perfection of the catharsis final of the Miyazaki's films but nothing importantThe movie has a really bad thing of the film: THE LONG WAITING TO SEE IT AGAIN!ESSENTIAL",thank you so much this movie mr miyazaki,i dont get words express what i felt when coming out cinema howls moving castle is absolutely fantastic film has even out laputa totoro as my favourite miyazaki film story is amazing characters creatures are as excellently crafted fun watch as ever voice actors music are perfect joe hisaishi my opinion is best contemporary composer my only criticism very little is maybe ending last minutes that rises suddenly far habitual perfection catharsis final miyazakis films but nothing importantthe movie has really bad thing film long waiting see it again essential,0.609375,0.23580729166666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.29}"
