,Great movie,"An excellent movie and a definite must see. Great plot, screenplay, direction and cast - with just the right amount of Nana. Goes to show that Bollywood can produce movies of cinematic brilliance second to none. I saw shades of Training Day in the beginning of this movie (corrupt cop showing the ropes to a rookie cop), but the similarities ended there. IMHO, Nana did a way more credible job than Denzel's overhyped and overrated Oscar winning performance. A very serious and realistic movie, but not very dark and it did not treat the subject with a heavy-hand. I think this was why the movie moved along at a good pace, and always kept the viewer involved. Gets bonus points for having a white person on screen that can actually speak English [if you've heard white people speak English in Hindi movies, you know what I'm talking about]. A very solid 9/10.",great movie,excellent movie definite must see great plot screenplay direction cast with just right amount nana goes show that bollywood can produce movies cinematic brilliance second none i saw shades training day beginning this movie corrupt cop showing ropes rookie cop but similarities ended there imho nana did way more credible job than denzels overhyped overrated oscar winning performance very serious realistic movie but not very dark it did not treat subject with heavy hand i think this was why movie moved along at good pace always kept viewer involved gets bonus points having white person screen that can actually speak english very solid 9 10,0.4693685679399965,0.18619396476539332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
7.0,Nana Patekar steals another movie,"Nana Patekar once again proves that he is the best actor working in Bombay without a doubt. His recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not bode well for the theater trained thespian. One wonders why he is always not given his accolades during awards season.""Shakti-The Power"" was one of his flicks that was an utter disapointment along with Kohram (a missed oppurtunity to create screen magic with Amitabh Bachchan).But Patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey. Ridding the streets of Bombay of underworld dons in fake encounters, Patekars character takes control of the screen (and the viewers attention) and never lets go. The editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story.Along the same lines as the modern day cult classic ""Company"", the movie is well acted, directed and should have a long shelf life on DVD. The final ten minutes that see Nana and the main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound to be part of Hindi cinema classics. Won't be dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick.",nana patekar steals another movie,nana patekar once again proves that he is best actor working bombay without doubt his recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not bode well theater trained thespian one wonders why he is always not given his accolades during awards season shakti power was one his flicks that was utter disapointment along with kohram missed oppurtunity create screen magic with amitabh bachchan but patekar exudes cool calm this film playing cop sort social justice journey ridding streets bombay underworld dons fake encounters patekars character takes control screen viewers attention never lets go editing is tightly paced there are no annoying songs distract story along same lines as modern day cult classic company movie is well acted directed should have long shelf life dvd final ten minutes that see nana main villain talk at his offshore haven are bound be part hindi cinema classics wont be dissapointed with this cops robbers flick,0.4737433862433863,0.14933862433862435,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.47}"
9.0,"""Hum sab system ka hissa hain. System decide karta hai. Apun follow karta hai.""","I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite ""Company"" (which was a very good effort) and ""Vaastav"" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself ""Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now"". The quote by Nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film. What strikes you about the ""encounter"" at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out. There is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine.Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted. With simple shots and camera angles, director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie. Editing seems non-existent and hence effective. The music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you've left the movie hall.But for me, what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character. Sandeep Srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer. If I start listing my favourite dialogues, I'm afraid I'll end up re-writing the entire script of the movie.The movie boasts of some stellar performances. Yashpal Sharma is detestable as Sub-Inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and so is Jeeva as Joint Commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as the rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster  Oh My God! He learns under the tutelage of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believes in him.Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing. Never before in Indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster.Not that I have not been a fan of Nana Patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindi cinema. From the way he talks to his expressions, from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea  it's almost as if Nana can do no wrong. He is at his best in each and every scene especially when he's teaching Jatin about how the police force functions. His cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times. His dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country. It's a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one.Last but in no way the least, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there, Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment. I just hope that he continues the great work and doesn't give in to Bollywood-isation! If he can do that, I'm sure he'll be a force to reckon with in the coming years.",hum sab system ka hissa hain system decide karta hai apun follow karta hai,i still remember watching satya first time i was completely blown away here was movie that was very different so other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya so believable despite company which was very good effort vaastav more focused journey protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up satya when i watched ab tak 56 first time i said myself indian cops have their own satya now quote by nietzsche beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about encounter at start film is relaxed manner which it is carried out there is cold scary feel it cos you realize that it is part their routine ab tak 56 is not story honest cop or corrupt cop but cop who is ready do what it takes get rid criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots camera angles director shimit amin manages capture essence characters gives realistic rough feel movie editing seems non existent hence effective music is also impressive haunting stays with you long after youve left movie hall but me what really takes cake are dialogues superlative acting each every character sandeep srivastava has done brilliant job as dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues im afraid ill end up re writing entire script movie movie boasts some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as sub inspector imtiaz siddiqui so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play perfection nakul vaid as rookie jatin shukla was revelation scene where he has hesitantly shoot wounded gangster oh my god he learns under tutelage sadhu aghashe firmly believes him prasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive his conversations with sadhu are real jewels dialogue writing never before indian cinema has any film brought out such beautiful relation between cop gangster not that i have not been fan nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me fan devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives performance lifetime one best ive ever seen hindi cinema way he talks his expressions way he taps his cigarette way sips his tea its almost as if nana can do no wrong he is at his best each every scene especially when hes teaching jatin about how police force functions his cool composed manner doing things is scary at times his dialogue delivery body language had me convinced that he is one finest actors country its shame that he did not win any popular awards this one last but no way least shimit amin does brilliant job bringing all this talent together exploiting them fullest come up with modern masterpiece indian cinema industry that is sickeningly accustomed lifting stories here there amin takes original script brings it life with beautiful treatment i just hope that he continues great work doesnt give bollywood isation if he can do that im sure hell be force reckon with coming years,0.6054648526077095,0.18579816017316017,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8.0,The most definitive film on cops,"It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and superb performances (even by those with little job to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And so are the small events like an insider not giving information to Imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker, but only to Nana when he is out. The change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt wonderfully. The first half keeps one absolutely engrossed, moving like a documentary with Nana acting like a mentor to Jatin explaining to him the intricacies and philosophy of the work.Overall one of the most brilliant films on cops in Indian cinema. Definitely not to be missed.",most definitive film cops,it is by far most definitive film police force which i have seen although not directed by ram gopal varma it has all elements rgv film dead straight dialogues blunt treatment subject brilliant direction superb performances even by those with little job do movie chemistry between nana don even if they are professional rivals is amazing so are small events like insider not giving information imtiaz even while he is being bashed up locker but only nana when he is out change working conditions with change senior is dealt wonderfully first half keeps one absolutely engrossed moving like documentary with nana acting like mentor jatin explaining him intricacies philosophy work overall one most brilliant films cops indian cinema definitely not be missed,0.5196969696969697,0.21723484848484853,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.57}"
8.0,Fictional story based on a very real cop...,"No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real ""encounter"" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead ""Sadhu Agashe"" has killed"" - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory. Movies which are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan meanders close to very good. But yet remains one of the Top 70 films released from India, commercial and artsy included.What is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally (in an Indian flick) how the police network works. The cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell (though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny) The producers are trying for a Cannes release, which is interesting. Made by debut director Shamit Aman (i think thats his name).Again 55 y.o. Nana Patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past, just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief. Again Patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie- relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialoges, good acting, nice direction all in all Great stuff.

6.0,Close Encounter of the Good Cinema Kind.,"Nana Patekar, the ""Morgan Freeman"" of Indian Cinema, has given some great perfs. as a village head in ""Shakti"", a mute in ""Khamoshi"". No one with an eye for good acting can miss the brilliance of this performer. A good script,a good supporting cast like Revathi, Yashpal Sharma, a crisp editing and direction makes this movie a winner. There are some great scenes and dialog-like when he first meets Zameer and explains him the ""nuisance value,"" when he invites his subordinate for dinner and cooks ""Sambar"". The movie is dominated and sustained by Patekar, who takes you into the web of underworld-deceit,deception and corruption which may border on exxageration at some point but the outline to some extent is real life dilemma faced by the law enforcement. The word ""Encounter"" is a misnomer but it is accepted as most accept the word ""Bollywood"".

Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies.

7.0,Lots of style but unfocused,"Once again I must play something of the contrarian. Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive. Mine is positive, but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a ""C"" letter grade from me.It seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors: One, that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood film, and two, that it is trying to do things differently.The first point I couldn't care less about. I'm not looking for realism in films, and so I do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how I believe the real world to be--I'm a big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdism, and so on, although I do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist.For the second point, I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However, I don't think ""originality"" versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself. A film can be ""original"" and poor, just like a film can be formulaic and excellent. What matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer.Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai cop named Daya Naik. Naik was an ""encounter specialist"". Encounter specialists, who could be said to be early instantiations of real world ""Judge Dredds"", are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue, and they're basically given a license to kill--effectively acting as policeman, judge, jury and executioner in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar), the encounter specialist based on Naik. We see him at work, interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence. We see him at home, trying to live a normal life in his less-than-luxurious surroundings. We see him trying to adjust to a new ""commissioner"" halfway through the film. And we see his odd relationship with a notorious Indian gangster, Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare).All of this has the potential to make a fabulous, gritty film. I agree that it's nice to forgo the typical Bollywood musical numbers and romances--not every film needs that stuff; Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced. Additionally, Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances--Patekar almost gives off a Death Wish (1974)-era Charles Bronson vibe. It also has admirable cinematography--the hand-held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective, for example. It has a great score that mixes more of a moody Hollywood-sounding action/crime score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is well done and gritty.There is also decent exploration of subtexts, including the morality of (having) encounter specialists, the idea of following orders, and so on. The encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong. More poignantly, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and, say, members of a country's military, and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to.But (you just knew there was a ""But"" coming, didn't you?) director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters, far too much sprawl, and that moves a bit too slow. All of these problems may be due to Amin and crew looking at the Godfather films, which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) resemblances to, although from a policeman's perspective.Most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well--these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least, except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For one, Narayan, I didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film. His name is mentioned a number of times, but I'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change. Then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and I'd have to start all over figuring out who Narayan was.The same thing happened with Agashe's first commissioner. The film was already far into the new commissioner before I could figure out the relationships. It seems like there are new characters in every scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. While that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about (because they're mostly doing so on orders), since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists, either, it's difficult to find characters to care about, and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film.The primary villain is Zameer. But until about halfway through the film, there's no indication of this. He doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film, and he's literally ""phoning his performance in""--he's in another location (Dubai), communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film. We don't actually see Zameer doing much. To an extent, the film depends on a couple ""twists"" that necessitate not showing Zameer doing a number of things, but we could see him do other things, and a lot of the other villains could have been left out.That would have tightened up the film a bit, making it more focused and about a half-hour shorter, both of which would have benefited its impact. This is not an action-packed film by any means. For at least the first 45 minutes or so, I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style, but saying, ""Okay, get on with the story already"".",lots style but unfocused,once again i must play something contrarian most reviews ab tak chappan have been extremely positive mine is positive but only slightly 7 out 10 is equivalent c letter grade me it seems that lot praise is rooted two

times but id only get glimpses him until scene would change then everyone would change clothes by time they appear again id have start all over figuring out who narayan was same thing happened with agashes first commissioner film was already far into new commissioner before i could figure out relationships it seems like there are new characters every scene we never learn stories most them while that might have some artistic merit that encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about because theyre mostly doing so orders since we do not learn much about most encounter specialists either its difficult find characters care about that doesnt exactly make gripping film primary villain is zameer but until about halfway through film theres no indication this he doesnt get much more screen time than other villains parading through film hes literally phoning his performance hes another location dubai communicating only by telephone majority film we dont actually see zameer doing much extent film depends couple twists that necessitate not showing zameer doing number things but we could see him do other things lot other villains could have been left out that would have tightened up film bit making it more focused about half hour shorter both which would have benefited its impact this is not action packed film by any means at least first 45 minutes or so i found myself admiring ab tak chappans considerable style but saying okay get with story already,0.49724283652855095,0.1308730158730158,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07,

10.0,Best film so far from the Ram Gopal Varma factory....,"Satya was excellent.... Company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. Nana Pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. As a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on. I've ordered my DVD and can't wait to see it again at home.

There's no background information, no detailed explanation of events, etc.--just a straight cut to the chase. One by one, each of the plot's events take place in rapid succession leaving the audience with plenty to ponder about.

8.0,Extremely polished piece of film-making,"Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard working, hard-edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers, Imtiaz, becomes frustrated by Sadhu's high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. Further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics.I was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from India. The camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The acting, pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts.

8.0,"Engaging crime drama, Nana Patekar is awesome...","Crime drama genre is just like the chess game, if handled sensibly and very seriously. Its like you don't notice the motive or intention behind any move played by players ( in a movie, there are protagonist and antagonist) But as soon as the game comes towards climax, and protagonist checkmates the villain, you think of all those moves in sequence and how those moves trick the opponent to fall into his own trap. This game becomes more interesting and engaging when you get to know thinking behind every move played by the players. This is what director Shimit Amin achieved, with his brilliant direction, in this film by portraying each character and their role in main story which makes the movie one of the best crime drama movie.When you first see the poster and Nana Patekar in it with a tag line like ""If I have to think about what's right and what's wrong just like you guys (addressing to the readers), then Who will do it (the killing)"", u get the feeling that you will get to see something very interesting on the screen.The fearless encounter specialist, with very supportive commissioner of Mumbai Police Department to perform his duty without any restriction to clean the underworld and at the same time struggling to keep himself away from becoming a victim of jealousy of his own department member, faces difficulties while doing his job when a new commissioner is appointed. And execution of new orders from commissioner about an encounter leads to set a chain of incidents which create a gripping mind game.The depth in the character of Sadhu Agashe is wholeheartedly portrayed by legendary Nana Patekar with nuances and remarkable detailing. The dialogue delivery, body language and attitude of this actor is perfect for fearless Encounter Specialist. At the same time Nana Patekar portrays a loving family man, a protective father, frustrated cop. His facial expressions were outstanding while having a dialogue with his colleague about how cops are puppets of the politicians and system. All the other supporting actors play their role very well. Special mentions are Yashpal Sharma and Nakul Vaid.The character theme for Nana's character created by Salim-Sulaiman suits that character. The editing is tight and doesn't lose the hold and pace. Story and screenplay are awesome. Dialogues given to Nan's character are quirky and help build the character strongly. Dialoges between Nana and Don also add some humor in scenes. Cinematography is OK. Overall a good crime drama with magic touch of Nana Patekar is what Ab tak Chhapaan can be well described as.

6.0,A familiar cop story told interestingly.,"A familiar cop story told interestingly.It's the story of Sadhu Agashe as an encounter specialist and when he encounters a loss and then becomes more cold blooded and from cop to fugitive becomes lethal. Written and directed well by Shimit Amin, a director who writes well and directs the same superbly, this was his debut and how? Taking a well treaded path and make it more interesting and exploring a few niche things. The plot isn't original but the taking is. The way the climax is held and even 5 minutes before that, I did not expect it to end so menancingly as it is done, I must applaud the director here. The cinematography is too very stereotypical and follows its predecessors like Satya and others. The art direction, the costumes and the background score are good and simple, background went a bit overboard at times yet its just there aptly.Now Sadhu Agashe is a character that was as said 'inspired' from real life encounter specialist Dayanak just that the whole plot is fictionalised to take us through an engaging ride. Sadhu Agashe and for that matter most cops here are shown as sensitive and humane, like the Commissioner of police asking Sadhu, ""how is your son's fractured hand?"". Not sure if police are so humane but I will give in to most of such eccentricities in a plot that is a cold blooded revenge act. It has got a psychological thing as Sadhu Agashe tells his story through the induction a new cop into his team. More psychological would have more it less accessible and more interesting though, I liked it still the way it stands out now. Had production values been enhanced this was for sure then been a better watchable film.I will go with 3/5 for a good movie that could have been so much more.

6.0,Close encounters of the 'Specialist' kind,"This film based on the life of Mumbai Police Dept. Encounter Specialist Daya Naik and his band of mercenary cops, depicts the face offs between underworld dons and the CID (crime branch) plainclothes detectives, in which the latter have an upper hand with their direct-hit 'Shoot first, ask questions later' M.O.Sadhu Agashe's (Nana Patekar as Daya Naik) team goes about the business matter-of-factly, with tacit blessings of their masters, both political and police force. Sadhu has some scores to settle with an overseas don, who frequently phones in, tending his ops remotely and lending the cops grief. For reasons undisclosed, their rivalry continues unabated even after Sadhu's superior changes, a wanted gunman supposedly escapes from custody and Sadhu's own wife is killed in a revenge spree.Although a different film than the usual cop-criminal drama, it settles quickly into a dull, monotonous pace. Director Shimit Amin is unable to breathe life into the plot. Some of the textbook dialogs do not build up any intrigue. Even a five-year-old could figure out the climax as Sadhu holes up overseas to avenge his wife's murder.Nana Patekar's hard-hitting performance does salvage the movie to some extent. Daya Naik was well-known amongst crime-watchers both within and outside Mumbai, though the 'encounter business' has encountered serious opposition from politicians, civic activists and Human Rights groups, and has largely wound down.Just like instant baby cereal, this 'Instant Formula Flick' from RGV's factory spoon-feeds viewers using a patent format.

4.0,Movie to save the encounter specialist from MCOCA,"He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.Yes, this is from Nietzsche's Aphorism 146 from ""Beyond Good and Evil"". And that's what you find at the start of this movie.If you watch the whole movie, you will doubt if it was the message that the Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on. As the scenes crop up one by one, quite violent and at times puke-raking, the viewer is expected to forget the Nietzsche quote and think otherwise. That to deal with few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone, not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of the police to do, as we are made to believe).When TADA was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws, RGV's ""Satya"" did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like India. Within a year MCOCA was passed.When real life encounter specialist Daya Nayak 'became a monster on the path of fighting them' and was himself booked by MCOCA, ""Aab tak Chhappan"" was made to heed out ""false"" impression among the people about this. With it's ""you have to be a monster to save your nation"" approach.And people consumed it. No questions raised. Only praises and hopes that they get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over. Blood? You can ignore.Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like ""India must also similarly attack Pakistan"". This movie is made for such psychopaths.
