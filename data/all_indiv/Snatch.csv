9.0,There are few films that can make me laugh like this one can,"`Snatch', written and directed by Guy Ritchie is by far one of my favorite films of all time  it is easily in my personal Top Thirty. In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. Let's see if we can keep this straight:Turkish (Jason Statham) and his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are amateur boxing promoters who, after their premier fighter is wounded, have to find a replacement to fight, or one of the meanest guys in London, Brick Top (Alan Ford), who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them. Enter Mickey (Brad Pitt) the gypsy who knocked their fighter out, who is an unintelligible drunk with quite a right hook. Meanwhile, there is a diamond `the size of a fist' that has been stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). On his way back from London to America where he is planning on fencing the diamond, trouble ensues, and his fence, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is forced to come to London to find both Franky and the diamond with the help of characters like Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and Doug `The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid). Of course, this can't happen easily, as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film, Boris `The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija)  or as he's better known, `Boris the Bullet Dodger'. Did you get all that? The performances by all of the above actors, and several more that I didn't even mention are all really good, particularly Brad Pitt's. Every single actor in `Snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. This story, while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun. There are many one-liners that I still personally use four years after first seeing the film, and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just SO good. `Snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone, but Guy Ritchie's direction is so dead on, the film transcends brilliant and becomes FAN-insert your choice of expletive here-TASTIC. The slick cinematography, lightning-fast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story. Add on a great soundtrack that spans Oasis, techno and a traditional-sounding Hasidic song and Ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic. While this was not the first time I had seen the film `Snatch', it was the first time I'd watched the film knowing that I would have to analyze it slightly in order to funnel my thoughts from the film just being `Phenomenal!' to `Phenomenal because..' While I can certainly be classified as an unabashed Madonna fan, and have been for the last two decades, I REALLY hope that Ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the `Swept Away' path, rather, to get back to the work that has earned him well-deserved high praise.

8.0,"Lock, Stock, and Many Smoking Barrels","The release of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour. The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail. Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found. Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.Turkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers. Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel. Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit. Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet. The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit. If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad. While not a technically a sequel ""Snatch"" is stylistically very similar to ""Lock, Stock"": Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance. He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think ""Very Bad Things""). What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast. Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience? The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars. Somehow Ritchie manages - each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece. With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out: Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hitman. On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however, I would have to go with Brad PittPitt resurrects his trailer trash look from ""Kalifornia"" and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friend's Uncle Wally on a bad day. As Mickey O'Neil, the hard drinking wily grifter and part-time pugilist, Pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.While ""Snatch"" initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to Ritchie's earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own.",lock stock many smoking barrels,release tarantinos pulp fiction 1994 prompted schism staid gangster movie genre standard hallmarks serious characters gunfights intrigue damsels distress were enhanced with snappy dialogue gallows humour biggest change however was introduction mobius strip style plot line where concept time is no longer linear instead constantly folding upon itself flitting between past present future that forces viewer pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail inevitably numerous copycat films emerged that tried capitalize tarantinos success but it wasnt until 1998 when guy ritchie unknown british director took challenge that successor was found now ritchie is determined prove that his first time out wasnt fluke turkish is young man with entrepreneurial bent who when hes not running his gambling operation manages bareknuckle boxers through business deal gone wrong he becomes acquainted with one mickey oneil mumbling manic motor mouthed piker who also happens be one punch marvel turkish persuades mickey join his stable fighters but soon discovers that mickey has his own agenda gets turkish trouble with gangsters who run underground boxing circuit other characters that become involved drama include four fingered degenerate gambler jewel thief vicious boxing promoter gang inept robbers polite hitman crazed russian gun runner group irish gypsies crooked new york jeweler pugnacious pet common thread binding them all is perfect diamond size peach pit if you arent confused yet you soon will be lock stock two smoking barrels mr madonnas ritchie first film was shot small budget with no name cast except football bad boy vinnie jones quickly became rousing success at home found receptive audiences abroad while not technically sequel snatch is stylistically very similar lock stock ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences repeatedly bounces off radical tangents throw viewer off balance he did however opt decidedly darker satirical tone this film that may make some people uncomfortable think very bad things what struck me as particularly daring was his decision create story with such voluminous cast ritchie faced daunting task with this film how with roughly twenty principal characters does one adequately flesh out each character not hopelessly confuse audience feat was made doubly difficult as several cast members are big name stars somehow ritchie manages each actor is full bodied receives ample screen time no one character is centerpiece with so many talented actors it is difficult pick out one performance that stands out rade serbedzija is hilarious as mad russian who blithely burns through each his nine lives as is vinnie jones manic gentleman hitman other end spectrum is alan ford as brick top promoter with penchant pigs who epitomizes cold blooded viciousness if forced pick my favorite however i would have go with brad pittpitt resurrects his trailer trash look kalifornia adopts nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friends uncle wally bad day as mickey oneil hard drinking wily grifter part time pugilist pitt displays wide range emotions demonstrating again that he is not only star but also gifted character actor i would be remiss if i didnt mention dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared while snatch initially struggles find its stride is very similar ritchies earlier film it is fresh funny enough make you forget any minor shortfalls stand its own,0.49992317541613324,-0.002915066154502764,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.39}"
9.0,"Just as much fun as Lock, Stock. Snatch is a great and entertaining movie.","Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, ""SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND! WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!"" What do you think would happen? Snatch is what happens.Snatch is a confusing, twisting, crazy movie. Let me repeat that. This movie is crazy! Imagine the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid, and this is what you get my friend. Believe it or not, this mass confusion and complete insanity is very, very entertaining.The movie has it's problems. First off, for those of you who have seen Snatch's predecessor, (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you know that Guy Richie (the writer and director of both films) has a very music-video style as far as the camera angles, movements, and cinematography goes. The strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that I noticed people walking out of the theater. I was also turned off by this madness. However, most of this insane crap gets over within the first hour, so it doesn't last.If any of you people out there loved Lock Stock as much as I did, do yourself a favor and see this movie as fast as you can. Snatch is a bit more serious than Lock Stock, but when it's funny, you'll laugh till your lungs burst. It was nice to see Vinnie Jones, who was Big Chris in the last movie, return as the same basic character (only now named Bullet Tooth Tony) and doing the same ""slamming victim's head in a car door"" act again. The performances were just as great as Lock Stock, with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack. I was disappointed to see that Bendicio Del Toro didn't have a bigger role. I was expecting him to be a lead character, but he's not.So, in conclusion, if you have never seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie's style. I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction (unlike most people), but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp. That means if you liked Pulp, you will most likely like Snatch and Lock, Stock. If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock, you have deprived your life of culture.9/10",just as much fun as lock stock snatch is great entertaining movie,imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals various professions threw them into maze gave one criminals diamond size fist yelled out load someone this maze has huge diamond whoever finds it is last man standing wins what do you think would happen snatch is what happens snatch is confusing twisting crazy movie let me repeat that this movie is crazy imagine mr toads wild ride at disney word acid this is what you get my friend believe it or not this mass confusion complete insanity is very very entertaining movie has its problems first off those you who have seen snatchs predecessor lock stock two smoking barrels you know that guy richie writer director both films has very music video style as far as camera angles movements cinematography goes strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that i noticed people walking out theater i was also turned off by this madness however most this insane crap gets over within first hour so it doesnt last if any you people out there loved lock stock as much as i did do yourself favor see this movie as fast as you can snatch is bit more serious than lock stock but when its funny youll laugh till your lungs burst it was nice see vinnie jones who was big chris last movie return as same basic character only now named bullet tooth tony doing same slamming victims head car door act again performances were just as great as lock stock with jason statham pitt leading pack i was disappointed see that bendicio del toro didnt have bigger role i was expecting him be lead character but hes not so conclusion if you have never seen lock stock two smoking barrels i would see that first before seeing snatch so you can get adjusted guy richies style i still think that it is stupid compare either two movies pulp fiction unlike most people but it is same ballpark as pulp that means if you liked pulp you will most likely like snatch lock stock if you have never seen pulp or lock stock you have deprived your life culture 9 10,0.5399290780141844,0.08492907801418442,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,A Comedy Masterpiece,"""Snatch"" is fantastic; and not least because it demonstrates emphatically that the British movie industry is capable of rivaling even the best of what Hollywood can offer.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was one of the funniest movies released in recent years, and ""Snatch"" takes everything that ""Lock, Stock..."" did so well and does it even better.Back are the cleverly intertwined plotlines, the hilarious one-liners, and the simultaneously intimidating and comedic London villains. So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).Everyone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.Like Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.When it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better ""Snatch"".",comedy masterpiece,snatch is fantastic not least because it demonstrates emphatically that british movie industry is capable rivaling even best what hollywood can offer lock stock two smoking barrels was one funniest movies released recent years snatch takes everything that lock stock did so well does it even better back are cleverly intertwined plotlines hilarious one liners simultaneously intimidating comedic london villains so is skillful editing often original cinematographic style this time however it all looks somewhat slicker better funded alongside british regulars are odd american celebrity brad pitt benicio del toro everyone film puts excellent performance but pitt stands out as charismatic near incomprehensible gypsy boxer like ritchies earlier film this one takes little while find its feet but once it does pace doesnt slacken until finale one scene featuring three guys squeaking dog stolen car stands out particularly left audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered when it comes comedies i cannot recommend this one highly enough if youre after good laugh you wont find much better snatch,0.43012820512820515,0.2514423076923077,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Do You Know What Nemesis Means?,"I was never really too keen on ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"". All my friends constantly quoted it, raved and ranted, and then when ""Snatch"" came out, everyone made an even bigger deal of that. I watched Lock Stock, and though I did like it, it didn't really tickle my fancy. But Snatch, that's a completely different story all together.When I saw Snatch at the cinemas, I was shocked to see a couple leave only fifteen minutes into the film. As they left, you could hear their intellectually deficient comments; ""this movie is so boring"". I couldn't believe it! I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE, The Pope even!There are hundreds of thousands of reasons for anyone to see this movie; each word of the script being a reason.Snatch is possibly one of THE best written movies I've seen. It's smart, witty, funny and has just the right touches of dark humour. With characters like Turkish, Mickey, Tommy, Brick Top, Bullet Tooth Tony and Cousin Avi; their witty repartee will have your personal quotes list full for months after watching it. The camera work and editing complement each other to keep the film's pace on its toes, much like the boxers at the center of the character's stories.Jason Statham has some of THE best lines in the movie, constantly slamming anything even slightly intelligent his partner Tommy has to say. Brad Pitt turns out an excellent performance as the Irish-Gypsy-Pykie Mickey; his accent is hilarious. Even though the story line is only a simple one (following a massive Diamond through England's criminal underworld), it is the connections each character has to the diamond and each other that really makes this film stand out from all the usual jewel-heist films.Another 10 / 10 from me on this one, it's just a pity the follow up to Snatch was a ""collaborative effort"" from Mr. Richie and his um.......wife.",do you know what nemesis means,i was never really too keen lock stock two smoking barrels all my friends constantly quoted it raved ranted then when snatch came out everyone made even bigger deal that i watched lock stock though i did like it it didnt really tickle my fancy but snatch thats completely different story all together when i saw snatch at cinemas i was shocked see couple leave only fifteen minutes into film as they left you could hear their intellectually deficient comments this movie is so boring i couldnt believe it id recommend this movie anyone pope even there are hundreds thousands reasons anyone see this movie each word script being reason snatch is possibly one best written movies ive seen its smart witty funny has just right touches dark humour with characters like turkish mickey tommy brick top bullet tooth tony cousin avi their witty repartee will have your personal quotes list full months after watching it camera work editing complement each other keep films pace its toes much like boxers at center characters stories jason statham has some best lines movie constantly slamming anything even slightly intelligent his partner tommy has say brad pitt turns out excellent performance as irish gypsy pykie mickey his accent is hilarious even though story line is only simple one following massive diamond through englands criminal underworld it is connections each character has diamond each other that really makes this film stand out all usual jewel heist films another 10 10 me this one its just pity follow up snatch was collaborative effort mr richie his um wife,0.5333943833943835,0.10384615384615384,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Subtitles A Must To Really Enjoy This,"I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes. So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so?Well, because I usually enjoy ""stylish"" film-making and dark humor and this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets: fascinating visuals, odd camera angles and various tricks, sound effects, etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and most speak in a strong British accent. A gypsy, played by American Brad Pitt, is almost intelligible.This is why I strongly recommend you use English subtitles while watching this film, at least for the first viewing, or you will totally lost. The DVD offers a feature I've never seen before: the option of using subtitles solely for Pitt's character. The filmmakers knew few people were going to understand Pitt's weird way of speaking. Anyway, I recommend the subtitles for everyone. It makes the film more enjoyable when you know what's going on, especially with the many slang terms used in here that have to be totally foreign to most viewers outside GB.Since the action changes every two minutes to another scene with other people (Lord of The Rings subsequently did the same), it's had to get lulled to sleep or have your mind wander. Something wacky is going on every few minutes. The attitudes of the criminals are rough: these are low-life people in the underworld: extremely tough people with the toughest being ""Bricktop"" (Alan Ford) who likes to feed people to the pigs. There are a ton of f-words in here, too.The disjointed story is not easy to follow and I found I needed several viewings to understand everything that was going on. The characters are so strange, so cartoon-like, that - combined with the unique visuals - it makes it a fascinating film to watch every time. Some of these actors were fairly unknown at the time of this release , at least here in the States, such as Jason Statham (""The Transporter"") but we know them know. There is a good mix of young and old actors in here.This is a guy's movie with the top dozen actors in this film all tough-talking, almost-crude men (plus a funny dog). It's so weird, I'll just end with the cliché that ""this is not for all tastes"" but if you enjoy dark humor and something totally different, you might want to give it a shot.

,"I liked it, is that so wrong?","I am a 33 year old woman in a flowered dress who doesn't drink, rarely swears, sleeps with a teddy bear, and has never raised a hand to anyone in my life. But I liked this movie a lot, and according to someone who wrote a review earlier, that makes me personally responsible for the violence in America. I'm sorry - I never intended to hurt anyone.As for the movie - I usually get confused in fast-paced movies with so many characters, but when I watched Snatch I was able to keep all the characters straight pretty easily because each one had something unique and quirky about him. I liked that, and I liked the accents, and I liked the silly plot-twist humor, and I liked the dogs. The evil men were EVIL (""so evil you would call it the froo-its of the dev-eel"" to quote Mike Meyers). The bumbling men were endearing. The music was great. It was very violent (more so than Pulp Fiction, I think). Yet somehow it did not offend me and looking back at it I still laugh out loud.Oh, and I never saw ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", for whatever that's worth.",i liked it is that so wrong,i am 33 year old woman flowered dress who doesnt drink rarely swears sleeps with teddy bear has never raised hand anyone my life but i liked this movie lot according someone who wrote review earlier that makes me personally responsible violence america im sorry i never intended hurt anyone as movie i usually get confused fast paced movies with so many characters but when i watched snatch i was able keep all characters straight pretty easily because each one had something unique quirky about him i liked that i liked accents i liked silly plot twist humor i liked dogs evil men were evil so evil you would call it froo its dev eel quote mike meyers bumbling men were endearing music was great it was very violent more so than pulp fiction i think yet somehow it did not offend me looking back at it i still laugh out loud oh i never saw lock stock two smoking barrels whatever thats worth,0.6877450980392159,0.08848039215686272,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.46}"
,The way movies -should- be made.,"Read this review carefully, please.First off, Snatch is an amazing movie in every sense of the word. There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens onscreen without it having an effect on the plot.By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once.There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points (Think The Ring vs. Ringu, did we need the ""How long could you survive down there all alone?"" line?). Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully.The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming.

10.0,The pinnacle of Guy Ritchie's career,"This sleek, stylish and very effective black comedy-cum crime thriller is an excellent movie, and one of those rare 'perfect' films where it would be difficult to spot one flaw let alone a number. A follow-up to Guy Ritchie's powerhouse debut, LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, this sees the director in familiar territory with a haphazard plot involving a stolen diamond and an Irish gypsy boxer. It doesn't make much sense, there's no story, but what you do get are hundreds of twists and turns and confrontations, some absolutely hilarious scenes of comedy (anything with the dog in it is a classic) and tons of class acting and class actors.Jason Statham is great as the cool underdog; Alan Ford will scare the heck out of you as the supremely nasty Brick Top. Brad Pitt is welcome as the unintelligible Irish bare-knuckle boxer and his performance is spot-on, whilst Vinnie Jones makes a welcome return as gold-toothed bad guy Bullet Tooth Tony. Expect a host of cameos and walk-ons (Dennis Farina is particularly good, Benicio del Toro is particularly weird and spineless, Abe as Tyrone is hilarious), including small roles for our very own Goldie, Ewen Bremner, and Mike Reid, and you have a wonderfully wicked little film. SNATCH is packed with cool and punchy dialogue, originality, and a welcome freshness to the story, tons and tons of style, lots of violence and hilarious situations and much, much more.

,"Upping the ante on lock, stock...","I saw the first showing of Snatch in my town this past Friday. I loved it. I am quite a fan of Guy Ritchie's first and was expecting more of the same with Snatch. Rarely do a film's opening credits hype an audience as much as Snatch. Quick paced action-to-freeze-frame-cuts introduce each cast member in situations that identify their character sort. Then we're right in it. It's true, similarities abound between Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. From Vinnie Jones' character's tough as nails negotiating means, to oft referred to in-jokes between characters ('Zee Germans' here compared to 'Tubby Tommy' in LS&2SB). Still the film is fresh and not really a Lock, Stock take 2 of any sort. The humor is more frequent in this one and a major difference is how dark this film is compared to the previous. Alan Ford's Brick Top is the meanest SOB I can remember on film since Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs. Brad Pitt is a standout too as the never to be trusted One Punch Mickey-he's not as incomprehensible as the trailers make him out to be, but still that pikey accent is a huge laugh. And the scene where he is glaring at a burning trailer lumped my throat (when you find the context by which that scene is drawn it should get a reaction from anyone). The use of violence as humor is more embellished in Snatch as well (eg: the Bullet Tooth Tony and Boris the Blade showdown). Secondary characters are all over the movie and all grab laughs from their scenes , especially the dog and the tank of a getaway driver, Tyrone.See this movie for it's frenetic energy, retribution for the ""good guys"" is all that ties the end together but the ride to the finale is what makes this movie great. After all, as a wiser man than myself once said, it's not where you go, it's how you get there. Snatch is all about the ride.",upping ante lock stock,i saw first showing snatch my town this past friday i loved it i am quite fan guy ritchies first was expecting more same with snatch rarely do films opening credits hype audience as much as snatch quick paced action freeze frame cuts introduce each cast member situations that identify their character sort then were right it its true similarities abound between snatch lock stock two smoking barrels vinnie jones characters tough as nails negotiating means oft referred jokes between characters zee germans here compared tubby tommy ls 2sb still film is fresh not really lock stock take 2 any sort humor is more frequent this one major difference is how dark this film is compared previous alan fords brick top is meanest sob i can remember film since mr blonde reservoir dogs brad pitt is standout too as never be trusted one punch mickey hes not as incomprehensible as trailers make him out be but still that pikey accent is huge laugh scene where he is glaring at burning trailer lumped my throat when you find context by which that scene is drawn it should get reaction anyone use violence as humor is more embellished snatch as well eg bullet tooth tony boris blade showdown secondary characters are all over movie all grab laughs their scenes especially dog tank getaway driver tyrone see this movie its frenetic energy retribution good guys is all that ties end together but ride finale is what makes this movie great after all as wiser man than myself once said its not where you go its how you get there snatch is all about ride,0.45784072249589497,0.20951696770662287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,"For Every Action, There's A Pikey Reaction!","I saw Sherlock Holmes a couple of months ago and it was very good. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed that and my friends were raving about Guy Ritchie's style of film-making. So, now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works & rented out Snatch as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. I didn't want to know anything about this film beforehand as it takes away something from the experience and told my friends to shut up about the plot of Snatch. This was Jason Statham's second film, he was not so well known and Brad Pitt was already a superstar. This is one of the best films out there and I totally agree with IMDb users.So, this is the plot. Unscrupulous boxing promoters, violent bookmakers, a Russian gangster, incompetent amateur robbers, and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond.Turkish (Jason Statham) and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt) are obviously the first reason anyone would want to watch to the film. I cannot believe how awesome both Statham & Pitt were in this movie. Tommy is like Turkish's brother, they have known each other for a long time. Turkish is a boxing promoter. He entangles himself in Brick Top's hands, who is a bookmaker and Brick Top is a man you wouldn't want to end up owing him. Franky Four Fingers has a large diamond, 86 carats, which he stole and he is in league with cousin Avi. Boris The Blade wants the diamond. Everyone's a gangster or a goon, so this is a film which has nobody but thugs. Doug The Head is a dealer & if anyone knows about the diamond, he is the man. He has two twin daughters working as his assistants in his shop. Anyway, Tommy wants a caravan for himself and Turkish and goes to the pikeys to buy one. But, there he is scammed and Gorgeous George (Turkish's boxer in the unlicensed match in which Brick Top has invested a large amount of money) and Mickey fight it out in a bare knuckle match and Mickey wins, so George is out for a few months. Now, Turkish hires Mickey as the boxer for the match. The deal was that Mickey had to go down in the fourth round, but he wins in one shot, which doesn't go down too well with Brick Top. Sol and his bumbling amateur robbers get involved with the diamond, the damn dog is in all the scenes they are in which is very funny. Bullet Tooth Tony also wants the diamond. You know what? Trying to explain the plot line is ridiculous. All you need to know is, the story is set in London and most of the English spoken is in British accent.Mickey's mom is burned down along with the caravan by Brick Top because Mickey tried to get a new caravan for his mother from Turkish and had said he wouldn't fight till he got it. That was very touching, the expression on Brad Pitt's face made me so sad for his mother, I felt is anguish & anger. That was a defining moment in the film. Then the big finale match at the end of the film was just awesome. Tommy, Turkish, Mickey's life and the lives of the whole family and friends of Mickey are on the line on this match. Being the bastard Mickey is, he could not possibly go down in the fourth round at least this time, can he? Brad Pitt, Jason Statham & everybody give an engrossing performance. The film is pure brilliancy on the part of Guy Ritchie, the man has style ingrained on his bones, every scene is visually stylistic and the dialogues are superb, the background score is also really catchy. The way he has interwoven the lives of all these characters is brilliant. How else can you empathize with these characters who are all basically villains going against each other? One thing is for sure, you cannot predict one scene in the film, no matter how many movies you have watched.

9.0,Well edited and darkly funny,"This review contains spoilers.Snatch is a comedy movie that premiered in 2000. The movie is directed and written by Guy Ritchie. The movie stars an ensemble cast including Jason Statham, Stephen Graham, and Brad Pitt. A boxing promoter finds himself indebted to a ruthless gangster while a group of criminals search for a missing diamond.Snatch is a wildly funny movie. The humor derived from the movie is from the progressively ridiculous scenes that the movie creates. There are so many ridiculous scenes in this movie that make the movie memorable. Among these is Bullet-Dodger Avi, and his introduction, the drifter Mickey O'Neil played by Brad Pitt, and the ludicrous ways for the various characters to die. The movie blends all of these with stylish editing.The editing of this movie is by far one of the most electric parts of this movie. The editing and soundtrack keeps the movie at a fast pace as much of the movie depends on the energetic style of the editing. The characters in this movie are straightforward. They do not embark on a character arc. The characters interacting with one another is the appeal of this movie. From the start with every character's introduction, the audience knows what each of the characters wants. The movie is clear with each of the character's intent and nothing deviates from that.The characters are all distinct in this movie from their costumes to their mannerisms. Brad Pitt as Mickey O'Neill deserves mention for his impossible to decipher accent that made the audience and characters believe he is not speaking English. The rest of the characters all have distinct mannerisms. Even Jason Statham has a great intro as Turkish.I would recommend 'Snatch'.Grade: B",well edited darkly funny,this review contains spoilers snatch is comedy movie that premiered 2000 movie is directed written by guy ritchie movie stars ensemble cast including jason statham stephen graham brad pitt boxing promoter finds himself indebted ruthless gangster while group criminals search missing diamond snatch is wildly funny movie humor derived movie is progressively ridiculous scenes that movie creates there are so many ridiculous scenes this movie that make movie memorable among these is bullet dodger avi his introduction drifter mickey oneil played by brad pitt ludicrous ways various characters die movie blends all these with stylish editing editing this movie is by far one most electric parts this movie editing soundtrack keeps movie at fast pace as much movie depends energetic style editing characters this movie are straightforward they do not embark character arc characters interacting with one another is appeal this movie start with every characters introduction audience knows what each characters wants movie is clear with each characters intent nothing deviates that characters are all distinct this movie their costumes their mannerisms brad pitt as mickey oneill deserves mention his impossible decipher accent that made audience characters believe he is not speaking english rest characters all have distinct mannerisms even jason statham has great intro as turkish i would recommend snatch grade b,0.611231884057971,0.1322463768115942,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.55}"
,Style without substance,"A Diamond heist by Franky Four Fingers is carried out and he flies into London on a stop over. He goes to Boris The Blade for a gun and Boris tells him to go to the bookies for him and put money on a fight in exchange. Boris then sets Frankie up and has a group of men waiting to rob the bookies and Frankie. The fight in question is also difficult because promoters Turkish and Tommy have promised local villain Brick Top that they'll put up a fighter. Said fighter is put in hospital by a gypsy Tommy buys a caravan from (Mickey). Putting Mickey in the fight makes things worse when he not only refuses to take a dive but knocks the fighter out - to Bricktop's displeasure! Meanwhile Frankie's boss flies into London to find him and the jewel while Bricktop tries to catch the men who Boris sent to knock over his bookies.I had seen Lock, Stock and enjoyed it to a certain degree. It had problems but it was fresh and had energy and style. It re-launched the British gangster film with some good ones and some bad copies. One of those copies was Snatch - admittedly a copy by the same director! This film has all the style and energy of the Lock, Stock and borrows heavily from it. However it is clear that the plot is both weak and over-plotted (if that's possible!). It is weak because it is so full of cliché and silly occurrences and it is over-plotted in that every scene needs more plot in order to explain the new thing that just happened!What keeps it watchable is Ritchie's style and energy. The plot may not work but it moves along with pace that almost (almost) covers it's lack of substance. So we get the same old cockney gangsterisms, dark humour, Vinnie Jones being tough with a few good lines and so on. It felt to me like Ritchie just didn't have any other ideas in him. It's all very samey but his style saves it as he intercuts and delivers some really inventive shots. In tune with this style and energy is the casting. The film is much better cast that it deserves!Statham and Graham are the least colourful characters in the piece and Ritchie knows it - so despite being the leads, they often play second fiddle and only act as the catalyst. Ford, Reid, Jones et al all enjoy delivering tough old stereotypes and do well enough considering what they're there to do. Pitt is a great bit of casting - and here he is DELIBERATELY doing a bad Irish accent (unlike Devil's Own where it was an accident!). He is funny and seems to enjoy playing out of type. Likewise Del Toro and Farina can only help add class to the film.Overall though this is a victory for style over substance. It's visual style and general energy will carry it for the running time but when it was over I found it had failed to make any lasting impact on it and I really could remember very little of it - it had just seemed noisy and in a rush to get somewhere. Sure, I enjoyed it while it was on, but as little as 10 minutes afterwards I realised that I'd been taken for a ride by the style and flair of Ritchie. At time of writing it is 199 in the top 250 - you gotta be kidding me!",style without substance,diamond heist by franky four fingers is carried out he flies into london stop over he goes boris blade gun boris tells him go bookies him put money fight exchange boris then sets frankie up has group men waiting rob bookies frankie fight question is also difficult because promoters turkish tommy have promised local villain brick top that theyll put up fighter said fighter is put hospital by gypsy tommy buys caravan mickey putting mickey fight makes things worse when he not only refuses take dive but knocks fighter out bricktops displeasure meanwhile frankies boss flies into london find him jewel while bricktop tries catch men who boris sent knock over his bookies i had seen lock stock enjoyed it certain degree it had problems but it was fresh had energy style it re launched british gangster film with some good ones some bad copies one those copies was snatch admittedly copy by same director this film has all style energy lock stock borrows heavily it however it is clear that plot is both weak over plotted if thats possible it is weak because it is so full clich silly occurrences it is over plotted that every scene needs more plot order explain new thing that just happened what keeps it watchable is ritchies style energy plot may not work but it moves along with pace that almost almost covers its lack substance so we get same old cockney gangsterisms dark humour vinnie jones being tough with few good lines so it felt me like ritchie just didnt have any other ideas him its all very samey but his style saves it as he intercuts delivers some really inventive shots tune with this style energy is casting film is much better cast that it deserves statham graham are least colourful characters piece ritchie knows it so despite being leads they often play second fiddle only act as catalyst ford reid jones et al all enjoy delivering tough old stereotypes do well enough considering what theyre there do pitt is great bit casting here he is deliberately doing bad irish accent unlike devils own where it was accident he is funny seems enjoy playing out type likewise del toro farina can only help add class film overall though this is victory style over substance its visual style general energy will carry it running time but when it was over i found it had failed make any lasting impact it i really could remember very little it it had just seemed noisy rush get somewhere sure i enjoyed it while it was but as little as 10 minutes afterwards i realised that id been taken ride by style flair ritchie at time writing it is 199 top 250 you gotta be kidding me,0.5122490569858991,0.05730915040125567,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,My stomach hurts! It literally hurts!,"Last year I was working on the IMDb Top 250 list, and I noticed that Snatch was on the list, so I decided to take a look at it. I was in Denmark at that time. I live in Faroe Islands.I stayed at my uncle's apartment, and he told me that you have to watch some of Guy Ritchie's movies before watching Snatch to get to know his movies better, so I watched Revolver. I was not very keen on it and then I was not looking forward to see Snatch.While my uncle was not at home, I decided to watch it. I wanted to turn it off after the first second, because I thought it was so weird. I'm 14 years old now, and I knew almost nothing about cinema back then, and I had never seen such a movie like Snatch, and it's style! I thought it would be stupid of me to turn it off after 1 second so I kinda forced myself to watch it. To be honest, I actually loved the weird style after 10 minutes!The cinematography was great. I had never seen something like that before and the editing was just as great too. There were lots of great characters and the script was excellent. It was funny and clever and it will you make you laugh every single second! This movie is like Pulp Fiction. You can almost quote every line! The acting was totally awesome! Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and the rest were great, but Brad Pitt totally stole the show!I was thinking to myself ""This movie can't be any better!"", but then it got better! Brad Pitt showed up! His accent got me laughing all the time! My stomach hurt, it literally hurt, and I got many bruises on my thighs because I could not stop hitting myself from laughing!This was one of the few movies that I didn't want to end, so I decided to watch it again the next day and the next day after that.I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but there are few movies that are better than this one!

""Snatch."" has a rather convoluted plot, but the pace makes it worthwhile. Focusing on several groups of criminals trying to capture a diamond, it's basically a series of crazy situations. The weirdest (by which I mean ""coolest"") aspect is of course Brad Pitt's incomprehensible accent. But the other characters also have their own things to reveal about themselves.All in all, a great movie with lots of fun.

9.0,"Good, but it's not a film for most folks....","My summary sounds a bit vague, so let me explain. ""Snatch."" is a very, very, very bloody and violent film. It also has a lot of very rough language and a bit of nudity. So, it's obviously not a film you show your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins!! This isn't as much a complaint as an observation--one you really should heed before you try watching the film. I just can't see most folks gravitating to a movie like this one, though if you do, it IS incredibly unique and well made.This film begins with a jewel robbery in which a nearly baseball-sized diamond is stolen. While this might seem like a great thing for the thieves, it sets of a LONG series of violent events as practically every gang in the UK seems willing to kill to get it. Most of these gangs are insanely dangerous, while some are comically stupid and a few are really hard to size up. Repeatedly, folks are killed and repeatedly the diamond changes hands. Who, ultimately, will get the diamond and who will survive? You'll have no idea up until the final crazy ending.""Snatch."" is an incredibly stylish film--quite artistic in the way it is pieced together. It is even more stylish than Tarantino's ""Kill: Bill"" movies. And, the plot is amusing (while it isn't nauseating or scaring the life out of you). A thoroughly unpredictable and ROUGH film. If it's the sort of thing you like, you'll love it. As for me, I rate the film highly but it really isn't the sort of thing I like because of its excesses and I felt a bit uneasy laughing through the carnage (and, oddly, the film is quite funny). Worth seeing for the right crowd.",good but its not film most folks,my summary sounds bit vague so let me explain snatch is very very very bloody violent film it also has lot very rough language bit nudity so its obviously not film you show your kids your mother law or father jenkins this isnt as much complaint as observation one you really should heed before you try watching film i just cant see most folks gravitating movie like this one though if you do it is incredibly unique well made this film begins with jewel robbery which nearly baseball sized diamond is stolen while this might seem like great thing thieves it sets long series violent events as practically every gang uk seems willing kill get it most these gangs are insanely dangerous while some are comically stupid few are really hard size up repeatedly folks are killed repeatedly diamond changes hands who ultimately will get diamond who will survive youll have no idea up until final crazy ending snatch is incredibly stylish film quite artistic way it is pieced together it is even more stylish than tarantinos kill bill movies plot is amusing while it isnt nauseating or scaring life out you thoroughly unpredictable rough film if its sort thing you like youll love it as me i rate film highly but it really isnt sort thing i like because its excesses i felt bit uneasy laughing through carnage oddly film is quite funny worth seeing right crowd,0.6381379731379732,0.03459096459096459,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,"Brutally funny, a stylish masterpiece","The tightly knit formula for the average ""heist movie"", is constantly in danger of becoming predictable to the point of redundancy with each new increasingly formulaic entry, so to see a film quietly whisk in and reinvigorate the genre was a refreshing feat indeed. And if anyone was up for the task, it was visionary director Guy Ritchie, sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to deliver his most hard hitting, savagely funny and effortlessly stylish film to date - Snatch. Director Ritchie has somewhat fallen out of favour with both critics and audiences of late with both his ill-advised cinematic tribute to his wife Madonna, Swept Away, and his nonsensical gambling drama Revolver, so it is easy to forget how masterful a filmmaker he can truly be when given the chance. Ritchie's convoluted tale, which ties together three parallel stories involving a diamond theft and the world of unlicensed bare knuckle boxing in the British underground may prove to be too full of twists and turns to be followed entirely on the first viewing. This, along with the stylistic similarities to its predecessor may prove to be the film's only major criticism; however, it is highly unlikely the majority of audiences will feel alienated by the fact that the adrenaline fuelled plot may prove hard to follow, and instead relish the chance to revisit the film multiple times to pick up on things they may have missed in previous viewings. In a film with as much to appreciate as this, it comes as no surprise that multiple viewings never seem to detract from the experience, but that the film seems only to increase in quality upon each viewing. Stylistically, the film is in a class of its own, employing hyper-kinetic cinematography and editing, which proves to be some of the most vivid and inventive work demonstrated in recent cinematic history. The film's score and musical selection is consistently pitch perfect, and endlessly catchy, never failing to amplify the seedy yet comical mood. Ritchie's sense of pacing is impeccable, and how a film which opens with a group of Jewish rabbis entering a bank, (which in itself sounds like the beginning to a particularly brilliant joke) only to steal its valuable contents, launching the film into an adrenaline fuelled title sequence could ever be considered not funny or at the very least oozing with style is beyond conventional logic. Ritchie also proves to have a real eye for location, and in each scene the viewer feels fully immersed in the grunge and filth of the underground, making the film that much more effective. The ensemble cast rise to the challenge of bringing Ritchie's brilliant screenplay to life, and turn out universally superb performances, each creating a unique and memorable character, complete with catchy names. Jason Statham is consistently strong as boxing promoter Turkish; his deadpan delivery and excellent narration carry the film wonderfully. Steven Graham similarly raises many a laugh as his consistently dumbfounded sidekick, Tommy. Benicio Del Toro makes wonderful use of his far too brief screen time as gambling addicted diamond thief Franky Four Fingers - his Las Vegas gambling flashbacks are nothing less than flat out hilarious. Ritchie favourite Vinnie Jones is savagely hilarious as mercenary Bullet Tooth Tony (a role it would seem is only a step away from his real life persona) and Russian actor Rade Serbedzija creates a simply classic character as arms dealer 'Boris the Blade'. Character actor Alan Ford makes for an exquisitely menacing antagonist as gambling shark 'Brick Top', and Robbie Gee and Lennie James are consistently hilarious as thoroughly unlucky attempted jewellery thieves. But surprisingly enough, the film's unlikely standout proves without a question to be its biggest star: Brad Pitt, waltzing in to steal the show as incomprehensible 'Pikey' boxer Mickey - an egoless and thoroughly hilarious performance. Though this may be familiar ground for those who have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Guy Ritchie's Snatch is no less enjoyable as a result - brutally violent, caustic and hilarious, with Ritchie's trademark sense of incomparable style. Snatch excels in every possible aspect, and the truly talented cast bring their vibrant characters to life with unquestionable flair, each one flat out hilarious when given their moment to shine. Though all of the film's intricacies may not be entirely clear on the first viewing, this only makes each following viewing all the more intriguing and entertaining. For those who have yet to appreciate the cinematic genius that is Snatch... don't wait for protection from ""Zee Germans"", simply see it!-10/10",brutally funny stylish masterpiece,tightly knit formula average heist movie is constantly danger becoming predictable point redundancy with each new increasingly formulaic entry so see film quietly whisk reinvigorate genre was refreshing feat indeed if anyone was up task it was visionary director guy ritchie sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic lock stock two smoking barrels deliver his most hard hitting savagely funny effortlessly stylish film date snatch director ritchie has somewhat fallen out favour with both critics audiences late with both his ill advised cinematic tribute his wife madonna swept away his nonsensical gambling drama revolver so it is easy forget how masterful filmmaker he can truly be when given chance ritchies convoluted tale which ties together three parallel stories involving diamond theft world unlicensed bare knuckle boxing british underground may prove be too full twists turns be followed entirely first viewing this along with stylistic similarities its predecessor may prove be films only major criticism however it is highly unlikely majority audiences will feel alienated by fact that adrenaline fuelled plot may prove hard follow instead relish chance revisit film multiple times pick up things they may have missed previous viewings film with as much appreciate as this it comes as no surprise that multiple viewings never seem detract experience but that film seems only increase quality upon each viewing stylistically film is class its own employing hyper kinetic cinematography editing which proves be some most vivid inventive work demonstrated recent cinematic history films score musical selection is consistently pitch perfect endlessly catchy never failing amplify seedy yet comical mood ritchies sense pacing is impeccable how film which opens with group jewish rabbis entering bank which itself sounds like beginning particularly brilliant joke only steal its valuable contents launching film into adrenaline fuelled title sequence could ever be considered not funny or at very least oozing with style is beyond conventional logic ritchie also proves have real eye location each scene viewer feels fully immersed grunge filth underground making film that much more effective ensemble cast rise challenge bringing ritchies brilliant screenplay life turn out universally superb performances each creating unique memorable character complete with catchy names jason statham is consistently strong as boxing promoter turkish his deadpan delivery excellent narration carry film wonderfully steven graham similarly raises many laugh as his consistently dumbfounded sidekick tommy benicio del toro makes wonderful use his far too brief screen time as gambling addicted diamond thief franky four fingers his las vegas gambling flashbacks are nothing less than flat out hilarious ritchie favourite vinnie jones is savagely hilarious as mercenary bullet tooth tony role it would seem is only step away his real life persona russian actor rade serbedzija creates simply classic character as arms dealer boris blade character actor alan ford makes exquisitely menacing antagonist as gambling shark brick top robbie gee lennie james are consistently hilarious as thoroughly unlucky attempted jewellery thieves but surprisingly enough films unlikely standout proves without question be its biggest star brad pitt waltzing steal show as incomprehensible pikey boxer mickey egoless thoroughly hilarious performance though this may be familiar ground those who have seen lock stock two smoking barrels guy ritchies snatch is no less enjoyable as result brutally violent caustic hilarious with ritchies trademark sense incomparable style snatch excels every possible aspect truly talented cast bring their vibrant characters life with unquestionable flair each one flat out hilarious when given their moment shine though all films intricacies may not be entirely clear first viewing this only makes each following viewing all more intriguing entertaining those who have yet appreciate cinematic genius that is snatch dont wait protection zee germans simply see it 10 10,0.565546536796537,0.18924793212739646,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,Might be my Favorite Movie,So I just saw Snatch and it might be my favorite movie I've ever seen. It is filled with so much fun and funny moments that it made the film so enjoyable to the point where it made me want to write a full review for it. All the cast is great and play their roles really well. The film's comedy is probably the best part about this film. My stomach hurt from laughter because of how funny this film is.

8.0,In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?,"Snatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it's loved by the target audience. Guy Ritchie has done a Sam Raimi, he has remade the first film that put him on the cinematic map. Where Raimi remade The Evil Dead, and just called it Evil Dead II, Ritchie cheekily tries to get away with remaking Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and calling it Snatch. Sure the circumstances in plotting are different, and there's a big American star brought in to beef things up for the global market, but it's the same movie and without doubt it's lazy film making. But it still - like Evil Dead II - Rocks!Snatch in story terms is concerned with a big diamond that stitches together a number of threads involving the London underworld. Some rough and tough Romany types join in the fun, headed by a purposely illegible Brad Pitt, while Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro and Rade Serbedzija add more cosmopolitan meat to the crooks and gangster stew. The British cement holding the building up comes in the twin forms of Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, with Vinnie Jones once again turning up to frighten the masses. Everything from bare knuckle fighting to bumbled robberies - to dog fighting and shifty arcade empires - are here, with Ritchie writing characterisations that positively boom off of the screen. As with ""Lock-Stock"", the beauty is in the way violence and humour are deftly blended. Scenes are often bloody but also bloody funny, a pearl of dialogue is never far away from a perilous situation. The comic tone is more close to the knuckle here, Ritchie having fun toying with ethnic and machismo stereotypes, while he brings his bag of visual tricks before it got boring. The narrative is deliciously complex, but much credit to Ritchie for the way he pulls all the threads neatly together in a whirl of scene splicing and cocky literary assuredness.So it's ""Lock-Stock 2"" then! No bad thing if you happen to be a fan of that sort of wide boy malarkey. If you don't like it? Then jog on sunshine. 8/10",quiet words virgin mary come again,snatch seems be one those spunky british gangster films that critics are divided yet its loved by target audience guy ritchie has done sam raimi he has remade first film that put him cinematic map where raimi remade evil dead just called it evil dead ii ritchie cheekily tries get away with remaking lock stock two smoking barrels calling it snatch sure circumstances plotting are different theres big american star brought beef things up global market but its same movie without doubt its lazy film making but it still like evil dead ii rocks snatch story terms is concerned with big diamond that stitches together number threads involving london underworld some rough tough romany types join fun headed by purposely illegible brad pitt while dennis farina benicio del toro rade serbedzija add more cosmopolitan meat crooks gangster stew british cement holding building up comes twin forms jason statham stephen graham with vinnie jones once again turning up frighten masses everything bare knuckle fighting bumbled robberies dog fighting shifty arcade empires are here with ritchie writing characterisations that positively boom off screen as with lock stock beauty is way violence humour are deftly blended scenes are often bloody but also bloody funny pearl dialogue is never far away perilous situation comic tone is more close knuckle here ritchie having fun toying with ethnic machismo stereotypes while he brings his bag visual tricks before it got boring narrative is deliciously complex but much credit ritchie way he pulls all threads neatly together whirl scene splicing cocky literary assuredness so its lock stock 2 then no bad thing if you happen be fan that sort wide boy malarkey if you dont like it then jog sunshine 8 10,0.4846820477502295,-0.05935491276400367,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8.0,But I like style over substance. Who took the jam out of your donut?,"(r#93)Whine, whine, whine, is that all you people know how to do? I mean, sorry to burst your bubble, but Snatch is not the kind of film you give an in-depth analysis. Snatch is a roller-coaster ride that you just sit back and enjoy. It is a brilliantly funny movie, with an unimportant story which still takes a couple of viewings to fully absorb. Add to that a fantastic cast, including Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, the dog, and Alan Ford as the sweet-natured Brick Top. Add to *that* that Guy Ritchie's fantastic way of using his camera and music to give the fantastic flair that is the trademark of his ""lorry-gangsta"" films. What more could you want?Everyone's raving about Brad Pitt's performance as the incomprehensible Mickey, and yes, he's great. But Rabe Serbedzija doesn't get nearly enough attention as Boris the Blade! This guy is pure comic genius. Watch the scene where he's selling a gun to Turkish's partner Tommy. A fantastic actor all around. But what am I talking about? Literally every single actor is hilarious in this film. Benicio Del Toro is a complete psycho, Jason Statham keeps burning his buddy Tommy, Alan Ford is brutal (in more than one way) as the crime boss who feeds people to the pigs. The rather unknown Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade all hit the right notes as three slightly-less-than-competent street thugs.Do I even need to say that the script is utterly brilliant? Who can forget these lines?? ""I shoot you! You go down!""; ""It was two minutes five minutes ago!""; ""What? You don't think I've got the vitamins?""; ""Do you know what 'nemesis' means?""; ""It was *behind* you, Tyrone. When you reverse, things tend to come up from behind you!""; ""Tommy, 'the tit', is praying. And if he isn't, he f-ing should be.""; ""Don't snatch!""; ""I love this song!""; ""Anything to declare?"" ""Yeah. Don't go to England.""; the list goes on and on.Overall a hilarious, forgettable, but instantly quotable flick to just turn on and enjoy the hell out of whenever you're bored. And what's wrong with that? Do you really want every film to change your life? Snatch is entertainment at its finest, and if you have to whine about 1-dimensional characters, bad storyline, or style over substance, start a blog. At least then we won't have to read it.PS.
