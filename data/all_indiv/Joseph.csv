8.0,Emotionally appealing,"Movie opens with a medal awarding ceremony at a police parade. Then there is the falshback portraying the protagonist's life. Joseph, played by Joju George, is a retired police officer leading a life of solitude. He is an alcoholic and a chain smoker, yet he is a living image of ' Sherlock Holmes' due to his impeccable ability to understand and solve crimes. Due to that he is often an unofficial part of most difficult cases post his retirement. The first half of the movie largely revolves around the tragic life of the protagonist and the evolution of his character. Joju George shines throughout the movie with his exceptional acting ability, especially during emotional scenes. He makes us forget that he is actually the Joju George who played all those witty comic roles. Kudos to him. That said the supporting characters were also brilliant. The director makes the tragic life of the protagonist more appealing by adding an element of melodramatic music every once in a while which actually compliments the context of the film. The second half of the movie deals with the death of Joseph's ex-wife and him investigating the death. The crime investigation in the second part isn't anything overwhelmingly brilliant. It relies on an implausible coincidence. Yet the story manages to convey some socially relevant message to the audience. But personally I thought the second half of the movie was a little down as compared to the first half. Everything said the movie was a great experience. The cinematography was out of the world. The music was good. Also we get to see how capable an actor Joju George is. Being a largely male centered film, the portrayal of female characters were a little weak but that doesn't affect the movie in any way. The movie is really worth a watch. Hope it does well at the box office.",emotionally appealing,movie opens with medal awarding ceremony at police parade then there is falshback portraying protagonists life joseph played by joju george is retired police officer leading life solitude he is alcoholic chain smoker yet he is living image sherlock holmes due his impeccable ability understand solve crimes due that he is often unofficial part most difficult cases post his retirement first half movie largely revolves around tragic life protagonist evolution his character joju george shines throughout movie with his exceptional acting ability especially during emotional scenes he makes us forget that he is actually joju george who played all those witty comic roles kudos him that said supporting characters were also brilliant director makes tragic life protagonist more appealing by adding element melodramatic music every once while which actually compliments context film second half movie deals with death josephs ex wife him investigating death crime investigation second part isnt anything overwhelmingly brilliant it relies implausible coincidence yet story manages convey some socially relevant message audience but personally i thought second half movie was little down as compared first half everything said movie was great experience cinematography was out world music was good also we get see how capable actor joju george is being largely male centered film portrayal female characters were little weak but that doesnt affect movie any way movie is really worth watch hope it does well at box office,0.45168430335097004,0.11130511463844799,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,An 'observe' thriller,"Joseph was wonderfully wrote, directed and presented. This is the simplest form that I am able to express my views about this movie. Malayalam films are stood apart from thrilling plots and it's just minute numbers of films had that quality somehow through Drishyam, Abrahaminte Snathathikal etc. but this one was really just fine in portraying a trilling subject undo a public relevant depiction.

8.0,Why is it always Malayalam Cinema coming up with some sensational revelation? Joseph is another UNMISSABLE THRILLER!,"Joseph (2018) : Brief Review -Why is it always Malayalam Cinema coming up with some sensational revelation? Joseph is another UNMISSABLE THRILLER! I have been going through some major Malayalam classics recently and i have found many of them really great. But the sad truth is, those films come from small industry so don't get enough recognition on pan India level hence, the IMDb Rating or Social Media popularity is far less than what it deserves. Because of these classics, some really good classics from other industries have started looking overrated. Anyways, Joseph is another less popular film compared to other overhyped thrillers of South and it easily beats 90% of those Top Rated IMDb Movies from all industries of South. The story develops through the life of four retired policemen. It has the tone of a thriller investigation. An issue affecting the life of Joseph, the central character, and his family is being investigated. I am not gonna reveal anything about the story because i want you to watch the film with blank mind. There is something different and important at the end which might shock you and it is related to our lives. So, it's not just a film for fictional entertainment but it is also important to the society. How and why, you find out yourself after watching it. Just don't miss it for your own sake. Joju George as Joseph is superb. Not a single scene where he looked out of the character. There are variations, there's is compatibility and there's stone-like attitude. Not just him but other cast members are very good in their roles, too. The screenplay is little slow in the middle but overall it's enough engaging. Cinematography is quite good and dialogues are fairly decent. The film is more about sensational revelations and the plotting around it than regular thriller aspects so one has to look at it from that perspective. A salute to M. Padmakumar for daring to make such a film with great cinematic sense.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",why is it always malayalam cinema coming up with some sensational revelation joseph is another unmissable thriller,joseph 2018 brief review why is it always malayalam cinema coming up with some sensational revelation joseph is another unmissable thriller i have been going through some major malayalam classics recently i have found many them really great but sad truth is those films come small industry so dont get enough recognition pan india level hence imdb rating or social media popularity is far less than what it deserves because these classics some really good classics other industries have started looking overrated anyways joseph is another less popular film compared other overhyped thrillers south it easily beats 90 those top rated imdb movies all industries south story develops through life four retired policemen it has tone thriller investigation issue affecting life joseph central character his family is being investigated i am not gonna reveal anything about story because i want you watch film with blank mind there is something different important at end which might shock you it is related our lives so its not just film fictional entertainment but it is also important society how why you find out yourself after watching it just dont miss it your own sake joju george as joseph is superb not single scene where he looked out character there are variations theres is compatibility theres stone like attitude not just him but other cast members are very good their roles too screenplay is little slow middle but overall its enough engaging cinematography is quite good dialogues are fairly decent film is more about sensational revelations plotting around it than regular thriller aspects so one has look at it that perspective salute m padmakumar daring make such film with great cinematic sense rating 8 10 by,0.5060770027074375,0.21077639751552796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.25}"

There is good quality intrigue to Joseph and his ways, but there are a couple of story segments that did not gel in well enough, while there were others that felt perfect. Towards the end of the movie, it gets slightly preachy.Music is by a new comer Ranjin Raj and some of the vocals in the songs felt slightly imperfect which made them more attractive as they blended in better into the movie thus. Nice songs.The actress who has played Joseph's wife is a new comer as well and she fit the role perfectly. Casting has been done pretty well, in general.Camera work was done in a simple manner, in line with the story telling manner. No spectacular vistas etc. That was all good. Again, towards the end, there was some camera work that felt pretty amateurish -scenes artificially cutting out Nedumuni Venu's head out while his voice is heard.The movie belongs to Jojo!

9.0,"Noirish,slow burning,brilliant..At par with any Jean Pierre Melville thrillers of the yore.","A couple of weeks ago I was put through two and hours of gutter crap called 'Ratsasan' from my neighboring state of Tami Nadu.Watching Joseph after Ratsasan was like getting cleansed from something evil that was sticking to me for the last two decades.Director Padmakumar is a veteran of sorts in Malayalam movie industry.As an ardent movie lover my personal take on this director is,he was just average.He could never rise above a script, an ordinary script remained ordinary ,he could never make it special with the so called ' treatment' which we often associate to masters like Padmarajan.So more than the director I want to credit the writer Shahi Kabir, never heard of him before, for the success of Joseph. Joseph,the titular character played to perfection by Joju K George is a retired low ranking cop still highly respected by his seniors as well as new entrants for his natural instincts in solving complicated crimes.He lives alone drinking , abandoned and wasted.He was once a happily married family man.The reason for his wife,Stella, leaving him has an emotional backdrop which forms the Crux of the story which I don't want to spoil.He finds solace in his 4 friends from the force with whom he travels and drinks. One day Joseph gets the news of Stella,now married to another man, being a victim of a hit and run incident.Joseph is devastated.She soon succumbs to her injuries.The hospital authorities pressures her new husband to donate her organs on humanitarian grounds to which he agrees.Later a chance visit to a police station where Stella's mauled scooter which she was riding when she was hit is lying neglected.Joseph finds something odd in the whole incident and he decides to investigate on his own.What Joesph unravels is a web of deceit and greed that has no regard for human life and ultimately ends in a heart-rending sacrifice. A man who deserves standing ovation in this particular work is Anil Johnson who scored the back ground ( not songs).Like the earlier mentioned Ratsasan he could've ripped apart the viewers brain and hearing system with all the tools he had in his kitty.Here,Mr.Anil heightens tension,generates panic, sometimes pours love and affection..by using one simple Technic, being mellifluous.This track deserves a release.Outstanding.For a thriller this movie has a surprising number of songs and young Ranjin Raj has come up with songs that have retained long lost Malayalam sensibilities..often reminding vintage Ilayaraja.Manesh Madhavans camera is crisp and bright and never brooding contrary to the mood of the cinema. The movie is populated by Malayalam industries powerhouse performers.All of them are ordinanary looking and tailored for the part they played.The director deserves a pat for casting and the effectively executed accident scene near the climax.
