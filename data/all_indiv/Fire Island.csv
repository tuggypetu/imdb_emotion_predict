8.0,Andrew Ahn and Joel Kim Booster deliver a solid adaptation of Austen's Pride and Prejudice with a gay twist,"A group of cash strapped gay friends consisting of Noah (Joel Kim Booster), Howie (Bowen Yang), Luke (Matt Rogers), Keegan (Tomas Matos), and Max (Torian Miller) embark on their annual weeklong vacation to Fire Island to stay with their friend Erin (Margaret Cho) who has a house on the island. Noah despite often engaging in hedonistic sex and partying the year's prior decides to put this on hold until he helps Howie find a man for himself. The group eventually come into contact with wealthy gay men Charlie (James Scully) who seemingly hits it off with Howie, and Charlie's friend Will (Conrad Ricamora) whose demeanor initially gets under Noah's skin but overtime a romance develops despite their class disparity.Fire Island is the latest film from director Andrew Ahn who's become something of an indie darling in recent years with prvious films such Spa Night and Driveways garnering Ahn critical acclaim. Written by comedian Joel Kim Booster, the gay themed take on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was initially intended as a project for the now defunct Quibi streaming service (which is the subject of a joke in film) under director Stephen Dunn of Closet Monster before the series was cancelled along with several other in development or filming Quibi shows. Searchlight Pictures purchased the script roughly 6 months after Quibi shutdown and repurposed the concept as a feature film and Ahn replacing Dunn in the director's chair. Now the movie makes its way to Hulu and Ahn shows himself to be just as steady helming a studio release as either of his indie projects.Joel Kim Booster does an excellent job serving as writer and star of Fire Island as he takes the basic framework of Austen's story while incorporating various aspects of the real life Fire Island and gay culture into the story to give this classic story of classism and romance a modern day LGBTQ twist. The movie mines a lot of sharp humor from its usage of Fire Island serving as a microcosm of a class divide between upper class gay people and those of lower means and it sticks pretty true to the Austen work. The movie's ensemble does quite well with the relationships between Hoan, Howie, and the others very endearing, and Margaret Cho is lovable as Eri who by her words serves as the ""mom"" in their surrogate family. Fire Island is quite a sweet movie when it comes to its characters and it helps that not only are they interesting and funny, but there's a strong sense of familial love among the sequences of romance and hedonistic sexuality that keeps the viewer engaged.Fire Island continues Ahn's solid work in the director's chair and serves as an excellent showcase for Joel Kim Booster as a leading man and a screenwriter. If you're familial with the Jane Austen story Pride and Prejudice you'll have a lot of fun noting the parallels in the story and how well they've been adapted and even if you're not the movie still works on its own terms.",andrew ahn joel kim booster deliver solid adaptation austens pride prejudice with gay twist,group cash strapped gay friends consisting noah joel kim booster howie bowen yang luke matt rogers keegan tomas matos max torian miller embark their annual weeklong vacation fire island stay with their friend erin margaret cho who has house island noah despite often engaging hedonistic sex partying years prior decides put this hold until he helps howie find man himself group eventually come into contact with wealthy gay men charlie james scully who seemingly hits it off with howie charlies friend will conrad ricamora whose demeanor initially gets under noahs skin but overtime romance develops despite their class disparity fire island is latest film director andrew ahn whos become something indie darling recent years with prvious films such spa night driveways garnering ahn critical acclaim written by comedian joel kim booster gay themed take jane austens pride prejudice was initially intended as project now defunct quibi streaming service which is subject joke film under director stephen dunn closet monster before series was cancelled along with several other development or filming quibi shows searchlight pictures purchased script roughly 6 months after quibi shutdown repurposed concept as feature film ahn replacing dunn directors chair now movie makes its way hulu ahn shows himself be just as steady helming studio release as either his indie projects joel kim booster does excellent job serving as writer star fire island as he takes basic framework austens story while incorporating various aspects real life fire island gay culture into story give this classic story classism romance modern day lgbtq twist movie mines lot sharp humor its usage fire island serving as microcosm class divide between upper class gay people those lower means it sticks pretty true austen work movies ensemble does quite well with relationships between hoan howie others very endearing margaret cho is lovable as eri who by her words serves as mom their surrogate family fire island is quite sweet movie when it comes its characters it helps that not only are they interesting funny but theres strong sense familial love among sequences romance hedonistic sexuality that keeps viewer engaged fire island continues ahns solid work directors chair serves as excellent showcase joel kim booster as leading man screenwriter if youre familial with jane austen story pride prejudice youll have lot fun noting parallels story how well theyve been adapted even if youre not movie still works its own terms,0.49074074074074087,0.24000000000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.29}"

4.0,Misfire Island,"Gay culture has gone from being avant-garde, creative , groundbreaking and just inspiring to...this.Fire Island is a vague retelling of a story we know by heart but set in a world of vacuous unlikable characters. I'm all for satire and comedy but this movie doesn't embrace its potential at all. Every single gay cliché is presented in the most tired way: the Abercrombie gays, the druggy hysterical party gays only good at prep jokes and embarrassing themselves by vomiting, the archaic trope of poor gay= fun and loving / rich gay= boring and obnoxious. The Onlyfans reference was of course associated with a negative character. Ironically this movie is full of judgmental preconceived ideas about gays standards : shy nerd / alpha male, New York / rest of the US, and the cast is still a bunch of fairly fit short hair male meeting other fit short hair men, one may have a moustache. There are deers but there are also Bears on Fire Island just sayingThe first half is basically a (bad) straight comedy with gay people in it, the second half is practically a Lifetime movie. Nothing is original or feels sincere. I mean any episode of Modern Family was edgier and funnier in its gay representation than this and that was a prime time TV sitcom. Caricature can be very funny it just has to feel fresh.On the positive, the actors do their best with the script and give gravitas to the predictable sentimental talks. I really hope to see Bowen Yang is something better.",misfire island,gay culture has gone being avant garde creative groundbreaking just inspiring this fire island is vague retelling story we know by heart but set world vacuous unlikable characters im all satire comedy but this movie doesnt embrace its potential at all every single gay clich is presented most tired way abercrombie gays druggy hysterical party gays only good at prep jokes embarrassing themselves by vomiting archaic trope poor gay fun loving rich gay boring obnoxious onlyfans reference was course associated with negative character ironically this movie is full judgmental preconceived ideas about gays standards shy nerd alpha male new york rest us cast is still bunch fairly fit short hair male meeting other fit short hair men one may have moustache there are deers but there are also bears fire island just sayingthe first half is basically bad straight comedy with gay people it second half is practically lifetime movie nothing is original or feels sincere i mean any episode modern family was edgier funnier its gay representation than this that was prime time tv sitcom caricature can be very funny it just has feel fresh positive actors do their best with script give gravitas predictable sentimental talks i really hope see bowen yang is something better,0.5315709617180207,0.09894851880145997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.32}"

The characters where so unlikeable I hated every one in the film.

Even the characters or stereotypes oh the hot gay one is the one who turns out to be the jerk but the rest are not. It just drive me nuts. Margaret Cho is the only good thing about this show.

4.0,Hateful characters,"This is a movie that has a plot that can be resolved with a conversation.The main conflict can be resolved very easily, but because the characters are toxic and there is no communication between them we have this movie. It is difficult to define the genre of this film, first it seems like a comedy, then a dramatic comedy and at the last a romantic comedy, because of this it was difficult for me to connect with the story, even though it has some good things. The characters are very annoying, since their stubbornness is unbearable and creates many conflicts in the story, the ending does not have much to do with what they were telling us almost the entire movie, it does not feel necessary to have seen everything before to understand the final. It has some good things like talking about the beauty stereotypes that exist within the gay community, also judging someone by how they look and the prejudices that exist when seeing someone's way of dressing or expressing themselves, although it does not delve into these issues, is good that the plot mentions them. Other remarkable things about the film are the performances, everyone manages to give a convincing performance, this makes some moments seem real. The characters have very little development, as well as others not at all.I don't think it's a good movie, it doesn't work as a romantic comedy, nor does it manage to highlight some issues that are important to open a conversation about, I didn't empathize with the characters or their mission due to their lack of development, but I can say that there are some well-done scenes that kept my attention throughout the film despite its flaws, as part of the community I did not identify with the plot nor do I think it is an unmissable romantic comedy.",hateful characters,this is movie that has plot that can be resolved with conversation main conflict can be resolved very easily but because characters are toxic there is no communication between them we have this movie it is difficult define genre this film first it seems like comedy then dramatic comedy at last romantic comedy because this it was difficult me connect with story even though it has some good things characters are very annoying since their stubbornness is unbearable creates many conflicts story ending does not have much do with what they were telling us almost entire movie it does not feel necessary have seen everything before understand final it has some good things like talking about beauty stereotypes that exist within gay community also judging someone by how they look prejudices that exist when seeing someones way dressing or expressing themselves although it does not delve into these issues is good that plot mentions them other remarkable things about film are performances everyone manages give convincing performance this makes some moments seem real characters have very little development as well as others not at all i dont think its good movie it doesnt work as romantic comedy nor does it manage highlight some issues that are important open conversation about i didnt empathize with characters or their mission due their lack development but i can say that there are some well done scenes that kept my attention throughout film despite its flaws as part community i did not identify with plot nor do i think it is unmissable romantic comedy,0.6238505747126437,0.13170977011494253,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
4.0,"Lotsa drugs, booze and screamers, but not too many laughs","I don't think this film does any favors to the gay community especially on a streaming service available to view by so many for so many reasons and some of those will be for the wrong reasons. Laughing with gay people is not the same as laughing at them. This is only a depiction of a small, select section of gay men and the ancient stereotypes on constant display will only add fuel to the fire of haters, though I suppose those who hate will do so no matter what they see. Still, it is not an accurate depiction of the average gay man and I think that is damaging. As a rom-com, I suppose it's decent enough, but I'm not the one to judge that accurately as they are not my kind of film. There are a few funny lines, but many more wince worthy moments. I suppose if you don't find these types offensive, it's all pleasant enough in a silly way and some of the music is enjoyable. Booster is pretty much the star of this and is the best thing in it, but since he also wrote this, that is a half-hearted compliment.

3.0,Yes it's cringeworthy,"This is like a bad episode of Saved By The Bell with an all gay cast. And Margaret Cho as the guidance counselor.

7.0,I liked it...a lot,"Yes, as some of our reviewers pointed out, there are a number of stereotypes presented here. But guess what...they're stereotypes because there are lots of gay people out there that fit right into this lifestyle. It isn't all of gay life, but it's gay life for quite a few people.There were several strong performances here. The first being Joel Kim Booster. I had seen him in a few comedy standup routines and liked him, but I wasn't sure how good an actor he would be. I thought he was quite good. Conrad Ricamora is a fine actor that many people have seen on a number of television shows. He was fine here, but the way he was portrayed early on was problematic...I kept wondering, ""What's his problem?"" It would have helped the story along had we gotten to understand him a bit earlier. James Scully was very good, too.I think what I liked about the film was that, at least with some of the characters, they are sort of trapped in that stereotypical gay life, but still seeking more. They just haven't quite figured out what that 'more' is.

3.0,The script feels like a first draft,"It shouldn't be overlooked that Fire Island's existence is a massive win for the LGBTQ community as well as for the Asian community. Far too often queer characters (especially queer characters of color) are relegated to the snarky one note best friend character. To have a feature film written, directed, and starring queer people of color is incredible.That being said I wish I enjoyed the movie more. The script is very quippy, but often it trades a quick laugh in favor of moments that actually round out the characters. Joel Kim Booster's ""Noah"" doesn't feel like a real person. I think the problem originates from the characters lack of world view. Sure he goes on rants about the evils of capitalism and body image and being a minority, but these monologues are often surface level talking points you might find on social media. Noah's struggles seem separate from him as a character, as if Joel Kim Booster did a google search for ""problems gay men have"". It's this lack of specificity across the board that makes everyone feel like caricatures and less like empathetic characters.The script also has glaring plot holes in it. The group of gays make a huge fuss about losing the fire island home only for it to not matter in the end. Sure there's the age old ""it's not the house it's the people"" trope that gets shoehorned in to try to fix this plot hole, but the film leading up to that moment has nothing to do with characters learning that message. So the result is that it feels like sloppy writing or an artifact from a draft of the script that was intended to be a television pilot. Sloppy writing isn't new in queer cinema, but given the caliber of people attached to the movie, I was expecting something better. I feel like the movie as it's presented is a very solid first draft. Watching it I couldn't help but think ""there's something here"" but whatever it is gets bogged down by clunky writing and poor performances.That brings me to the acting in this film. Let's be honest, Joel Kim Booster, as beautiful as he is, cannot carry a movie. He's consistently outshined by his costars Bowen Yang and Margaret Cho in almost every scene. His lack of charisma on screen paired with the superficial and shallow script makes for a movie that's incredibly difficult to watch in one sitting.Overall Fire Island is a movie that tries to have its cake and eat it too (while ignoring the carbs so everyone's six packs are visible). The script lacks perspective beyond ""everyone's gay"" and any time a serious dialogue is started about a serious subject (race and body image come to mind) it's heavy handed while being simultaneously tone deaf. If you're a fan of Bowen Yang or Margaret Cho, the movie is fun for their scenes alone. The rest of the cast either hams it up like they're in a collegiate improv show or lacks any and all emotional depth. The result is a movie that is a decent freshman outing, but one that will be forgotten by this time next year.As a gay man myself, I think it's incredibly important to be honest about the queer media we're given. I think more queer people should have the opportunity to tell their stories, but the fact alone that queer BIPOC people are making something doesn't innately make it good or enjoyable.",script feels like first draft,it shouldnt be overlooked that fire islands existence is massive win lgbtq community as well as asian community far too often queer characters especially queer characters color are relegated snarky one note best friend character have feature film written directed starring queer people color is incredible that being said i wish i enjoyed movie more script is very quippy but often it trades quick laugh favor moments that actually round out characters joel kim boosters noah doesnt feel like real person i think problem originates characters lack world view sure he goes rants about evils capitalism body image being minority but these monologues are often surface level talking points you might find social media noahs struggles seem separate him as character as if joel kim booster did google search problems gay men have its this lack specificity across board that makes everyone feel like caricatures less like empathetic characters script also has glaring plot holes it group gays make huge fuss about losing fire island home only it not matter end sure theres age old its not house its people trope that gets shoehorned try fix this plot hole but film leading up that moment has nothing do with characters learning that message so result is that it feels like sloppy writing or artifact draft script that was intended be television pilot sloppy writing isnt new queer cinema but given caliber people attached movie i was expecting something better i feel like movie as its presented is very solid first draft watching it i couldnt help but think theres something here but whatever it is gets bogged down by clunky writing poor performances that brings me acting this film lets be honest joel kim booster as beautiful as he is cannot carry movie hes consistently outshined by his costars bowen yang margaret cho almost every scene his lack charisma screen paired with superficial shallow script makes movie thats incredibly difficult watch one sitting overall fire island is movie that tries have its cake eat it too while ignoring carbs so everyones six packs are visible script lacks perspective beyond everyones gay any time serious dialogue is started about serious subject race body image come mind its heavy handed while being simultaneously tone deaf if youre fan bowen yang or margaret cho movie is fun their scenes alone rest cast either hams it up like theyre collegiate improv show or lacks any all emotional depth result is movie that is decent freshman outing but one that will be forgotten by this time next year as gay man myself i think its incredibly important be honest about queer media were given i think more queer people should have opportunity tell their stories but fact alone that queer bipoc people are making something doesnt innately make it good or enjoyable,0.5224462809917355,0.17631772268135903,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Another Broken Hearts Club,"I know when I love a movie enough to give it 10/10 stars: When I watch ALL the way through the end credits - without obligation. (Yeah, I'm looking at you MCU, SMH.) In this case, lucky I did as they provided an awesome, way-better than Marvel end credits nice surprise.I had this movie pegged from the beginning as a 9/10-star film and was writing my review in my head that began with calling myself biased and not caring. I understood it was cliché, stereotypical and predictable and if it were a straight romcom, I'd hate or mildly dislike it. But, as this enormously hysterical, just straight-up romcom progressed, I fell madly in love with it.I laughed throughout. I laughed very hard at times. And I even cried multiple times. I thought this movie would be a worthy non-legacy sequel to 2000's The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy. But then I realized it was a worthy companion to it. This movie was just as perfect as that classic that I still love to this day, 22 years later.Friends reunite for their annual, week-long Fire Island party, but mostly for hooking up. The main plot comes from Noah's plans to fix-up his bestie, Howie, with a random. Little did he know with his meddling, multiple lives are affected, including his own.Now, while my life and old circle of friends may resemble the Broken Hearts Club more, I could still 100% relate to this next-gen crew. Sadly, they only VERY BRIEFLY covered anyone chubby, but they did make sure I was with them because of their social/economical status. There WERE other super rich characters involved, which is the norm in gay movies. Hardly anyone's featured down a few notches to the actual norm.What isn't the norm was the added bonus of not one incredibly hot Asian man, but two AND they were the leads. I have already been familiar with them, loving Bowen Yang from SNL and Joel Kim Booster from his stand-up. Truthfully, while I thought both were funny before this movie, I had no idea they could be this absolutely hilarious. And the chemistry between them was impenetrable.I'm going to buy this movie. The minute it comes off streaming, I will search for it. I just now looked for it on Amazon, but it wasn't listed. Probably because it's a HULU exclusive and wouldn't be for sale soon or hopefully it will be some day. I need to own this and periodically watch it alongside my copy of The Broken Hearts Club.Funny. I was going to watch the latest season of THE BOYS on Prime, but I saw they're doing that week-to-week release schedule after the first 3 dropped. I wanted to binge them all, so I decided to wait until they're all out. Happy I did. I found these even more wonderful BOYS.***Final Thoughts: Why do they have to make me feel guilty in the opening warning that this is ONLY FOR MATURE AUDIENCES? I may be what society calls an adult, but I still don't know when the mature part will kick in. Maybe retirement? I can't wait that long to see this, again!!",another broken hearts club,i know when i love movie enough give it 10 10 stars when i watch all way through end credits without obligation yeah im looking at you mcu smh this case lucky i did as they provided awesome way better than marvel end credits nice surprise i had this movie pegged beginning as 9 10 star film was writing my review my head that began with calling myself biased not caring i understood it was clich stereotypical predictable if it were straight romcom id hate or mildly dislike it but as this enormously hysterical just straight up romcom progressed i fell madly love with it i laughed throughout i laughed very hard at times i even cried multiple times i thought this movie would be worthy non legacy sequel 2000s broken hearts club romantic comedy but then i realized it was worthy companion it this movie was just as perfect as that classic that i still love this day 22 years later friends reunite their annual week long fire island party but mostly hooking up main plot comes noahs plans fix up his bestie howie with random little did he know with his meddling multiple lives are affected including his own now while my life old circle friends may resemble broken hearts club more i could still 100 relate this next gen crew sadly they only very briefly covered anyone chubby but they did make sure i was with them because their social economical status there were other super rich characters involved which is norm gay movies hardly anyones featured down few notches actual norm what isnt norm was added bonus not one incredibly hot asian man but two they were leads i have already been familiar with them loving bowen yang snl joel kim booster his stand up truthfully while i thought both were funny before this movie i had no idea they could be this absolutely hilarious chemistry between them was impenetrable im going buy this movie minute it comes off streaming i will search it i just now looked it amazon but it wasnt listed probably because its hulu exclusive wouldnt be sale soon or hopefully it will be some day i need own this periodically watch it alongside my copy broken hearts club funny i was going watch latest season boys prime but i saw theyre doing that week week release schedule after first 3 dropped i wanted binge them all so i decided wait until theyre all out happy i did i found these even more wonderful boys final thoughts why do they have make me feel guilty opening warning that this is only mature audiences i may be what society calls adult but i still dont know when mature part will kick maybe retirement i cant wait that long see this again,0.5779091591591591,0.15352852852852847,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.37}"

2.0,Seems like a bad time capsule from the 1970s,"If you've just awakened from a 45+ year coma and want an outdated view into your Grandfather's Fire Island, this is the movie for you. The characters are all latter-day stereotypes, promiscuous and cringeworthy, missing only 70's porn moustaches. The five ""boys,"" protected by predictable mother-hen lesbian Margaret Cho (was Rosie O'Donnell unavailable?), jiggle about wearing as little as possible, and speak the ""F"" and ""S"" words in almost every sentence, attempting to disguise a stupefying plot with crass dialogue. The romantic leads have no chemistry whatever, and the sex scenes are too graphic for what is supposed to be a light-hearted rom-com. Ultimately, this unfunny little movie conveys the worst relics of pre-AIDS culture while pretending to be a contemporary Gay comedy. We've long since moved on from embarrassing stereotypical material like this.BTW, any correlation between this film and Pride and Prejudice is too laughable to even mention.",seems like bad time capsule 1970s,if youve just awakened 45 year coma want outdated view into your grandfathers fire island this is movie you characters are all latter day stereotypes promiscuous cringeworthy missing only 70s porn moustaches five boys protected by predictable mother hen lesbian margaret cho was rosie odonnell unavailable jiggle about wearing as little as possible speak f s words almost every sentence attempting disguise stupefying plot with crass dialogue romantic leads have no chemistry whatever sex scenes are too graphic what is supposed be light hearted rom com ultimately this unfunny little movie conveys worst relics pre aids culture while pretending be contemporary gay comedy weve long since moved embarrassing stereotypical material like this btw any correlation between this film pride prejudice is too laughable even mention,0.58,-0.15208333333333332,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.05, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"
6.0,A cliche-riddled journey towards a warm heart,"I struggled with the first hour. It amped up the current-day gay cliches to extreme proportions. The dialogue was solely based around gay men, with gay personalities, talking about being gay, and discussing gay issues which left no space for anything else. On top of that you've got the lead character narrating throughout the entire movie about how we as the audience should feel about gay life. There was a lot of telling not showing.However, in the moments when the plot positioned the social commentary to the background and had a chance to actually explore gay issues by seeing these men in various situations, as superficial as the exploration may have been, ultimately led to a well-meaning warm-hearted place. There were moments of genuine insight, and occasional laugh out loud moments peppered throughout, and Margaret Cho will never not be a delight to watch.However the outcome felt a little undercooked and reliant on stereotyped one liners that often didn't land and an idea of what a gay screenwriter thinks what gay men want to see. I would have loved a high comedy version of the HBO TV series 'Looking' type experience where no cliches are allowed and all characters have depth and dimension. This exploration felt a little cynical, mean and lazy in parts.",cliche riddled journey towards warm heart,i struggled with first hour it amped up current day gay cliches extreme proportions dialogue was solely based around gay men with gay personalities talking about being gay discussing gay issues which left no space anything else top that youve got lead character narrating throughout entire movie about how we as audience should feel about gay life there was lot telling not showing however moments when plot positioned social commentary background had chance actually explore gay issues by seeing these men various situations as superficial as exploration may have been ultimately led well meaning warm hearted place there were moments genuine insight occasional laugh out loud moments peppered throughout margaret cho will never not be delight watch however outcome felt little undercooked reliant stereotyped one liners that often didnt land idea what gay screenwriter thinks what gay men want see i would have loved high comedy version hbo tv series looking type experience where no cliches are allowed all characters have depth dimension this exploration felt little cynical mean lazy parts,0.558409090909091,0.17063131313131316,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.48}"
