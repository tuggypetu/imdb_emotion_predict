10.0,Masterpiece alert!,"Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don't need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers' comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most ""satisfying"". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it's only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. On another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains ""propaganda"" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it's a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It's astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin ""was no better than Hitler"" has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie's context - Klimov's picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it's about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema. I've always believed there's something special about Russians when it comes to producing art, especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me.",masterpiece alert,even before final credits rolled i strongly suspected this movie would end up my top 20 fact perhaps even my top 10 teenage boy his hearing impaired having just been at site bombing young woman clutching at him two them stumbling sludging through slimy smelly bog stork woods as it rains cluster dolls piled up floor with flies buzzing all over room you dont need vast elaborately choreographed battle scenes bring home message senselessness pain war reading viewers comments movie it seems that most found second half which admittedly contained some most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed as most satisfying few other viewers seem imply movie doesnt really get going until second half me it was first half that got under my skin most its cinematic originality poetry symbolic power war is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers this may seem like obvious statement but its only after watching come see that you realise how few war movies are truly about suffering ordinary man woman defenseless child frail senior citizen also never before had i seen plight raped women war so powerfully conveyed all this without movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic cinema rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex it isnt always quite clear why women get so upset over it come see rape is shown as nothing but pure unadulterated hate fuelled violence with only superficial external resemblance sex unlike other raped women film you cannot imagine those come see ever healing their scars another subject whoever thinks this movie contains propaganda is obviously prejudiced against movie simply because its soviet production should think things over little more carefully its astonishing how you can still find little traces cold war mentality surviving this day even younger viewers fact that as detractors come see claim stalin was no better than hitler has nothing do with anything at all this movies context klimovs picture is not about nationalistic oneupmanship who had worst tyrant its about basic suffering ordinary humanity war any war though this one happened be going bielorussia there was fact ten times more propaganda ten minutes saving private ryan than whole come see this is painful sublime cinema ive always believed theres something special about russians when it comes producing art especially literature this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression me,0.5025297619047618,0.04395461309523812,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,One of the greatest wars films ever made,"One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands.At the heart of the narrative is Floyra, both viewer and victim of the appalling events making up the film's narrative, his history a horrendous coming-of-age story. It begins with him laboriously digging out a weapon to use and much changed at the end, he finally uses one. As he travels from initial innocence, through devastating experience, on to stunned hatred, in a remarkable process he ages before our eyes, both inside and out. His fresh face grows perceptibly more haggard as the film progresses, frequently staring straight back at the camera, as if challenging the viewer to keep watching; or while holding his numbed head, apparently close to mental collapse. Often shot directly at the boy or from his point of view, the formal quality of Klimov's film owes something to Tarkovsky's use of the camera in Ivan's Childhood, although the context is entirely different.The film's title is from the Book of Revelations, referring to the summoning of witnesses to the devastation brought by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 'Come and See' is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war, but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path, witnessing with vivid immediacy the Belorussion holocaust at close hand. Here, the intensity of what is on offer justifies amplification by the use of a travelling camera, point-of-view shots, and some startlingly surreal effects pointing up unnatural events: the small animal clinging nervously to the German commander's arm for instance, soundtrack distortions, or the mock Hitler sculpted out of clay and skull.Main character Floyra is the director's witness to events, a horrified visitor forced, like us to 'see' - even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly. For instance during their return to the village, there is some doubt as to if Floyra is yet, or will be ever, able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events. In one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them, Glasha's reaction to off-screen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling. So much so, we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on. Its a watershed of innocence: one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm Floyra - just as later, more explicit horrors do the viewer.Come And See was not an easy shoot. It lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including, at one point, wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp. Kravchenko's face is unforgettable during this and other experiences, and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences. The sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, as did elements of a much-commented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire. Klimov's camera ranges through and around the atrocities, although one doubts that a steady cam was available. By the end Florya is isolated from humanity, technically as well as mentally, by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground. Disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are, others such as the scene where Florya and the partisan girl Rose visit the forest after the bombing, achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the Hollywood production. And whereas Spielberg's work concludes with a dramatic irony that's perhaps a little too neat, contrived for different audience tastes, Klimov's less accommodating epic finishes on a unique, cathartic moment - no doubt partly chosen to avoid any bathos after events just witnessed, but one which sends real blame back generations.Hallucinatory, heartrending, traumatic and uncompromising, such a movie will not to be all tastes. It certainly does not make for relaxing viewing, although those who see it often say it remains with them for years after. This was Klimov's last film for, as he said afterwards ""I lost interest in making films. Everything that was possible I felt had already been done,"" no doubt referring to the emotional intensity of his masterpiece, which would be hard to top. By the end of their own viewing, any audience ought to be shocked enough to pick up a rifle themselves and vengefully join the home army setting out to fight the Great Patriotic War - a necessarily stalwart response without limit of participation, symbolised by the director who tracks a camera through the dense forest before finally rejoining a column of soldiers heading to the front. If you feel, like I do, that any real war film should succeed in conveying the power and pity of it all, then Come And See is an absolute go and watch.",one greatest wars films ever made,one greatest

9.0,Apocalypse Then,"In all fairness, this Belorussian-made World War II picture detailing Nazi atrocities, holds a special distinction in world cinema: it is by far the most brutal and emotionally draining of all - in fact, a viewer whose senses have not been properly trained would most likely find it unwatchable. Those brave souls willing to be put through an ordeal of almost 2 1/2 hours will find themselves deeply immersed in an absolutely horrifying experience that will not easily subside whether they want it to or not.The title, ""Come and See"", taken from the frequently repeating lines of the book of Revelation, clearly dares the audience to assume the role of St. John, witnessing the Apocalypse, or rather one of the darkest periods in the history of humankind. What we are assaulted with, plays somewhat like a demented version of ""Modern Times"" transpiring across the panel of Brueghel's ""Trimuph of Death"", if such a combination is possible. The camera is consistently filtered through a murky, slightly unfocused gaze, and the sound is often heard through shellshocked ears. This tends to eirly distance the events, yet make them even more frightening and unsettling. Much of the dialogue lacks specific meaning or even concrete sentences - it is replaced by subhuman growling, wailing and other spine-chilling, gluttural sounds of the war. What the director prepares is something Spielberg would never even dream of - no sign of compromise with the audience. A crowd of civilian villagers locked up in a barn by Nazi soldiers is not spared at the last minute like ""Schindler List's"" Jews- they are burned alive, and we get to watch all of it.Unlike most of the films in this genre, ""Come and see"" relies mainly on images and sounds instead of a coherent plot, which is not necesserily a weakness, since the sheer terror distorts time and space into a kind of hallucinatory blur, clearly intentional and understandable. But this incredible level of bleak intensity in the long run, has a negative effect on the film: the viewers have to desensitize themselves just so they can keep watching, so the most harrowing scenes are sat through in numbness.Another questionable move on the director's part is his occasional use of surrealism. While some visuals are painfully believable, while others are simply baffling: crazed villages consructing an effigy of Hitler, a pensive German commander with a pet slender loris (a rare African primate) on his shoulder, a female Nazi eating raw red lobster, not even mentioning a bizzare final montage wich is both inexplicable and obvious, ending with a real-life photograph that is perhaps the most terrifying of all in its implications. Yes, at times the movie overachieves its goals and seems almost like the footage in ""The Clockwork Orange"" that they made Alex watch to cure him of ""ultraviolent"" behaviour; yet other times it delivers the kind of jolts those accustomed to mainstream cinema could only wish they had. The face of a youth who had lost all sanity and aged many decades over several days, will be etched for an indefinite amount of time into the memory of anyone who has seen this film.",apocalypse then,all fairness this belorussian made world war ii picture detailing nazi atrocities holds special distinction world cinema it is by far most brutal emotionally draining all fact viewer whose senses have not been properly trained would most likely find it unwatchable those brave souls willing be put through ordeal almost 2 1 2 hours will find themselves deeply immersed absolutely horrifying experience that will not easily subside whether they want it or not title come see taken frequently repeating lines book revelation clearly dares audience assume role st john witnessing apocalypse or rather one darkest periods history humankind what we are assaulted with plays somewhat like demented version modern times transpiring across panel brueghels trimuph death if such combination is possible camera is consistently filtered through murky slightly unfocused gaze sound is often heard through shellshocked ears this tends eirly distance events yet make them even more frightening unsettling much dialogue lacks specific meaning or even concrete sentences it is replaced by subhuman growling wailing other spine chilling gluttural sounds war what director prepares is something spielberg would never even dream no sign compromise with audience crowd civilian villagers locked up barn by nazi soldiers is not spared at last minute like schindler lists jews they are burned alive we get watch all it unlike most films this genre come see relies mainly images sounds instead coherent plot which is not necesserily weakness since sheer terror distorts time space into kind hallucinatory blur clearly intentional understandable but this incredible level bleak intensity long run has negative effect film viewers have desensitize themselves just so they can keep watching so most harrowing scenes are sat through numbness another questionable move directors part is his occasional use surrealism while some visuals are painfully believable while others are simply baffling crazed villages consructing effigy hitler pensive german commander with pet slender loris rare african primate his shoulder female nazi eating raw red lobster not even mentioning bizzare final montage wich is both inexplicable obvious ending with real life photograph that is perhaps most terrifying all its implications yes at times movie overachieves its goals seems almost like footage clockwork orange that they made alex watch cure him ultraviolent behaviour yet other times it delivers kind jolts those accustomed mainstream cinema could only wish they had face youth who had lost all sanity aged many decades over several days will be etched indefinite amount time into memory anyone who has seen this film,0.5540121336996335,0.038302712912087915,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,Possibly the definitive Russian front film,"""Come and See"" is bizarre, disturbing, and haunting. It is more moving and enlightening than all of the other (mostly disappointing) films I have seen depicting the Russian front in World War II. Strangely enough, the Red Army is entirely absent from the movie.As a Russian film, it begins less conventionally than most films produced in the west. It starts off very surreal, and it is difficult at some points to understand what is going on or what certain characters are doing. This gives the theme a foreign and realistic feel. We follow the life of a peasant boy in Byleorussia in 1943, as he joins the partisans. Certain events involving his family and his introduction to the partisans (especially one involving a young girl) make his fight more personal. Strange interactions between characters and Director Elem Klimov's follow tracking shots dominate the film, and give it a unique method of storytelling. Then the nightmare begins.The destruction of a Russian village is the horrific centerpiece of the story. It is brutally realistic, with more tracking shots that hold for long periods of time without cutting. We see the German Wehrmacht burn a barn loaded with civilians to the ground as these soldiers clap, smile, and embrace each other. The chaotic action involves many scenes that are sporadic (flames burning out of control, a German soldier accidently shoved into the barn house with the victims) and possibly improvised, which lend a great authenticity to the material. The images are unforgettable, and will stay with you long after you've seen the film. Klimov has succeeded in putting the viewer in the village. Surprisingly, despite coming out of the Soviet Union in 1985, ""Come and See"" never felt to me like propaganda. There was no communist rhetoric, and the heroes were all partisans, many of which were flawed. The Germans aren't caricatures at the same time they commit acts of evil, and view their actions in a banal way. When one of them defends the atrocities of his platoon, he states, ""inferior races spread the microbes of communism."" The character delivers this line not with fierce anger, but with nonchalance, as if it were common knowledge, not something that he needs to explain to anyone. Some reviews have criticized the ""afterthought,"" a rewind of the Nazi rise to power and invasion of Europe, as unnecessary. It may be, but it is still powerful. Other ""flaws"" people find with the movie are all characteristics of the director's style, therefore I don't find them flaws. ""Come and See"" is a great, very different, and very moving film.

10.0,horrors of war in 1940s Belarus,"Elem Klimov's final film is a devastating look at the horrors of war through the eyes of a teenage boy who joins the partisans in Belarus (then the Byelorussian SSR or White Russian SSR). Much like Mike Nichols's ""Catch-22"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Idi i smotri"" (""Come and See"" in English) makes you feel as if the war is hitting you directly. And this movie leaves little to the imagination in showing the Nazis' brutality. Probably the most famous scene is when the Nazis burn down a house. There's music playing the entire time to ensure that the noise doesn't stop. You have rarely seen something as intense as this on screen.Klimov's wife Larisa Shepitko directed the equally intense movie ""The Ascent"", about some Soviet troops who try to defend a house from the Nazis (Shepitko got killed in a car wreck a few years later). The important thing to remember is that the Soviet Union lost almost 27 million people fighting the Nazis, more than any other country (it probably would've been more if the winter hadn't held the Nazis back). There's a reason why Russians still refer to the Great Patriotic War, as opposed to simply World War II. And this is one of the many movies that emphasize it. Definitely watch it.",horrors war 1940s belarus,elem klimovs final film is devastating look at horrors war through eyes teenage boy who joins partisans belarus then byelorussian ssr or white russian ssr much like mike nicholss catch 22 steven spielbergs saving private ryan idi i smotri come see english makes you feel as if war is hitting you directly this movie leaves little imagination showing nazis brutality probably most famous scene is when nazis burn down house theres music playing entire time ensure that noise doesnt stop you have rarely seen something as intense as this screen klimovs wife larisa shepitko directed equally intense movie ascent about some soviet troops who try defend house nazis shepitko got killed car wreck few years later important thing remember is that soviet union lost almost 27 million people fighting nazis more than any other country it probably wouldve been more if winter hadnt held nazis back theres reason why russians still refer great patriotic war as opposed simply world war ii this is one many movies that emphasize it definitely watch it,0.46107006020799124,0.09765325670498085,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,"I saw a film today , oh boy...","I have a bad habit of reading too many reviews and comments about a film before I've seen it, mainly to get an idea about whether it's going to be worth a couple of hours of my time watching it. As a result, I am often slightly disappointed with much of what I see, as all the hype that I've read about a film kind of blows my expectations out of all proportion. I had a feeling this would be the case with Elem Klimov's 'Come and See', a film I'd read a lot about, particularly here on the IMDb. (Imagine my ""excitement"" when, having tried to see the film for nearly a year, I discovered it was to be released on DVD a week or two ago from today!) Well, I finally watched the film yesterday and... well, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer intensity and unflinching visceral horror of the atrocities that 'Come and See' invites us to... come and see. (Has anyone commented before on what a clever title that actually is...?) This is one of those films, like, say, 'Requiem For A Dream' or 'The Magdalene Sisters' (both of which, though great films, are simply not in the same league as Klimov's film), that one does not (obviously) so much enjoy as submit oneself to. By the end of such films we are left numbed and shell-shocked, wondering what we are supposed to do with the intense emotions that have been evoked within us. Yes, I felt like the ground had been pulled from beneath me; yes, what I saw in that film made my blood boil, my head hurt and my heart pound; and, yes, it showed me things I'd seen before but to a degree of intensity and detail that I had not experienced before. The point though, I guess, is that the role of cinema (and art in general) is not to offer answers or tell us what to think but to simply show us particular events and characters and allow us to come to our own decisions about what those things 'mean'. I'm rambling now, but I'll simply end by saying that 'Come and See' is, with its outstanding technical and artistic credentials aside, a film whose very title alone demands that it be seen. It is the work of a visionary, a cry of despair from the depths of hell, and an important reminder of humanity's capacity for inhumanity Go and see...",i saw film today oh boy,i have bad habit reading too many reviews comments about film before ive seen it mainly get idea about whether its going be worth couple hours my time watching it as result i am often slightly disappointed with much what i see as all hype that ive read about film kind blows my expectations out all proportion i had feeling this would be case with elem klimovs come see film id read lot about particularly here imdb imagine my excitement when having tried see film nearly year i discovered it was be released dvd week or two ago today well i finally watched film yesterday well nothing could have prepared me sheer intensity unflinching visceral horror atrocities that come see invites us come see has anyone commented before what clever title that actually is this is one those films like say requiem dream or magdalene sisters both which though great films are simply not same league as klimovs film that one does not obviously so much enjoy as submit oneself by end such films we are left numbed shell shocked wondering what we are supposed do with intense emotions that have been evoked within us yes i felt like ground had been pulled beneath me yes what i saw that film made my blood boil my head hurt my heart pound yes it showed me things id seen before but degree intensity detail that i had not experienced before point though i guess is that role cinema art general is not offer answers or tell us what think but simply show us particular events characters allow us come our own decisions about what those things mean im rambling now but ill simply end by saying that come see is with its outstanding technical artistic credentials aside film whose very title alone demands that it be seen it is work visionary cry despair depths hell important reminder humanitys capacity inhumanity go see,0.5742965367965369,0.057196969696969704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,"And I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder...","Come and See (1985)**** I first saw this movie a couple of years ago. I didn't really know what to think of it at first. The soundtrack on the DVD is a little messy and the acting was a bit strange. I knew it had affected me though in a way that not many other movies had. As time went by I began to realize just how much of an impact the movie had on me. It really, really stuck with me. One night, while writing a review of Errol Morris's latest documentary ""Fog of War"", I found myself thinking more and more about Come and See, and decided that I had to watch it again immediately. I ran out after midnight and rented it, and watched it 3 times or so over the next week. I started to see why the film had been haunting me and sticking around my thoughts. The reason was that this movie is simply a masterpiece.Elem Klimov directs the film, starring Aleksei Kravchenko as Florya, a young boy who desires to fight with the Partisan's army against the invading Nazi army. He digs until he finds a rifle, then the next day he is off to a camp in the middle of the woods. The scene is chaotic it seems and unorganized. The fighters try to take a photo that takes about 5 minutes to accomplish because everyone keeps messing up their positions. Florya spots Glasha (Olga Mironova), a young girl, who has the younger fighters swooning over her, and who also seems to have some sort of relationship with the leader of the camp. What that relationship is exactly we never find out. Florya gets left behind on the attack because he is perhaps too young, and besides another older fighter needs some new boots, and swaps with the new kid. .The anxious Florya is upset by this decision and he takes to the woods for some solitude, he cries and then discovers that near by Glasha is also crying at being left at the camp, more so for being left alone than behind. The two begin to bond and end up in an open field when German planes attack and begin to bomb the encampment. The scenes that follow next teeter on the brink of madness on film. Come and See is likely one of the most maddening films ever made for that matter. The key is the soundtrack. Florya is struck deaf for a few moments by the bombs. Sounds are muffled, but not like anything you've ever seen in a Hollywood film. The soundtrack is a mix of strange ringing and sounds and music, adding to the atmosphere of chaos that the two youngsters have now been thrown into. Much of the film has this style of soundtrack, which makes the Florya's descent into madness much more poignant.The film movies forward from here back to Florya's village which has now been deserted. The two head to an island on the other side of a bog where Florya believes the town is hiding along with his mother and sisters. The scene where they climb through the mud is another example of Florya losing his mind. The soundtrack again becomes ambient and menacing in its strange blends of sounds. They eventually find some villagers and Florya now even more loses his sanity, along with some of his hair, which is given to recreate a statue of Hitler. This will be the last time we see Glasha in the movie, as Florya goes with a party to collect food for the starving people.The most famous scene, and the one that will likely never leave you, is of a village being ransacked by Nazi soldiers. The scene is chaotic and culminates in a barn stuffed with the townspeople being burned and shot apart. Another one of the most famous shots from the movie is of Florya shooting a photo of Hitler, each bullet making time reverse. The photo goes back in time until it is a picture of Hitler as a baby on his mothers lap. He is an innocent infant, and Florya cannot bring himself to fire another shot. These shots are incredibly powerful and they stick in your mind.Obviously, Come and See was filmed with influences of Soviet Propaganda in it, but it hardly matters because it is so well made and so maddening you can't help but be totally absorbed by the experience. The movie has a hypnotic quality about it, and without being horrifying because it's a jump out of your seat surprise bloodbath, it is horrifying in its representation of the cruelty people are capable of in war.I can't remember ever seeing another film that expressed the descent into madness any better and being so involving as Come and See. By the end of the film, you feel like you've just experienced what it must be like to lose your mind. The film never goes into the desensitizing of violence in war. Instead it focuses on the violence which causes those who witness to become desensitized from the madness of its cruelty.Elem Klimov created this film out of his actors and their emotions, and essentially used the viewer as another character. This movie draws you in and makes you experience exactly what the characters must. There are few other films that do that to you, especially to the extent that this one does it. And for that, Come and See is not only a masterpiece, it's really one of the best films you'll ever see. Find it, but don't just watch it. Allow it to take you in; even if that means you have to see it a couple times. Let it take you in, and you're in for an experience rarely found in cinema anymore",i heard one four living creatures saying as with voice thunder,come see 1985 i first saw this movie couple years ago i didnt really know what think it at first soundtrack dvd is little messy acting was bit strange i knew it had affected me though way that not many other movies had as time went by i began realize just how much impact movie had me it really really stuck with me one night while writing review errol morriss latest documentary fog war i found myself thinking more more about come see decided that i had watch it again immediately i ran out after midnight rented it watched it 3 times or so over next week i started see why film had been haunting me sticking around my thoughts reason was that this movie is simply masterpiece elem klimov directs film starring aleksei kravchenko as florya young boy who desires fight with partisans army against invading nazi army he digs until he finds rifle then next day he is off camp middle woods scene is chaotic it seems unorganized fighters try take photo that takes about 5 minutes accomplish because everyone keeps messing up their positions florya spots glasha olga mironova young girl who has younger fighters swooning over her who also seems have some sort relationship with leader camp what that relationship is exactly we never find out florya gets left behind attack because he is perhaps too young besides another older fighter needs some new boots swaps with new kid anxious florya is upset by this decision he takes woods some solitude he cries then discovers that near by glasha is also crying at being left at camp more so being left alone than behind two begin bond end up open field when german planes attack begin bomb encampment scenes that follow next teeter brink madness film come see is likely one most maddening films ever made that matter key is soundtrack florya is struck deaf few moments by bombs sounds are muffled but not like anything youve ever seen hollywood film soundtrack is mix strange ringing sounds music adding atmosphere chaos that two youngsters have now been thrown into much film has this style soundtrack which makes floryas descent into madness much more poignant film movies forward here back floryas village which has now been deserted two head island other side bog where florya believes town is hiding along with his mother sisters scene where they climb through mud is another example florya losing his mind soundtrack again becomes ambient menacing its strange blends sounds they eventually find some villagers florya now even more loses his sanity along with some his hair which is given recreate statue hitler this will be last time we see glasha movie as florya goes with party collect food starving people most famous scene one that will likely never leave you is village being ransacked by nazi soldiers scene is chaotic culminates barn stuffed with townspeople being burned shot apart another one most famous shots movie is florya shooting photo hitler each bullet making time reverse photo goes back time until it is picture hitler as baby his mothers lap he is innocent infant florya cannot bring himself fire another shot these shots are incredibly powerful they stick your mind obviously come see was filmed with influences soviet propaganda it but it hardly matters because it is so well made so maddening you cant help but be totally absorbed by experience movie has hypnotic quality about it without being horrifying because its jump out your seat surprise bloodbath it is horrifying its representation cruelty people are capable war i cant remember ever seeing another film that expressed descent into madness any better being so involving as come see by end film you feel like youve just experienced what it must be like lose your mind film never goes into desensitizing violence war instead it focuses violence which causes those who witness become desensitized madness its cruelty elem klimov created this film out his actors their emotions essentially used viewer as another character this movie draws you makes you experience exactly what characters must there are few other films that do that you especially extent that this one does it that come see is not only masterpiece its really one best films youll ever see find it but dont just watch it allow it take you even if that means you have see it couple times let it take you youre experience rarely found cinema anymore,0.4331195887445888,0.06950284090909091,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Overwhelming masterpiece of a child's awakening to the realities of war,"This is one of the most realistic war films ever made, and it's the more realistic for being shown and exposed from the point of view of a child, which enhances the impact and makes the realism with its constantly increasing chain reaction of shocks, more and more growing to unbearable self-tormenting horrors and abhorrence, the more almost unendurable, but you have to stay on and see it all thorugh to the end. It is to be noted, that he never uses his rifle until in the very end, and the only target of his ultimate fire is some images. But that final outburst opens the finale of the greatest sequence of the film.You can't say too much about a film like this, words will never be enough, it is one of the greatest cinematographic experiences you'll ever have at the cinema, and although just one view of it all is enough for a lifetime, you will never be able to forget the details, and many sequences will recur in your mind, forcing you to consider this part of the war and its reality with no end to your shocked emotions and deeply disturbed indignation of an endless upset. It is very reminiscent of Tarkovsky, but it is better still than Tarkovsky, more realistic and more consistent in its absolute implementation. The Tarkovsky film that comes closest to this is his major masterpiece ""Anton Rublev"", which is equally consistent and overwhelming in its composition. But Elem Klimov and his writers go further, forcing the realism on their audience in constantly increasing crescendo in its horros, worse and more realistic than anything that Jerzy Kosinski wrote. This is a towering masterpiece of war films looming over all other war films, as it is a true story and almost more documentary than any realism could be for its unfathomable psychology in depicting a child's experience and reactions to all this.",overwhelming masterpiece childs awakening realities war,this is one most realistic war films ever made its more realistic being shown exposed point view child which enhances impact makes realism with its constantly increasing chain reaction shocks more more growing unbearable self tormenting horrors abhorrence more almost unendurable but you have stay see it all thorugh end it is be noted that he never uses his rifle until very end only target his ultimate fire is some images but that final outburst opens finale greatest sequence film you cant say too much about film like this words will never be enough it is one greatest cinematographic experiences youll ever have at cinema although just one view it all is enough lifetime you will never be able forget details many sequences will recur your mind forcing you consider this part war its reality with no end your shocked emotions deeply disturbed indignation endless upset it is very reminiscent tarkovsky but it is better still than tarkovsky more realistic more consistent its absolute implementation tarkovsky film that comes closest this is his major masterpiece anton rublev which is equally consistent overwhelming its composition but elem klimov his writers go further forcing realism their audience constantly increasing crescendo its horros worse more realistic than anything that jerzy kosinski wrote this is towering masterpiece war films looming over all other war films as it is true story almost more documentary than any realism could be its unfathomable psychology depicting childs experience reactions all this,0.5535714285714285,0.23402777777777775,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,A Soviet Perspective of World War II,"After finding an old rifle, a young boy joins the Soviet Army and experiences the horrors of World War II.Roger Ebert called this film ""one of the most devastating films ever about anything, and in it, the survivors must envy the dead... The film depicts brutality and is occasionally very realistic, but there's an overlay of muted nightmarish exaggeration... It must unfold as a surprise for you. It pretends to roll back history. You will see how. It is unutterably depressing, because history can never undo itself, and is with us forever."" That probably sums it up. This could be considered one of the greatest war films of all time, or at the very least one of the greatest World War II films of all time. The story is gruesome and realistic, and all the more terrifying for focusing on two children rather than the world of the adults.

10.0,Come And See If You Dare:,"Historical note:""The film concerns the Nazi policy of ""total annihilation"" in the republic of Byelorussia (now known as Belarus or White Russia, adjacent to Poland) in 1943. The racial policy of the Nazis was to eliminate all ""inferior races"" such as Jews and Slavs from Eastern Europe and to make land available for German settlement in the east (Lebensraum). Because of the importance of Eastern Europe to Nazi policy the bulk of the German Army was sent to the eastern rather than the western front. Estimated that 20 million or more Russians (by Russians I mean the people of many nationalities that included Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Jews and many others who used to live on the Soviet territories occupied by Germans during 1941-1943) died fighting Hitler (recent estimates place figure 25-30 million). Units of the SS (Schutzstaffel) and SD (Sicherheitsdienst) were used to carry out the genocide. The SD was separated from the main body of the German Army (Wehrmacht) and made up of fanatical Nazis and fascist East European (often from the Baltic) collaborators.""Elem Klimov's and Ales Adamovich's Film is perhaps one of the most powerful and horrifying films about the war (I would add Tarkovsky's ""The Childhood of Ivan"" aka ""Ivanovo Detstvo"" and Mikhail Romm's documentary ""Obyknovenny Fascism"" aka ""Ordinary Fascism"" aka ""Triumph Over Violence""). Not for a moment would the film let the viewer relax. With each scene, the feeling of horror increases. We are transformed into the main character, 16 year old boy Florya. We are forced to see with his eyes, to hear with his ears. In the beginning of the film, Florya is a child. At the end, after having witnessed the unspeakable terrors of the fascists, he becomes an adult, and not just an adult  an old man. His face is the face of War  and it is to us, the viewers, authors say  come and look in this face if you dare. War unmistakably selects as its victims the weakest, the youngest and the tenderest - the authors could not go against this truth. In the military camp, Florya meets the young girl, Glasha. Together, they try to make their way to the village where his family lived. But no one is there, it is empty - it is burnt out. And again some force pushes Florya, Glasha and us to go further. But where? To the shed where the women and the children are burning alive? Into the hands of the rapists- fascists? Or to be photographed with the revolver put at your temple, surrounded by the laughing SS-men? Is there any way out of the Inferno of War? The mystery of the final episode Florya can not force himself to shoot the child at the photograph sitting at his mother's lap. Even if the child's name is Adolph Hitler. Florya puts his rifle down. The clear blue sky is above him. Sounds Mozart's ""Requiem"". What is this? Victory? Or defeat? Did Florya survive or did he perish like millions and millions during the endless days, months, and years of the worst war the humankind had known? Even if survived physically, he is a changed forever man, the man who looked triumphant death and horror in the eye for too long to ever forget them.",come see if you dare,historical note film concerns nazi policy total annihilation republic byelorussia now known as belarus or white russia adjacent poland 1943 racial policy nazis was eliminate all inferior races such as jews slavs eastern europe make land available german settlement east lebensraum because importance eastern europe nazi policy bulk german army was sent eastern rather than western front estimated that 20 million or more russians by russians i mean people many nationalities that included russians ukrainians byelorussians jews many others who used live soviet territories occupied by germans during 1941 1943 died fighting hitler recent estimates place figure 25 30 million units ss schutzstaffel sd sicherheitsdienst were used carry out genocide sd was separated main body german army wehrmacht made up fanatical nazis fascist east european often baltic collaborators elem klimovs ales adamovichs film is perhaps one most powerful horrifying films about war i would add tarkovskys childhood ivan aka ivanovo detstvo mikhail romms documentary obyknovenny fascism aka ordinary fascism aka triumph over violence not moment would film let viewer relax with each scene feeling horror increases we are transformed into main character 16 year old boy florya we are forced see with his eyes hear with his ears beginning film florya is child at end after having witnessed unspeakable terrors fascists he becomes adult not just adult old man his face is face war it is us viewers authors say come look this face if you dare war unmistakably selects as its victims weakest youngest tenderest authors could not go against this truth military camp florya meets young girl glasha together they try make their way village where his family lived but no one is there it is empty it is burnt out again some force pushes florya glasha us go further but where shed where women children are burning alive into hands rapists fascists or be photographed with revolver put at your temple surrounded by laughing ss men is there any way out inferno war mystery final episode florya can not force himself shoot child at photograph sitting at his mothers lap even if childs name is adolph hitler florya puts his rifle down clear blue sky is above him sounds mozarts requiem what is this victory or defeat did florya survive or did he perish like millions millions during endless days months years worst war humankind had known even if survived physically he is changed forever man man who looked triumphant death horror eye too long ever forget them,0.36950585789871504,0.013729557479557487,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.55}"

This Picture set in 1943 occupied Byelorussia is most probably the most true to life war movie ever, only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can come close. What is amazing in this picture , is how the director uses a child's perspective and view in circumstances that you can only describe as evil. The director pulls no punches in how bad times actually were for peasents and partisans alike as German and collaborators show the viewer how low and depraved a fascist military machine actually is. I dont want to go into the plot , as this film is a MUST for anyone who considers themselves a film buff. Disturbing and terrifying scenes do not in anyway spoil the flow of the film , but when viewing this film , please desist from seeing this movie in the early evening , as you wont sleep.The acting accolades of course goes to the main characters , but I wish to give a special mention for the Russian Partisan Commander , who was just simply , superb. Everything about him was what you'd expect a Red Army Officer to be. The looks , the attitude and the steely determination is simply a credit to the actor. The best scene involving the Red Army Commander was when they had captured an Einsatgruppen Unit , and the SS soldier , who knew they were facing death was allowed to speak , after there own Commanding Officer was pleading pitifully for his own life. The SS soldier tells his captors that they are sub-human and that there peasent belief in Marxism was grounds enough that they should be eradicated. The Red Army Commander then in just a few words tells his men , that they are not just fighting for Socialism , but also the right to exist.What happens after...well you'll have to see.Come and See is nothing short of disturbing, awesome, powerful and brutal. This is the best film I have ever seen regarding films portraying the Eastern Front 1941-1945 war. This film should be engraved in gold as the standard for any budding war film director.

9.0,Once Seen Never Ever Forgotten,"Elem Klimov's COME AND SEE is a film best remembered for one scene and it'd probably be wrong to say it should be remembered for more that since THAT scene is one of the most disturbing and harrowing ever committed to celluloid . It also means the rest of the movie struggles hard to make up for it even though it tries . In many ways it's a throwback to the Soviet Home Front type of war movie mixed with Tarkovsky . Nature in all its imagery features prominently throughout the film . Forests are beautiful , green and silent on the surface but feature filthy , stinking swamps where a human can drown in . Man is also a hostage to the elements where rain soaks the skin and causes a human being to shiver . Man is not as fortunate as a bird who evolution has blessed with feathers and can sit on a swamp without sinking Like Andrie's Tarkovsky' 1962 film IVAN'S CHILDHOOD the story revolves around an older child - Florya - who finds himself caught up in the insanity of war in Byelorussia . While nature is cruel there's nothing more cruel than human tribalism coupled with unthinking ideology , a lesson Florya and the audience will find out later in the film . Until then the film concentrates on Florya's almost naive sense of adventure . The partisans leave him behind as they go to fight the Nazis so Florya wanders through the deep forests with his companion , an older girl called Glasha , perhaps blissfully unaware what the future holds for them both The film climaxes with an atrocity brought upon a village occupied by a Nazi death squad Einsatzkommando unit . People often use SCHINDLER'S LIST as the one film to show the brutality of the Nazi regime but to be honest the impact of Nazi atrocities may have a stronger impact here . There's a clinical ,impersonal feel to humans being murdered by zyklon B in gas chambers but to watch people being burned alive while the perpetrators laugh and treat the massacre as a nice day out does chill the blood . Worse still it's all based on truth . COME AND SEE finishes with a caption that 626 Byelorussian villages and their inhabitants were burnt to the ground . This was only in Bylorussia . This isn't counting the towns in Russia , Ukraine and other places in the USSR that was visited by Nazi murder squads . Disgracefully Mel Gibson recreated this very scene in THE PATRIOT where the British red coats committed an identical act even though there's no record of anything similar having happened during the American war of independence In conclusion COME AND SEE is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone even though it's sometimes distressing . It's this nihilistic and horrifying , brutal impact war has upon people in general and the young in particular that makes it a must see movie . It's also the last film director ElemKlimov ever made which is possibly just as well since it's the one one film a director should be remembered for .

10.0,One of the finest films of all time.,"World War II in Belarus, in the region near the Polish borders. Compelled by patriotism and youthful idealism one young boy (Aleksei Kravchenko) leaves his village to fight with the Soviet partisan resistance against the Nazi invasion. Within minutes his innocence is stripped away and the premature knowledge of war is revealed to him. He gets away from his unit and returns home, only to find the whole village including his family slaughtered and their bodies stacked behind an old farm!The horrendous depiction of war that Klimov creates is unique in the history of cinema. There is no plot, only a terrifying wandering in the nature, as the boy comes face to face with constant terrorizing and horrendous scenarios. Heroisms and sacrifices do not exist, nor inspiring speeches that excite the people to resist and fight the enemy. There is only the unexpected, death, violence and victims! A poem of a nightmare, relentlessly grim, deeply disturbing, and made unquestionably more dread-inducing by the fact that almost everything depicted really happened, it is a depressing but necessary reminder of one of the darkest chapters in human history. Idi i Smotri also manages to be both poetic and realistic and that is a supreme accomplishment on the part of the director.The film depicts real and surreal images that only war can justify. Transporting us back to World War II setting with its aptly-chosen locations and era-appropriate set pieces Alexei Rodionov's documentarian cinematography incorporates a lot of steady-cam and captures the events without any interruptions by employing long takes, and stands as one of the best films to use it as extensively as this one does, while desaturated colour tones add an urgency and bleak feel to its aura. The imagery at times is darkly psychedelic and truly arouses a sense of fear within the viewer because Fliora's surroundings are often made to seem out of this world. Such an image is the one where a soldier of the resistance, using mud, pieces of wood and a Nazi uniform, creates a German soldier totem. The widows and the mothers attack the totem and destroy it in a primitive act of violence and catharsis. There are moments in which the film is depicted through the eyes of the protagonist, and all sounds collapse into oblivion, reinforcing his deafness after the bombs' explosions.Come and See is one of the most affecting and confrontational war films ever made. The majority of war films claiming to be anti-war, show heroic acts with weapons and very capable soldiers that can save the day. Come and see does not offer such relief and comfort. It shows that in the war there are only victims. Though no one could possibly describe the experience of watching Come and See as a fun time, the film is nonetheless a masterpiece, worthy of consideration as not just the best war movie ever made, but also one of the greatest films ever made.

,What happened in the Soviet Union during WWII...,"This is the greatest war movie ever. The best way to describe it, I reckon, is to pass on a newspaper article written by Ilya Ehrenburg during World War II when all the things which happen in ""Come and See"" were happening:NIKOLAI VLADIMIROVICH -- ONE YEAR OLD Red Star, November 30 1943How much the Germans have taken from us! They have taken from us not only loved ones, homes, and possessions. Life was complicated. There were dreams, joys, people, many books, many countries. But now everything in me is unchangeably focused on one thing: on the German. I see him -- blue-eyed and inhuman. He walks and kills, he sings and kills, he laughs and kills.Among the papers of the town head of the village of Vyazovaya, recently liberated from the Germans, was found the following document:""List of executed residents of the village of Vyazovaya, Uzninskaya region:1) Muzalevskaya Natalia Ivanovna. 43 years old. 2) Muzalevskaya Natalia Nikolaevna. 18 years old. 3) Muzalevskaya Diana Nikolaevna. 16 years old. 4) Muzalevsky Lev Nikolaevich. 13 years old. 5) Muzalevskaya Valentina Nikolaevna. 9 years old. 6) Muzalevskaya Tamara Nikolaevna. 5 years old. 7) Muzalevskaya Rima Nikolaevna. 3 years old. 8) Davydov Vladimir Ilych. 35 years old. 9) Davydov Anatoli Vladimirovich. 8 years old. 10) Davydov Victor Vladimirovich. 5 years old. 11) Davydov Nikolai Vladimirovich. 1 year old. 12) Pryadochkina Maria Petrovna. 60 years old.19 September 1942. Town head Muzalev.""Can this be forgotten? Is it possible to live knowing that people are walking the earth who shot Davydov Nikolai Vladimirovich to death, one year old, an infant, the baby Kolya, shot him and ordered his name entered into a list? It is hard to talk about it, but impossible to forget. We still have a long way to go. But we will get there. We will find them. We will find them under their beds, in their vegetarian cafeterias, at the ends of the Earth. We will remember the one-year-old Kolya Davydov. We will remember much. **********The director, Klimov, concentrates on faces. From the faces you can see what they saw. Come. Come and see what this war was about in the Soviet Union. This was a war to the death; the Soviets knew and the Germans knew it. The Germans knew it because their leaders declared it so and 23 million Soviets paid with their lives.

,Makes Schindler's List look like Sesame Street,"Elem Klimov directs ""Come and See"". While the film predominantly follows the rites-of-passage journey of a young boy, it is remarkable how often and effortlessly Klimov shifts visual perspective, offering us the objective and subjective states of a wide range of characters and objects. For example, in one of the films most surreal scenes, several characters are shown guiding a cow across what seems to be open and unguarded terrain. Suddenly a series of intense firefights break out. Several characters are killed, but it is the fate of the cow with which the film is most preoccupied.The images of the cow standing untouched by the raging skirmish, then struck by a barrage of bullets, and finally of its eyes rapidly shifting and dilating before death, are indicative of ""Come and See's"" ability to produce indelible images from what are often quite standard war film situations. Like Malick, Klimov is as much interested in the landscape (and the objects and people that inhabit it), as he is in representing the minutiae and widening horror of his protagonist's journey from home to the multiple sites of slaughter and genocide that mar his countryside.The journey of a wide-eyed innocent across apocalyptic terrain is common territory for the war film (Ichikawa's ""The Burmese Harp"", Tarkovsky's ""Ivan's Childhood"", ""The Human Condition"" etc), but Klimov is going for a much more macabre tone, bludgeoning us with the sheer intensity and sick morbidity of his images.Unlike, say, ""Schindler's List"", ""Come and See"" is also remarkable for its use of abstract colour and sound. This is not a realist film; its shocks and effects are more dreamlike, from the mutedness of its burnished cinematography, to the extraordinary close-ups of several of its characters' impossibly aged faces, to the hyper expressive performances of many of its actors, to the impressionistic and at times almost expressionistic use of sound. In this context, the title of the film is not just a call for audiences to bear witness, to ""see"" that which is not imaginable, that which has little visual record, and to get a sense of the physical conditions (the ""come"" of the title) experienced by those during the war, but a description or pointer towards the more spectatorial expectations of the film. Of course the order ""come and see"" also functions as an exploitative challenge; ""Come and see if you dare!"" Indeed, many Chinese war-porn/propaganda films feature eerily similar titles.The film is essentially an epic journey and many of its images possess an almost Dantesque quality. It can also be seen as a ""coming of age"" film, a remarkable ""coming"" or progression (or is it regression?) that is etched upon the utterly transformed face of its central character. Unsurprisingly, Spielberg screened ""Come and See"" several times for cast and crew prior to shooting his Holocaust film. ""See"" would prove a huge influence on Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Wr Horse"" and ""Private Ryan"", in its mixture of child-like innocence (lots of dollying in to the shocked children's faces) and brutality. This is the worst aspect of Klimov's legacy, his film opening the doorway for an onslaught of other shock-porn movies - all the way to Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" - all of which pretend to be history lessons and important ""humane"" testimonies, when in reality they simply use progressions in technology to escalate violence levels, push tolerance levels and are built around a primary need to jolt apathetic, desensitised audiences. Hilariously, as war-porn gets more hard-core, in real life the numbers of genocides, wars and atrocities demonstrably increase, whilst media coverage decreases and public apathy increases. This is the mistake of all ""war films"": people don't repeat because they forget (the implication being that we must therefore shock ourselves into awareness), we forget because we repeat (see ""The Shining""). The human animal needs denial more than food.So while ""Come and See"" and its Spielberg imitators lack any real historical depth, complexity, nuance, understanding of human beings, and trade in simple exploitation, they also possess a kind of psychological naivety, perhaps best exemplified by Klimov's final scene, in which a kid essentially refuses to shoot a young Hitler. WW2's engine had little to do with Hitler, but here he's reduced to the genesis of evil, the seed from which WW2 blossoms.Though commissioned by the Soviet Union as a propaganda piece, ""Come and See"" was made shortly prior to the fall of the Iron Curtain, a period in which artists had a certain amount of freedom. Klimov's films is thus at times self consciously a meditation on Stalinist war films. In this regard the film literally begins upon the beach where Tarkovsky's ""Ivan"" ends, from where it attempts to create a new ""war narrative"", shunting aside Stalinist glorification for a kind of psychological shell shock. The result, though, is basically a Soviet version of ""Men Behind the Sun"", the infamous Chinese propaganda film in which we're called to bear witness to the activities of sadistic Japanese soldiers. In Klimov's case - the film focuses on the Nazi atrocities in Byelorussia - we leer at sadistic, vile, rapacious, murderous and cowardly Nazis while Communist partisans are portrayed as playful, comradely and righteous people. If a countries leadership willingly sided with the Germans from 1939-41, invaded countries (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland etc) carried out numerous atrocities against other nations and their own people and supported the Gulag system, then the viewer needs to be extremely careful when they view material that has been officially sanctioned by that leadership.8/10 -

10.0,"""The soundtrack is boring""","To write a simple review seems to be an easy task. Let's complicate the matters a bit. If You have time and inclination, perceive my point and method of commenting this particular movie. All right, here we go. What do we have on the negative side? The following lines are taken out from the IMDb reviews.1 ""The soundtrack is boring, without any decent music at all... Indeed, this is not a realistic film in any way, shape or form... Its propaganda, devoid of any artistic merit. I give it the minimum score because of its extreme pro-Soviet bias, which makes the film offensive and indeed Soviet propaganda"". (by Jose Cruz)2 ""And I love films, but really films are supposed to be entertaining. Or shocking. Or thought provoking. This is so tedious it feels like the director is calling the viewers bluff"". (by robc-26 from United Kingdom)3 ""A war movie should educate the viewer in any of a number of ways. We should appreciate courage and sacrifice, we should empathise with the cold, hungry and terrified. We should be told about historical events and their impact on the final outcome"". (by Reebox from United Kingdom)4 ""Lack of dialogue and explanation means that much of the time you don't know who people are or where they're going or what they hope to accomplish when they get there"". (by hanfuzzy from Barrie, Ontario, Canada)5 ""The character of the boy doesn't seem developed enough and the imagery presented in some so-called ""intense"" scenes did not truly attract my attention nor made me empathize with the character"". (by dubbs37 from United States)6 ""Bad lead character development"". (by entej from Russian Federation)7 ""The film is very slow and at many times throughout, nothing much is happening... The long, ringing in your ears, muted sound is off putting and not effective"". (by richard6 from United Kingdom)8 ""I wanted to see more actual fighting, and how the war was perceived by soldiers not a 12 year old boy..."" (by Steve Johnson (twiglet-1))9 ""The Nazis was professional killers, OK, but they were yet civilized (if I could say so) beside of a savage hypocrite murders called russians with their red army!.. Nazis were stupid kids beside Red Holocaust and Stalin. Be serious!!!!!"" (by nazratst from Romania)10 ""The infamous village massacre happens in the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film, and the German soldiers look so ridiculously evil and cartoon-like that it's very hard for this scene to have any particular interest or emotion. To be honest, I was so bored up to this point that the barbaric events unfolding on screen before me were almost welcoming as at least something was finally happening"". (by JSwallowX1 from Ireland)So, we can sum it all up in the lines below (adding some groovy spice will also help).Being a piece of blunt Soviet propaganda, the film is devoid of any historical accuracy and artistic merit. It's dull and tedious with an uninteresting main character (who has absolutely no background and is free from any development – either physical or mental). Who cares about some kid during the war times? Give us a HERO, not a whimpering child! This ""war"" flick is neither entertaining nor serious. Its fictional happenings (women and children burnt in the barns by the Nazis? come on, in reality it was vice versa! read the historical documents!) pump up to the levels of ""Star Wars"" with one serious difference: ""Star Wars"" was at least thought-provoking and shocking. There is no decent music in the movie at all and the whole soundtrack cries out to get turned off. The last straw that could break any camel's back (i.e. insult any viewer's ears) was some cheap melody at the end of the flick. The whole movie is boring to such degree that any normal human being will yawn and fall asleep during the initial 10 minutes. If you want to see a real feat for the eyes and ears, watch the documentary ""Der Ewige Jude"", which IS a masterpiece at all levels and on top of everything has realistic cow scenes (unlike this one). Watch any USA picture with the WWII topic – they are not many, but at least they represent the historical facts and show us WHO won the World War II and at WHAT unspeakable price... The Russians exaggerate things immensely, making the events going on on their territory look like some kind of annihilation. Nonsense. The Germans were never cruel during the WWII on the USSR territory and they always behaved in a most decent manner. It was Russian troops who were deranged killers (there is even a historically accurate photo of a Russian soldier bullying a poor German woman and robbing her of her bicycle! and it happened in the streets of Berlin when the war was over! Check out the I-net archive footage if you don't believe! just imagine WHAT was happening during the war days!). The verdict: if you are a sane civilized and thinking European, stay far away from this schmoopy fantasy.Do You agree? What do You know about the WWII? How empty is Your vision? To which extent are Your brains brainwashed and ""freed""?Any further comment is superfluous. Actually, this movie does not need any review or comment. But our today's way of life needs it badly.

10.0,"""You didn't know it would turn out like this, did you?""","It's probably a good thing that we have movies like this that show the brutality and evil of war, but I don't know if the mass of humanity ever learns from them. In recent days I've watched this movie and ""The Battle of Algiers"", and if you look at present day headlines and follow news of terrorism around the world, one must concede that the aggressive use of force is a distinct part of Man's nature. This is a viscerally disturbing film to watch, with scene after scene of intense brutality that would render a normal person who experienced it dysfunctional and mentally unhinged from reality.It's those utterly insane things that young Florya Gaishun (Aleksey Kravchenko) experiences after he quite enthusiastically joins the war effort against the Nazis in his home country of Byelorussia. The most disturbing scene for this viewer occurred when the German soldiers herded the citizens of Perekhody into a barn and set it on fire. A rationale offered later by a young captured German soldier reflected a hideous ideology, that all Russians needed to be exterminated and children had to die because 'the trouble starts with them'. To claim that this warped Nazi thinking belonged to butchers is an understatement; that's too kind a word to apply to the monsters that they were.I'm appreciative for having watched this movie, it's story and images will remain with me a long time. Some consider it the greatest war movie of all time, and though I would disagree, I would point to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" as another film with a similar emotional impact and rates a similar rating to this one on IMDb, the point of difference being that 'All Quiet' was made in 1930 and relates the horror that took place during World War I. Both films ought to be a timely reminder that war is hell, and can turn one's life into something unimaginable in an instant.",you didnt know it would turn out like this did you,its probably good thing that we have movies like this that show brutality evil war but i dont know if mass humanity ever learns them recent days ive watched this movie battle algiers if you look at present day headlines follow news terrorism around world one must concede that aggressive use force is distinct part mans nature this is viscerally disturbing film watch with scene after scene intense brutality that would render normal person who experienced it dysfunctional mentally unhinged reality its those utterly insane things that young florya gaishun aleksey kravchenko experiences after he quite enthusiastically joins war effort against nazis his home country byelorussia most disturbing scene this viewer occurred when german soldiers herded citizens perekhody into barn set it fire rationale offered later by young captured german soldier reflected hideous ideology that all russians needed be exterminated children had die because trouble starts with them claim that this warped nazi thinking belonged butchers is understatement thats too kind word apply monsters that they were im appreciative having watched this movie its story images will remain with me long time some consider it greatest war movie all time though i would disagree i would point all quiet western front as another film with similar emotional impact rates similar rating this one imdb point difference being that all quiet was made 1930 relates horror that took place during world war i both films ought be timely reminder that war is hell can turn ones life into something unimaginable instant,0.4994444444444445,0.056666666666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"

This is simply one of the few times where even if the film had had a different aspect ratio other than 1.33 (tv shape) I would rally to have it full screen rather than letterbox simply because for this movie you MUST lose yourself in what you see and hear. Having someone facing you, looking at you is more powerful when all you can see is their face. Faces are a landscape in this film.This is especially true of Floyra, our hero who's stunned expression at all that happens around him is a constant source of wonderment.As we as shocked and rattled by what we see we know that he is even more rattled because he is there and he is expressing it on his face. Its said he was hypnotized to be able to get the right expressions, and seeing the pain on his face I believe it since you could only express what he is by living through it... Wide eyed numbness his mouth sometimes agape we watch as he tries to just get on...The film as I said is subjective and we see and hear, literally, what Floyra does. When his hearing is thrown askew by shelling what we hear becomes less distinct. Sound will drift in and out and we get a sense of being there. The camera also holds on some scenes at times Not cutting away for better angles simply because Floyra doesn't have them.This film will rock your world and then some.I want to tell you everything about the film but at the same time fear that doing so will set up expectations as to what happens. Reading the material on the film and seeing the trailer set up some expectations in my mind, some of which was right and some was wrong. I would like to have you see the film knowing as little about what actually happens as possible so you experience the film straight. I lost my expectations the minute the film began and I was wondering what was going on... I was hooked as the long strange trip took over. I'm certain that once the film stats you will be free of expectations too but, at the same time I think if I told you too much it would ruin the what happens next.This is GREAT film making.That said there are two small flaws.First, as some reviews have said the Germans, when they finally show up on screen are just a tad cartoony. menacing but slightly cartoonish...I could be wrong... but regardless through it all Floyra's pained expression cuts the cartoon away and reminds us this is bad stuff going down.The second flaw is a montage of actual footage used near the very end. I know why it was done, or can guess, but its too long. It breaks the spell in some ways... I think it would have been more apt had the film had the original desired title of ""Kill Hitler"".The last point I want to make is the fact the film is on two DVDs. Released two years ago there is no logical reason for the film to be broken into two parts, the tape is a single cassette release, except that like many films from the Russian Film Council its loaded with subtitles, 13 languages and three audio options. There is also other extras like an introduction by the film maker that runs 20 minutes, documentary footage and an interview with the lead actor. But I digress....I'm certain that the film doesn't really need to be in two parts for any reason other than a technical one... except that in a strange way the break sort of works for the film if you watch it straight through taking only a break to switch discs. Call me crazy but the break is perfectly placed at the mid point to the story. Not only that the film changes from first half to second half. The tone , even though continuous in action, is different as the second disc begins. Its almost as if we are back at the beginning of the film at a peak that slowly slides downward. Time wise the two halves are different with the action taking place over a couple of jumbled days while the second is one continuous series of events over two days.In the end all that matters is the film.And here the film is absolutely great.See it and be moved.----------------------------------- random thoughts In its way its comparable to grave of fireflies The film that many people compare it to, Destiny of a Man, is a relation but not direct ancestor of it simply because the films are very different, Destiny taking place over years in Flashback, Come and See is happening here and now over weeks. They share themes and elements but the thrust and points are different, especially in the end...",one greatest war films ever made,i needed have two hours twenty odd minutes watch this with out interruption i didnt want break it any real reason or any real length time other than change disc more that later i had time so i watched movie i could argue that with two small flaws this is one greatest anti war films ever made this is subjective story boy who joins partisans during german invasion russian his decent into hell this is tough movie its your face everyone elses literally as we see everyone everything that our hero does even point that if hes talking someone camera will hold them as they speak with no cut aways we learn everything about people by their faces since we have time study them this is simply one few times where even if film had had different aspect ratio other than 1 33 tv shape i would rally have it full screen rather than letterbox simply because this movie you must lose yourself what you see hear having someone facing you looking at you is more powerful when all you can see is their face faces are landscape this film this is especially true floyra our hero whos stunned expression at all that happens around him is constant source wonderment as we as shocked rattled by what we see we know that he is even more rattled because he is there he is expressing it his face its said he was hypnotized be able get right expressions seeing pain his face i believe it since you could only express what he is by living through it wide eyed numbness his mouth sometimes agape we watch as he tries just get film as i said is subjective we see hear literally what floyra does when his hearing is thrown askew by shelling what we hear becomes less distinct sound will drift out we get sense being there camera also holds some scenes at times not cutting away better angles simply because floyra doesnt have them this film will rock your world then some i want tell you everything about film but at same time fear that doing so will set up expectations as what happens reading material film seeing trailer set up some expectations my mind some which was right some was wrong i would like have you see film knowing as little about what actually happens as possible so you experience film straight i lost my expectations minute film began i was wondering what was going i was hooked as long strange trip took over im certain that once film stats you will be free expectations too but at same time i think if i told you too much it would ruin what happens next this is great film making that said there are two small flaws first as some reviews have said germans when they finally show up screen are just tad cartoony menacing but slightly cartoonish i could be wrong but regardless through it all floyras pained expression cuts cartoon away reminds us this is bad stuff going down second flaw is montage actual footage used near very end i know why it was done or can guess but its too long it breaks spell some ways i think it would have been more apt had film had original desired title kill hitler last point i want make is fact film is two dvds released two years ago there is no logical reason film be broken into two parts tape is single cassette release except that like many films russian film council its loaded with subtitles 13 languages three audio options there is also other extras like introduction by film maker that runs 20 minutes documentary footage interview with lead actor but i digress im certain that film doesnt really need be two parts any reason other than technical one except that strange way break sort works film if you watch it straight through taking only break switch discs call me crazy but break is perfectly placed at mid point story not only that film changes first half second half tone even though continuous action is different as second disc begins its almost as if we are back at beginning film at peak that slowly slides downward time wise two halves are different with action taking place over couple jumbled days while second is one continuous series events over two days end all that matters is film here film is absolutely great see it be moved random thoughts its way its comparable grave fireflies film that many people compare it destiny man is relation but not direct ancestor it simply because films are very different destiny taking place over years flashback come see is happening here now over weeks they share themes elements but thrust points are different especially end,0.4490836272780716,0.07111074368018812,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,Harrowingly realistic; the true horrors of war,"Russian director Elem Klimov's final film, 'Idi i smotri {Come and See},' is a masterpiece of the genre, a war film so disturbingly intense that it strays into the realms of psychological horror. Set in 1943, during the Nazi occupation of Belarus, the film follows the fate of a young boy, Florya Gaishun (Aleksei Kravchenko), who joins the Soviet partisan army. As the horrors of war unfold before him, Florya loses his idealistic preconceptions of combat, becoming confused and psychologically unstable. The entire film is witnessed through his young eyes, as his civilised world is thrown into turmoil and those that he loves perish at the hands of a merciless enemy.Much like Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now,' the film is almost surrealistic in its exploration of the horrors of war, constructing a hallucinatory nightmare of escalating confusion, fear, death and madness. And yet, despite this, the film manages to come across as being frighteningly realistic. Perhaps this surrealistic approach is also, paradoxically, the most realistic depiction of war. Young Florya is cast into a hellish world he simply can't comprehend; placed in the same position, I imagine, the experience would strike us as being one long, distressing and horrible dream. Florya seemingly even treats it all as such. With the ghastly events happening all about him, he can do nothing but stare with petrified shock and awe, as one who expects to wake up at any moment.'Come and See' boasts a string of remarkable sequences which will resonate with viewers for a long time after they see it. A series of bomb strikes tear apart a Russian forest, silently obliterating the mature trees as a shell-shocked Florya hears only the maddening ringing in his ears; Florya attempts to clamber through a thick, murky bog, feeling with each step as though he is getting nowhere; he awakens in the midst of a thick mist, his head resting on the carcass of a dead cow. Perhaps the most lasting scene is one in which an entire population of villagers is herded into a barn, and then consequently set alight. Words fail to describe the horror of watching the flaming barn doors still flapping wildly as the inhabitants fight with their last breaths to save themselves and their families. Meanwhile, Florya just stares, his blank, disbelieving expression infinitely more effective than any other actions would have been.Inexperienced teenager Aleksei Kravchenko is excellent in the lead role, which the director subsequently described as ""a very difficult role with extreme emotional states."" So arduous were the emotional burdens of the film that Klimov later expressed surprise and relief that young Kravchenko did not suffer any adverse psychological trauma during and after filming, which notably employed the use of live ammunition to maximise authenticity. His character is placed in situations that are, to us, simply impossible to fathom, and Florya reacts to these changes in his life with a sort of awed silence, sometimes anger. Young actress Olga Mironova, apparently in her only film role, plays a pivotal role as Glasha, whom Florya befriends in the early part of the film.The film ends with a simple but very disturbing montage of archive footage. As Florya attempts to symbolically destroy Adolf Hitler by firing bullets at his portrait, the black-and-white World War II footage rapidly rewinds: we see corpses at a concentration camp, a 1930s Nazi party rally, Hitler's services during World War I. As Florya fires more and more bullets, the images continue to reverse themselves, as though eradicating the history from existence. Finally, we arrive at a photograph of Adolf Hitler sitting on his mother's lap as a young baby. Unlike the Nazi savages who felt no remorse in torching entire villages to the ground, Florya cannot bring himself to symbolically murder this innocent child, even with the knowledge of the horrors he would later orchestrate. Is this morality the reason why wars are an inevitable consequence of human existence?Though the final reel does undoubtedly stray towards propaganda (the Russian citizens are clearly shown to possess superior morals to those of the evil, fiendish Germans), the entire film is executed so disturbingly perfectly that you are too engrossed in the spectacle to really notice at all. There is no clear resolution to the story. Of course, the valiant Soviets successfully triumph over the company of Nazis, but they then strike off for another confrontation. The War will go on forever, and Florya will never be given a reprieve from all the horrors he has witnessed. The original working title of the film had been ""Kill Hitler,"" not specifically referring to the infamous dictator, but with a more general meaning. As Klimov explains in the DVD preface to his film, he meant the title to suggest that we should kill the ""Hitler"" within ourselves, ""because we all have our demons in this or that measure."" However, after the title was deemed inappropriate, another was chosen from chapter 6 the Book of Revelations: ""...and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, ""Come and see!""""'Come and See' was the final film that Klimov ever directed. Having experienced World War II with his own eyes as a child, he felt that it was a film that he needed to make, and, after doing so, he was no longer compelled to continue directing. The director comments, once again on the DVD preface: ""I don't regret that I made that film. It had a difficult pre-history and history. But one has to make it a difference once in a while, to commit something worthy. Herein lies the sense of creative work, when you can offer to people something real serious, real meaningful"" Simply put, this is the masterpiece that he was born to make, and a single viewing will ultimately change the way that you view war.",harrowingly realistic true horrors war,russian director elem klimovs final film idi i smotri come see is masterpiece genre war film so disturbingly

10.0,a brief comment on some comments,"What most of the foreign viewers perhaps don't understand is that the factual side of the movie has always been a common knowledge among millions of Russians especially those of older generations. People like me, who were born 10-15 years after the war ended, knew it all along first hand from the stories told by parents and grandparents actually living through those times and events. My own mother at the age of seven was thrown by German soldiers into a barn that got lit, her front teeth were knocked out by the butt of a German soldier's rifle and she, along with tenth of other village kids, was saved by my grand-mother and other villagers only because some partisans had chosen to attack and deliberate the village that day. What most of Western viewers find horrifying, shocking and disturbing is nothing but the truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers. This movie is pretty much like a documentary that could actually be shot with the help of some sort of a ""time machine"" in case there was one in 1985 when the movie got filmed.",brief comment some comments,what most foreign viewers perhaps dont understand is that factual side movie has always been common knowledge among millions russians especially those older generations people like me who were born 10 15 years after war ended knew it all along first hand stories told by parents grandparents actually living through those times events my own mother at age seven was thrown by german soldiers into barn that got lit her front teeth were knocked out by butt german soldiers rifle she along with tenth other village kids was saved by my grand mother other villagers only because some partisans had chosen attack deliberate village that day what most western viewers find horrifying shocking disturbing is nothing but truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers this movie is pretty much like documentary that could actually be shot with help some sort time machine case there was one 1985 when movie got filmed,0.469551282051282,0.011217948717948725,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.24}"
