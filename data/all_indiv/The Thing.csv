10.0,A classic that still holds up to this very day,"""I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.""John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made  fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission, but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the ""dog"" is actually a shape-shifting alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims  in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural prison.""The Thing,"" the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic ""Alien"" (1979). Many comparisons have been made  the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one-by-one. However, ""The Thing""  for all practical purposes  came first.Based on the famous short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was ""The Thing From Another World,"" an unarguable classic. But to be fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly. From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time, ""The Thing""  by any standards  is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, ""The Thing"" performed poorly in theaters, and ""E.T.""  released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien  became the higher-grossing picture of the two (by far).In the long run, however, ""The Thing"" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th Anniversary Re-Release. ""The Thing,"" on the other hand, has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics  it is one of the most famous non-famous movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career  from his amazing ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (1976) to the magnificent ""Halloween"" (1978) to the disappointing and silly ""Escape from L.A."" (1996), ""The Thing"" remains his very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most ""great movies"" lists, ""The Thing"" is still one of my favorite horror films, and  upon close inspection  masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling  a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is genuinely unpredictable.",classic that still holds up this very day,i know im human if you were all these things then youd just attack me right now so some you are still human this thing doesnt want show itself it wants hide inside imitation itll fight if it has but its vulnerable out open if it takes us over then it has no more enemies nobody left kill it then its won john carpenters thing is one most entertaining horror films ever made fast clever purely exciting start finish this is how all movies genre should be made taking place antarctic 1982 movie focuses specifically group american scientists we are given no introduction their mission but are thrust into their existence when pair seemingly crazy norwegians appears at their base camp chasing escaped dog norwegians are killed dog finds its way into colony which is when things really start get crazy it is soon made quite clear that dog is actually shape shifting alien organism which manifests itself upon physical form its victims other words it begins eat americans imitate them so well that remaining humans cannot discern difference between their friends enemiesthe pack scientists led by macready kurt russell begin fight their own survival using wits instead brawn if thing is indeed amongst them then how are they go about revealing it how many things are there how can thing be killed or can it be destroyed at all creatures origins film are explained easily thirty thousand years ago spacecraft plummeted earth was frozen antarctic ice thing tried escape was discovered ice by norwegians who unknowingly released it its natural prison thing movie itself is similar ridley scotts iconic alien 1979 many comparisons have been made protagonists are stranded desolate area stalked by seldom seen foe that manages kill them off one by one however thing all practical purposes came first based famous short story who goes there by john w campbell jr writing under pseudonym as don stuart film was originally adapted as feature production 1951 by howard hawks christian nyby result was thing another world unarguable classic but be fair it bore little resemblance short story carpenters remake does it more justice idea thing being able adapt physicality anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great is most vital link short story 1951 special effects were simply too poor reasonably portray shape shifting organism but thirty one years brought many advances sfx creature effects artist rob bottin does excellent job turning what could have easily become cheesy gore fest into startlingly frightening realistic mess blood fear thing although never actually taking one specific form is constantly seen morphing stage effects are simply superb they still pack punch twenty two years later ennio morricones score nominated razzie award at time is bit too electronic tinny but nevertheless haunting when used correctly fact that its cast consists entirely males fact that its ending is one most thought provoking untypical conclusions all time thing by any standards is unconventional hollywood at its best it comes as no surprise that at time its release thing performed poorly theaters e t released same year featuring much kinder alien became higher grossing picture two by far long run however thing is superior almost every conceivable way spielbergs tale is outdated flopped during its 20th anniversary re release thing other hand has gradually climbed ladder cult classics it is one most famous non famous movies ever made carpenter is notorious having very uneven career his amazing assault precinct 13 1976 magnificent halloween 1978 disappointing silly escape l 1996 thing remains his very best motion picture although its reputation over years has never been honorary enough land it spot most great movies lists thing is still one my favorite horror films upon close inspection masterfully crafted it is daring ingenious thrill ride that is simultaneously unique chilling genuine relief film buffs who are tired same old horror knock offs this one at very least is genuinely unpredictable,0.5240768194070082,0.14069519317160822,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,"""The Thing"" is John Carpenter's masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!","A classic film. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of ""The Thing's"" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see ""The Thing"" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?""Trust is a tough thing to come by these days."" John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone!

10.0,Flips the scenario round from the original to great effect.,"John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a ""what is in the shadow"" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and see what happens indeed. 10/10",flips scenario round original great effect,john carpenter shows how much he loves 1951 original by giving it utmost respect that he possibly could only difference here is that carpenter chooses stick paranoiac core john w campbell jrs short story secret this versions success is unbearable tension that builds up as group men become suspicious each other strain literally waiting be taken over takes fearful hold carpenter then manages deliver shocks as well as mystery thats needed keep film heading right direction be it horrific scene or what is shadow sequence film is perfect fusion horror sci fi dialogue is laced with potency viability group men trying keep it together under such duress while ennio morricones score is wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up sense doom paranoia seaming throughout film cast are superb solid assembly line actors led by carpenter favourite kurt russell whilst effects used around characters get right amount impact needed but most all its ending that is crowning glory ending that doesnt pander norm is incredibly fitting what has gone before it lets wait see what happens indeed 10 10,0.6415178571428571,0.1456845238095238,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,"Right up there with ""Halloween""--one of Carpenter's best!","Remake of the classic 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette ""Who Goes There?"") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with ""E.T."" and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms.

9.0,Today it's still one of the best horror films,"Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!",today its still one best horror films,antarctica winter 1982 team american research base get surprised by couple mad norwegians who is chasing dog with helicopter trying kill it all norwegians are killed americans are left with nothing but dog couple bodies questions thats beginning greatest horror thriller film ive ever seen very beginning all end you feel tense paranoid mood helpless alone out no mans land ennio morricone was nominated razzie award his score why i dont know cause as far as i can see his score is simple creepy very good it really gets you right mood acting is great best performance is probably given by dog whos just amazing as russell others two legs i can say nothing less you may think 1982 special effects are not most impressive well think again you havent seen it all until youve seen this bodyparts falling off creatures changing forms rob bottin has done great job witch today stands as milestone is special effects makeup movie didnt get big response when it first hit big screen due other alien films at time so its not very well known fact you can almost consider it unknown movie nobody ive asked have heard it however movie has managed survive over twenty years as cult film video dvd twenty years is long time except haircut movie is still pretty much up date this movie is be considered classic movie is without doubt one my if not my favorite ive seen it several times but its just as good as first time i saw it as norwegian only thing i dont like about this movie is that macready keeps calling norwegians swedes,0.49808441558441563,0.168219696969697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Intelligent Splatter,"This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession.

Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween.

,Good things come to those who wait,"* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5) The Thing Directed by: John Carpenter, 1982 Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing  today a highly treasured cult favourite  one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982. Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared  moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story ""Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast. It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday. This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history. Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery. A satisfying example of a movie that today  18 years after  looks downright muscular in its simplicity. The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely. Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned  there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form. Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every way. The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).

10.0,I worship this film. 10/10,"John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great? It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place. The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell. The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.

10.0,Still my all time favorite sci-fi/horror!!!,"The silly saying, ""You can't touch this"" surely applies here. With all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine cast.

10.0,A creepy gem of imaginative sci-fi horror,"Although this film clearly got made due to the success of ALIEN, I actually find it the better of the two. I certainly consider it Carpenter's joint best, along with that one with the Michael Myers guy. This is a film based on John W. Campbell's story ""Who Goes There?"", which also inspired the 1951 flick THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which saw James Arness as a killer carrot-man in the same setting. Carpenter is closer to the original story, as his menace is a gory shape shifting alien which consumes and imitates its prey – forget the T1000, he has nothing on this thing. The look of the creature is extremely disgusting and disturbing and hard to forget – imagine some Lovecraftian terror in the flesh, covered in blood and tentacles and other less describable body parts, and you're halfway there.The rest of the special effects are incredible; witness heads slide off bodies and turn into spiders, and the infamous and gut-wrenching kennel transformation which I had the misfortune to watch when I was but a boy. You can bet I had plenty of sleepless nights after watching that one. Plenty of blood, gore, and violence throughout make this one of the hardest of horrors. Yet despite all the effects, this is still a plot-driven movie with absolutely loads of suspense and tension – not to mention a near overwhelming paranoia throughout.There are many imaginative moments – the opening sequence, in which Norbert Weisser tries to kill a poor little doggie – to the excellent blood test scene, in which the guys are tied down whilst Russell tests their blood samples for the alien virus. Russell is subdued but great and as an ensemble, the rest of the guys are true to life and so believable, which makes it all the more horrific. Every outburst, crack-up or breakdown seems to be happening for real and we do learn to care about these very natural researchers trapped in the worst scenario imaginable. Add to this a spooky Morricone score and you have a super movie about which I can say no more – except that you watch it for yourself.",creepy gem imaginative sci fi horror,although this film clearly got made due success alien i actually find it better two i certainly consider it carpenters joint best along with that one with michael myers guy this is film based john w campbells story who goes there which also inspired 1951 flick thing another world which saw james arness as killer carrot man same setting carpenter is closer original story as his menace is gory shape shifting alien which consumes imitates its prey forget t1000 he has nothing this thing look creature is extremely disgusting disturbing hard forget imagine some lovecraftian terror flesh covered blood tentacles other less describable body parts youre halfway there rest special effects are incredible witness heads slide off bodies turn into spiders infamous gut wrenching kennel transformation which i had misfortune watch when i was but boy you can bet i had plenty sleepless nights after watching that one plenty blood gore violence throughout make this one hardest horrors yet despite all effects this is still plot driven movie with absolutely loads suspense tension not mention near overwhelming paranoia throughout there are many imaginative moments opening sequence which norbert weisser tries kill poor little doggie excellent blood test scene which guys are tied down whilst russell tests their blood samples alien virus russell is subdued but great as ensemble rest guys are true life so believable which makes it all more horrific every outburst crack up or breakdown seems be happening real we do learn care about these very natural researchers trapped worst scenario imaginable add this spooky morricone score you have super movie about which i can say no more except that you watch it yourself,0.5905699855699855,0.05246302308802311,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"

Naturally, being a teen, I was reluctant to give anything from the 80s a try as I felt it to be a long gone ancient era. I was pleasantly surprised. The practical effects were a very welcome change to the cgi I was used to. They were done so well that I was at no point removed from the illusion. To this day, they're still the best I've seen. It's proof that if done right, practical effects such as animatronics will always beat out cgi.The movie is fantastic in every way. Kurt Russell is such a good actor that I'd have to class him as one of my favorites.

10.0,The last John Carpenter classic,"In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien. And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received.

10.0,A serious contender for the best remake ever,"The Thing is not only a brilliant remake(which I was not expecting after seeing abominations such as Psycho and The Wicker Man) but it is also a brilliant film that seamlessly blends horror and sci-fi amongst other things.The atmosphere is especially what makes the movie so good. To this day, very few other movies have shocked, haunted or unnerved me as much as The Thing. The scenery, sets and costumes are eye-popping and the effects are brilliantly designed and suitably grotesque without distracting too much.There is also Ennio Morricone's most haunting score, a cracking script and a deliberately slow-paced but compelling story that is quite ahead of its time. Not to mention wonderful direction and credible and well-written characters. The acting is equally great, in my mind Kurt Russell has never been better, likewise with Keith David and Wilford Brimley has brilliant delivery of the lines.All in all, a brilliant film and one essentials and its genre(s). 10/10 Bethany Cox",serious contender best remake ever,thing is not only brilliant remake which i was not expecting after seeing abominations such as psycho wicker man but it is also brilliant film that seamlessly blends horror sci fi amongst other things atmosphere is especially what makes movie so good this day very few other movies have shocked haunted or unnerved me as much as thing scenery sets costumes are eye popping effects are brilliantly designed suitably grotesque without distracting too much there is also ennio morricones most haunting score cracking script deliberately slow paced but compelling story that is quite ahead its time not mention wonderful direction credible well written characters acting is equally great my mind kurt russell has never been better likewise with keith david wilford brimley has brilliant delivery lines all all brilliant film one essentials its genre s 10 10 bethany cox,0.618395061728395,0.28913580246913584,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.1}"
,"A Timeless Look in Paranoia, a Horror Classic","Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI, blue screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan of John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In 'The Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well. The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror. If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great. Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye",timeless look paranoia horror classic,just put things perspective you before i get into my thoughts this film i am only 20 years old have grown up era cgi blue screen effects this movie was made around same time i was born with that said wow i only recently saw john carpenters version thing what masterpiece it truly is i have long since been fan john carpenter particular his works late 70s 80s thing john carpenter has truly crafted paranoia inducing perhaps gut wrenching classic movie is update classic thing outer space but only like its predecessor this film is full color characters this film have much more worry about than alien veggiethe film centers around group arctic researchers you encounter alien lifeform capable taking form anything it comes into contact with out that matter kurt russell stars as r j macready alcoholic vietnam vet thrust into role leader group relatively cold callous men all whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against creature that can take any form be any one them john carpenter more than any other his films manages create truly believable incredible atmosphere when watching this film you truly get sense dark sinister desolate surroundings you feel realize that these characters have no where go never one second do you not believe they are stuck polar ice cap also this film has perhaps one greatest endings any film its genre or any genre that matter im not going give it away here but say that it will leave you wondering would be understatement kurt russell is superb as macready truly conveying emotions man thrust into situation unimaginable horror forced lead group men who cannot trust that man next them is not creature that has driven them brink paranoia emotional meltdown i dont care if this movie is 20 years old by now special effects this movie are gut wrenching mind blowing absolutely awesome they blow away any cgi pixel based crap out there today thing itself is truly horrifying disturbing creation unlike any alien you have ever seen movie before those who have low tolerance gore blood had best prepare themselves watching this movie this movie does what any good horror sci fi movie should do it really thrusts you into its characters world it leaves you wondering what would you do who could you trust if anyone you knew could be creature waiting feed you take you over as well images ideals this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it today as i write this review send chill up my spine it is true shame this movie is only now getting proper recognition it deserves box office flop when released now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot one dimensional effects this film can be appreciated as true masterpiece sci fi horror if possible get collectors edition dvd enjoy it anamorphic widescreen way it is truly meant be seen marvel at incredible scenery taught direction excellent atmosphere sweat inducing gag reflex activating everything else that makes this movie great watch it with lights out with group close friends maybe even with dog around if you dont what im talking about you will afterwards dont let classic pass you bye,0.5517174082747853,0.13987119437939113,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,The tagline is no mere jest,"""The ultimate in alien terror,"" it says. It's not wrong. This is it. This is the greatest horror film ever made. John Carpenter's A-#1.Cinema is full of great creature designs, yet The Thing bests them all. Every incarnation we see of the creature, and all the practical effects and set pieces that bring it to life, are the best that the industry has to offer. The most realistic CGI will never compete.The paranoia and distrust in the outpost is palpable. Carpenter crafts a tangible atmosphere of desperation and suspicion, from the unassuming beginning to the classic, ambiguous end--one of my very favorite endings from any movie, ever.Composer extraordinaire Ennio Morricone lends his great skills with a minimalist, synth-driven score that adds immensely to the building unease. It very well complements the performances of the excellent ensemble cast that bring every feeling of terror and wariness to life. Kurt Russell once again shines as Carpenter's lead, MacReady, and Keith David is superb as the antagonistic Childs. It's easy to overlook other cast members with smaller roles and less time on screen--even the unmistakable Wilford Brimley--but have no doubt, they're all just as good, just as essential to the picture.Once again: not only is John Carpenter a master storyteller, a fantastic director generally, but his greatest skill is in slowly building the tension and suspense in his pictures until the explosive finale. He does it so well that it's impossible for the viewer not to experience the same misgivings, the same sense of horror, as the characters on-screen--not because you're watching it, but because you FEEL it just as deeply.It's violent, it's gory, and broadly it may not be for everyone. But this needs to be seen by anyone with the slightest interest in horror, or creature features, or with a keen interest in cinema history as a whole.

10.0,"One of the best horror movies ever, finally getting recognition.","If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, ""The Thing"" really gives ""Alien"" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his creative powers (although I consider ""Starman"" to be even better, but this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a would-be apocalypse unlike any""thing"" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how ""The Thing"" was doing on the IMDb scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now, it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason: It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that. Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in ""Predator"") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing, claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team, once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down, but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is nemesis for a horror movie and ""The Thing"" is living proof that if you plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.",one best horror movies ever finally getting recognition,if you re not reading this comment just feel assured that there are other people this world who share your good taste films do yourself favor watch this movie immediately this would have probably been best horror movie ever if it wasnt ridley scotts masterpiece alien but i would say thing really gives alien run its money we are talking about cream crop horror sci fi category it also easily qualifies as one best movies ever regardless genre john carpenter is master horror movie making here we find him at pinnacle his creative powers although i consider starman be even better but this isnt horror film its another story top notch performances all male cast across board grade screen writing stunning visuals cinematography course carpenters impeccable direction combine into spellbinding nightmarish tale would be apocalypse unlike any thing you have seen before when i first checked see how thing was doing imdb scoreboard back 2001 i was disappointed see it was hovering somewhere about 5 9 6 0 most comments where not very good either with few exceptions i was more than pleased see this movie gaining more more appreciation over years as i see now it is among top 250 with score above 8 0 with good reason it is certainly one greatest horror movies history which went under radar many years until it finally achieved cult status it deserved first place i was about 9 year old when i first watched this movie late at night tv perfect conditions age group watch film like that needless say i was scared death it took long time until i watched it again but way i could remember all key scenes was sign profound impact it had me as kid right haunting title sequence which i think was later also copied predator spectacular gore scenes chilling sense isolation impending doom created by gloomy score since then i have re watched it many many times i have admit it is perfect material repeated viewing more than quarter century after its first failed release witnessing quality what was supposed be b movie 80s really puts most films shot today shame detail attention that went into production design is truly amazing whole antarctic environment is replicated with tremendous accuracy you can feel cold isolation this barren white wasteland where story is taking place this is pivotal creating menacing paranoia inducing claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates film start finish story itself is quite unconventional based acclaimed novella 1938 team scientists stationed antarctica face alien life form found buried ice which upon thawed has ability consume other living organisms including people imitate them perfectly film concentrates around fear mistrust communication breakdown that ensues between members team once they realize they are isolated outside world unable get help with one or more them possibly not being human way dynamics team is presented realistic depiction their reactions makes movie transcend its original premise as just horror sci fi film become something much deeper profound i am always amazed by realistic behavior each member despite unrealistic setup you see people be afraid some even break down but you dont get you regular unstable guy who freaks out tries kill everybody kurt russel gives career making performance while rest cast also does excellent job all around terrific ensemble piece there is also large amount carefully timed quality gore that is utterly mind blowing rob bottin man mainly responsible animatronic although also stan winston was also involved animatronic work make up redefined state art what was possible producing some best gore sequences ever that remain unmatched even today whats more these effects are really terrifying because they look feel real life like cgi is nemesis horror movie thing is living proof that if you plan shoot even remotely scary scene make sure you stick good old latex makeup special mention should also go ennio moriccones haunting score i cant believe it was actually nominated razzie morricone produced some extremely effective underscore suspense building scenes film communicating all paranoia isolated team otherworldly alien presence that lurks dark places waiting take hold overall i cannot recommend this movie more strongly it is rare combination unparalleled atmosphere unconventional story inspired visuals which has stood test time admirably,0.5864729660846164,0.1824107661486302,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8.0,Makes more sense now,"This movie failed at the box office and nearly ruined the career of John Carpenter. Think of that as you watch it. But did it really fail? It made nearly $20 million on a $15 million budget, but audiences must have expected more. Studios certainly did.Was it because E.T. came out at the same time, as well as so many other science fiction and fantasy films? Did the recession make people not want to watch something so nihilistic? Did the sheer level of gore turn people off? Were people upset that he remade a film some considered a classic*?After one market research screening, Carpenter asked the audience what they thought. One answered, ""Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing...?"" When Carpenter said that the answer was up to their imagination, the response was, ""Oh, God. I hate that.""How could audiences respond to a movie that did not spoon feed them any of the story beats? That doesn't have a single character to root for or get behind? That is influenced by Lovecraft - as our the other Apocalypse Trilogy installments Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness - in that ordinary people face off with supernatural horror that they are doomed to be destroyed by, which isn't really what mainstream America wants from a popcorn film?Yeah, it could be all of those things. Or perhaps, the world was not ready for it. But watching the end of this film, as everyone sits around wondering who has a disease that they can barely understand and know will eventually impact them, yeah. I think the world of 2020 is ready for it.I wonder what it's like to watch this movie when it screens every year at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. I bet it feels pretty real there, too.In an interview with the AV Club, Carpenter said, ""If The Thing had been a hit, my career would have been different. I wouldn't have had to make the choices that I made. But I needed a job. I'm not saying I hate the movies I did. I loved making Christine and Starman and Big Trouble in Little China, all those films. But my career would have been different.""As it was, Carpenter was reluctant to make the film** and nearly quit before it ever started filming. A lifelong fan of Howard Hawks***, he felt that his version of the story - both are based on Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr. - was unbeatable. But as he re-read the original story - spurred on by co-producer Stuart Cohen - he saw how he could make a movie with a vision for his time, just as Hawks had thirty years ago.Beyond Carpenter, so many talents make this film work. Of course, there are the actors on screen, like Kurt Russell, Keith David, T.K. Carter, Wilfred Brimley, David Clennon and Richard Dysart. But there's also the astounding production design and storyboards from Man-Thing artist Mike Ploog and Mentor Huebner, which were so detailed that several of the shots from this look like carbon copies of their sketches. There's Dean Cundy working to make every shot look amazing - this is his first major studio movie with Carpenter. Want it to get even better? Sure, Carpenter could have done the score, but he got Ennio Morricone****. And finally, the Rob Bottin-lef effects team were pushed to the brink of exhaustion - Bottin was only 21 years old and ended up going to the hospital for exhaustion, double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer after working for an entire year on the film, sleeping on set - but the work they created will never be duplicated and puts any CGI efforts to remake this film to shame. Carpenter thought that having someone in a suit - like Alien - cheapened the film. He wanted something more. Well, he got it. In the last battle with the Thing, fifty different artists are operating the monster.We're lucky that this movie exists. I saw it at the drive-in this year and it felt like it could have been made today. It was too imaginative, too nihilistic and too good for most people, even nearly forty years later.*One of the reviews that upset Carpenter the most came from the co-director of the original, Christian Nyby, said, ""If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse. All in all, it's a terrific commercial for J&B Scotch.""**Originally, Universal was going with Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel as the team for this movie, but were unhappy with their take. John Landis was also considered, but the film was really greenlit when Alien was such a big deal in 1979.***How big of a fan is Carpenter? You can see scenes of The Thing from Another World during Halloween.****Morricone's score for this film was nominated for a Razzie, while his score for The Hateful Eight - which has some unused music from this film in it - won him his only Best Original Score Oscar.",makes more sense now,this movie failed at box office nearly ruined career john carpenter think that as you watch it but did it really fail it made nearly 20 million 15 million budget but audiences must have expected more studios certainly did was it because e t came out at same time as well as so many other science fiction fantasy films did recession make people not want watch something so nihilistic did sheer level gore turn people off were people upset that he remade film some considered classic after one market research screening carpenter asked audience what they thought one answered well what happened very end which one was thing when carpenter said that answer was up their imagination response was oh god i hate that how could audiences respond movie that did not spoon feed them any story beats that doesnt have single character root or get behind that is influenced by lovecraft as our other apocalypse trilogy installments prince darkness mouth madness that ordinary people face off with supernatural horror that they are doomed be destroyed by which isnt really what mainstream america wants popcorn film yeah it could be all those things or perhaps world was not ready it but watching end this film as everyone sits around wondering who has disease that they can barely understand know will eventually impact them yeah i think world 2020 is ready it i wonder what its like watch this movie when it screens every year at amundsen scott south pole station i bet it feels pretty real there too interview with av club carpenter said if thing had been hit my career would have been different i wouldnt have had make choices that i made but i needed job im not saying i hate movies i did i loved making christine starman big trouble little china all those films but my career would have been different as it was carpenter was reluctant make film nearly quit before it ever started filming lifelong fan howard hawks he felt that his version story both are based who goes there by john w campbell jr was unbeatable but as he re read original story spurred by co producer stuart cohen he saw how he could make movie with vision his time just as hawks had thirty years ago beyond carpenter so many talents make this film work course there are actors screen like kurt russell keith david t k carter wilfred brimley david clennon richard dysart but theres also astounding production design storyboards man thing artist mike ploog mentor huebner which were so detailed that several shots this look like carbon copies their sketches theres dean cundy working make every shot look amazing this is his first major studio movie with carpenter want it get even better sure carpenter could have done score but he got ennio morricone finally rob bottin lef effects team were pushed brink exhaustion bottin was only 21 years old ended up going hospital exhaustion double pneumonia bleeding ulcer after working entire year film sleeping set but work they created will never be duplicated puts any cgi efforts remake this film shame carpenter thought that having someone suit like alien cheapened film he wanted something more well he got it last battle with thing fifty different artists are operating monster were lucky that this movie exists i saw it at drive this year it felt like it could have been made today it was too imaginative too nihilistic too good most people even nearly forty years later one reviews that upset carpenter most came co director original christian nyby said if you want blood go slaughterhouse all all its terrific commercial j b scotch originally universal was going with tobe hooper kim henkel as team this movie but were unhappy with their take john landis was also considered but film was really greenlit when alien was such big deal 1979 how big fan is carpenter you can see scenes thing another world during halloween morricones score this film was nominated razzie while his score hateful eight which has some unused music this film it won him his only best original score oscar,0.48672723475355045,0.10604636591478697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,Masterful horror,"The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien. There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good, like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances should any child ever see this film.

Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature creations of Bottin are truly outstanding.

10.0,"the most professionally astute horror film of the 80's, very entertaining","In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without CGI.

10.0,An equal to Alien,"This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense. It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in. Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form  kind of  and is burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features some of the best special effects of its time  they have not dated a bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside, though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. ""Nobody trusts anybody"" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a 1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie!
