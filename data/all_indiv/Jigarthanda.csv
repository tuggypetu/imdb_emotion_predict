9,A refreshing Film!,"One of the finest commercial and a well made sensible movie in Tamil cinema. Rarely we see such good movies (last in Tamil being soodhu kavum).The movie starts off with a aspiring director (and family supports his ambition) being discouraged by a renowned director. As the movie goes on we get to know that a producer who had an ego clash with the renowned director agrees to produce our hero's film. Later we get to know the producer's words were just a gimmick for the public. The producer then sets a task for the hero asking him to take inspiration from gangster epics like Thalapathy, Nayagan, God Father, Scarface, etc and make prepare a script. The movie then shifts to Madurai where our hero follows a rustic and violent goon named sethu (assault sethu). Then the whole movie is about how the hero gets his script done, unfortunate serious problem in his movie and how he over comes it. First half is very fast paced and the second half drags a bit but the original screen play and the performance of the actors compensates for that. The star of the movie is the antagonist Simha who portrays assault Sethu. He carries the role with such a ease which is very commendable. His timing makes even a serious scene a bit comical intentionally. Let it be a scene in which he kills someone or let it be the scene in which he learns how to act, he just fills the scene with apt expressions. Siddarth as an aspiring director has done something that isn't his usual chocolate hero kind of role. He is good in his role and is obviously overshadowed by Simha easily. Lakshmi Menon's role is a kind of role which the audience would feel is unnecessary but in one scene she justifies the character and that changes the story flow altogether. The music director and cinematographer's work in this movie are remarkable. Their part in the creative output is as important as the directors. Karthik Subbaraj has proved that pizza wasn't just a one time brilliance. His movies will be awaited a lot more after this one. The only minute flaw is the running time of 170 minutes. But having said that the director manages to hold your attention in a neat manner. What starts to be a rags to riches story turns into a gangster movie which in turn turns into an amazing movie with thrills comedy and surprises filled ones. Such movies reinstate our faith in good cinema which shows skin n abuses and gore with mass heroes isn't really necessary to deliver a hit movie. In short the movie should not be missed and if u don't know the language then wait as this movie will surely be remade in many languages! Cheers to the Jigarthanda team. Thanks for making the film worth my money.",refreshing film,one finest commercial well made sensible movie tamil cinema rarely we see such good movies last tamil being soodhu kavum movie starts off with aspiring director family supports his ambition being discouraged by renowned director as movie goes we get know that producer who had ego clash with renowned director agrees produce our heros film later we get know producers words were just gimmick public producer then sets task hero asking him take inspiration gangster epics like thalapathy nayagan god father scarface etc make prepare script movie then shifts madurai where our hero follows rustic violent goon named sethu assault sethu then whole movie is about how hero gets his script done unfortunate serious problem his movie how he over comes it first half is very fast paced second half drags bit but original screen play performance actors compensates that star movie is antagonist simha who portrays assault sethu he carries role with such ease which is very commendable his timing makes even serious scene bit comical intentionally let it be scene which he kills someone or let it be scene which he learns how act he just fills scene with apt expressions siddarth as aspiring director has done something that isnt his usual chocolate hero kind role he is good his role is obviously overshadowed by simha easily lakshmi menons role is kind role which audience would feel is unnecessary but one scene she justifies character that changes story flow altogether music director cinematographers work this movie are remarkable their part creative output is as important as directors karthik subbaraj has proved that pizza wasnt just one time brilliance his movies will be awaited lot more after this one only minute flaw is running time 170 minutes but having said that director manages hold your attention neat manner what starts be rags riches story turns into gangster movie which turn turns into amazing movie with thrills comedy surprises filled ones such movies reinstate our faith good cinema which shows skin n abuses gore with mass heroes isnt really necessary deliver hit movie short movie should not be missed if u dont know language then wait as this movie will surely be remade many languages cheers jigarthanda team thanks making film worth my money,0.5974567901234569,0.1915185185185186,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.32}"

9,One of the rarest movie in Indian cinema and one of the finest actor in Inidan cinema,"The reason I watched this movie is for my favorite Bobby Simha and Karthick Subbaaraj. I stunned with the performance of Simha, he is really amazing and awesome. I am dare to say Simha is going to be finest actor in Indian cinema if he is continue to do the different character as he did so far. Even I am dare to suggest tamil old actors like Rajini, Kamal, Ajith, Vijay to learn what is real acting from Simha. Simha is really great great. Am damn sure he is one of the best actor in Indian cinema. Particularly I am mesmerized when he change over his acting from don to normal man and normal man to don, especially when he ask Siddarth with knife in his hand, ""pakathula vandhavudanae bayam poiduchaa"", this performance is epic. And another grooving performance is, when Simha receives credits from the child of Soundhar, Simha's eyes itself conveyed the movie climax, thats why director orchestrate all the dialogue in gibberish in the climax, only few actors can do that performance and only good movie lovers can understand what Simha is expressing. Apart from performance all credits goes to director. After Pizza the expectation was much higher on Jigarthanda. But after Jigarthanda what Karthick is going to do. lets wait and watch. Hope Kartick will come with another surprise in his next movie. But am damn sure, Karthick himself can not make flick like this again, it is a once in a life time script. I admire Karthick more than Bala, Manirathnam. Because Karthick is more intellectual director than them. And last credits goes to composer Santhosh and cinemotographer gavemic u ary. Hats off to them. Great work.",one rarest movie indian cinema one finest actor inidan cinema,reason i watched this movie is my favorite bobby simha karthick subbaaraj i stunned with performance simha he is really amazing awesome i am dare say simha is going be finest actor indian cinema if he is continue do different character as he did so far even i am dare suggest tamil old actors like rajini kamal ajith vijay learn what is real acting simha simha is really great great am damn sure he is one best actor indian cinema particularly i am mesmerized when he change over his acting don normal man normal man don especially when he ask siddarth with knife his hand pakathula vandhavudanae bayam poiduchaa this performance is epic another grooving performance is when simha receives credits child soundhar simhas eyes itself conveyed movie climax thats why director orchestrate all dialogue gibberish climax only few actors can do that performance only good movie lovers can understand what simha is expressing apart performance all credits goes director after pizza expectation was much higher jigarthanda but after jigarthanda what karthick is going do lets wait watch hope kartick will come with another surprise his next movie but am damn sure karthick himself can not make flick like this again it is once life time script i admire karthick more than bala manirathnam because karthick is more intellectual director than them last credits goes composer santhosh cinemotographer gavemic u ary hats off them great work,0.5768199233716476,0.3212643678160921,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10,The Magic which stays on throughout!!!Unarguably Tasty**Jigarthanda**,"When was the last time we were very very satisfied , wearing a big smile and always talking about a movie which we watched? To me it was ages and today i can say that a movie has lived and satisfied a wide section of people of the South. Jigarthanda!!!!!!The Magical drink of Madurai and now the magical movie of the South.Jigarthanda has promised on the above lines turning out to be a perfect treat to the audience who were looking for a good movie in the recent times. The Hype surrounding Karthik Subbaraj and his 2nd Outing was justified becoming one of the most anticipated movie of 2014 and featuring in the Forbes 5th most awaited movie.After Pizza, it was a revelation of Karthik Subbaraj having churned out this one. We there more and more words i would like to add in praise of KArthik and his movie but the verdict is already there. Jigarthanda is a blockbuster and an ultimate Winner.The Movie. Well No spoilers ahead. I want all of you to watch the movie in theatres !!!!An aspiring film maker wants to make a gangster movie and he lands in Madurai in search of an apt Gangster for his scripting. What happens when he crosses in with the most dreaded Gangster of Madurai forms the Crux of the movie. The Characters!!!! a lot to say about so may people who worked in this Movie.Bobby Simha: The True hero of Jigarthanda and i can confidently say no actor could have done ""Assault"" Sethu other than the 7 film Old Simha. Hats off to this young guy to have pulled out the role with Ease. Enjoyed each and every scene of his appearance in the movie and the mere presence of his in the film is more than enough to take the audience for an awesome ride, well this was always the case with our superstars of Kollywood but its Simha!!!The dialogue delivery and his body language speaks its all and he is sure to travel heights. Hats off to this Young Man.Karunakaran: We have a lot of comedians in Kollywood from the likes of Karunas , GAnja Karuppu to Santhanam but KArunakaran stands out among all and he was a real show steal with his timing and the laughs he evoked in the film. A brilliant sidekick to the hero indeed and no wonder he bagged a role in our Thalaivar's movie. Keep going Karuna you were amazing.Siddarth: Well he has come out of his chocolate boy image and good to see Siddarth accepting the role even though the movie is mainly centered on Simha. He was cool as usual and he has done his part really well.Guru Somasundaram: Was he kept under the wraps after Aranya Kandam and Pandiya Nadu? Was Kollywood not ready to accept brilliant people? Well he was one Person whom i really liked and his characterisation was brilliant as the Filmmaking Guru. What a performance it was thoroughly enjoyed each and every scene of his. I wish Kollywood uses these brilliant people to get Kollywood to new heights and use him in frequently in meaningful roles such as AranyaKandam and Jigarthanda. Kudos Sir. Lakshmi Menen, Ramachandran Durairaj, Aadukalam Naren and Sangili Murugan were apt in their respective roles. Watch out for the Surprises in store in the Vijay Sethupathi Cameo.Coming to the technicians.Gavemic U Ary: Brilliant Camera, focus and lighting. I couldn't believe that it was Madurai and it could be shown this beautiful after watching the same old routine Madurai gangster flicks. This one stands out. Without Gavemic's colour and tone the movie wouldn't have been the same as it is now. Its his sheer brilliance that makes this movie complete.Santhosh Narayan: The beats , the drums the percussions Wow !!!!!!!!!!Awestuck with his brilliant BGM and Songs. Couldn't ask for more. Mesmerised with his sounds and songs.Last but not the least, Karthik Subbaraj: A commendable attempt and a well written script. You haven't brought in a brilliant story but you have made a brilliant script and transformed it into a brilliant movie. We are asking for more movies of you and your brilliance Karthik. A big thumbs up for you. Brilliant is all i can say.The thrills , actions , suspense, romance, awesome screenplay, Realistic Acting by the leads and the supporting Characters, brilliant Songs and BGM and an awesome Camera and not to miss the brilliant directing skill of Karthik is the USP of Jigarthanda.Go watch it only in theatres.

9,New genre of movie !,"The first thing that anyone can say after watching the movie is that its a new genre of movie.Its a story of an aspiring director who attempts making a action movie on a don's life, decides to follow such a living rowdy and in the attempt gets caught by the group. Till this point the movie is paced with good action, seriousness and leaves the audience in suspense for the interval.After the interval, the movie has dynamic change in the direction of the story where in the gangster (Assault Sethu) himselves gets interested in the movie on his life and gives all the detail that the director wanted. But what happens after that is completely what you will never expect. The humour has worked out in an extra ordinary way that your hands might pain clapping and ur stomach might pain laughing.The notable performance by Simhaa (Sethu) is added advantage in the movie. The characterization is so powerful that even after seeing him as a comedian in previous movies, you wouldn't feel it anywhere in the first half.I can certainly say the movie has all the gripping elements to make the audience to be involved with the script from few mins from beginning till the end. The movie has achieved what was intended and defines to the meaning of the title (Hot-Cool) (First half-Second Half), But you cannot make a clear choice whether it was a complete movie in spite of the efforts put in the climax to justify it. And the most powerfully introduced character gives all the details of his murders as a recording which also adds to contradictory facts.",new genre movie,first thing that anyone can say after watching movie is that its new genre movie its story aspiring director who attempts making action movie dons life decides follow such living rowdy attempt gets caught by group till this point movie is paced with good action seriousness leaves audience suspense interval after interval movie has dynamic change direction story where gangster assault sethu himselves gets interested movie his life gives all detail that director wanted but what happens after that is completely what you will never expect humour has worked out extra ordinary way that your hands might pain clapping ur stomach might pain laughing notable performance by simhaa sethu is added advantage movie characterization is so powerful that even after seeing him as comedian previous movies you wouldnt feel it anywhere first half i can certainly say movie has all gripping elements make audience be involved with script few mins beginning till end movie has achieved what was intended defines meaning title hot cool first half second half but you cannot make clear choice whether it was complete movie spite efforts put climax justify it most powerfully introduced character gives all details his murders as recording which also adds contradictory facts,0.41657287157287154,0.14234487734487736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8,Really loved the cinematography of Jigarthanda.,"Really loved the cinematography of Jigarthanda. Visual Compositions have huge connect with each and every scene and Colors are brilliantly used. Its really mind-blowing experience.Read this article in the Hindu Newpaper and you know why Gavemic U Ary cinematographer of Jigarthanda movie is so special. Two creative decisions were made before the shooting began. ""There are two houses that are featured a lot,"" says Gavemic. ""Siddharth and Karunakaran (the hero and his sidekick) live in one, while Bobby Simha (the gangster and antagonist) lives in the other."" It was a fairly simple decision to stick to primary colors for the former, due to the contrast of Siddharth's fair skin and Karunakaran's dark complexion. ""We decided to do away with red, as we found it too harsh for the film, and chose to use only blue and green,"" he says. This explains why the curtains and the borders of the door in Karunakaran's house are green and the wall, blue. ""We naturally opted for dark colors in the gangster's house. It was my decision to make the curtains white though, as I didn't want the audience to be distracted by too much color.""",really loved cinematography jigarthanda,really loved cinematography jigarthanda visual compositions have huge connect with each every scene colors are brilliantly used its really mind blowing experience read this article hindu newpaper you know why gavemic u ary cinematographer jigarthanda movie is so special two creative decisions were made before shooting began there are two houses that are featured lot says gavemic siddharth karunakaran hero his sidekick live one while bobby simha gangster antagonist lives other it was fairly simple decision stick primary colors former due contrast siddharths fair skin karunakarans dark complexion we decided do away with red as we found it too harsh film chose use only blue green he says this explains why curtains borders door karunakarans house are green wall blue we naturally opted dark colors gangsters house it was my decision make curtains white though as i didnt want audience be distracted by too much color,0.45105820105820105,0.15346320346320344,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10,Must Drink It!!!,"For now, the first movie review I am giving in a written text. I was badly in need to say someone about the movie Jikardhanda and here goes.I never know it tasted , but this movie means it should be awesome. When there were too much of commercial movies with same kind of punch dialogs, mass hero entry, unwanted songs and hero bringing the Villain down this movie Stands as an unique piece. You will never see a ""already- seen- this-scene"" effect.There are unexpected twists back to back. A gangster movie with perfect characterization and apt choice of characters.You could see most of Black and Yellow shades scene on the screen which highlights the City Madurai. A Villain can be a hero is the theme and this couldn't have been perfectly done by anyone else other than Simha. His Madurai slang and Body language depicted how a real gangster would look like.He lived the character. Siddarth the so called hero also played his part well. All actors have put on so much of effort to drag you inside the movie without making us give even a small neck turn. The first half is more of Hollywood Style and Black Comedy. Second half is full of humor which at times makes you miss a wit while you were hell laughing. Santhosh Narayanan BGM and Songs gave the life to the movie. He is one of the best music director of India in the recent. Karthik has given a treat better than Pizza. Everyone will surely like his South Indian delicious. Hats off. Overall worth the cost with 10 on 10 and yes you can pay more than that. Yes I am going to watch again.",must drink it,now first movie review i am giving written text i was badly need say someone about movie jikardhanda here goes i never know it tasted but this movie means it should be awesome when there were too much commercial movies with same kind punch dialogs mass hero entry unwanted songs hero bringing villain down this movie stands as unique piece you will never see already seen this scene effect there are unexpected twists back back gangster movie with perfect characterization apt choice characters you could see most black yellow shades scene screen which highlights city madurai villain can be hero is theme this couldnt have been perfectly done by anyone else other than simha his madurai slang body language depicted how real gangster would look like he lived character siddarth so called hero also played his part well all actors have put so much effort drag you inside movie without making us give even small neck turn first half is more hollywood style black comedy second half is full humor which at times makes you miss wit while you were hell laughing santhosh narayanan bgm songs gave life movie he is one best music director india recent karthik has given treat better than pizza everyone will surely like his south indian delicious hats off overall worth cost with 10 10 yes you can pay more than that yes i am going watch again,0.44005255255255254,0.23588588588588588,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

9,A MUST WATCH !!,"Karthik Subbaraj who received unprecedented acclaim when he dished out Pizza (2012) as his directorial debut has served us a delicious drink in his second outing. Jigarthanda tells the story of a short filmmaker Karthik (Siddharth) who comes to Madurai to develop a script for his debut feature based on the life of real life don ""Assault"" Sethu (an excellent Simha). He settles down with his friend Oorani (Karunakaran) and attempts to profile the life of this ruthless gangster for his movie.The duo follow several leads and covertly try to get inputs from various associates of Sethu including some of his goons as well as Kayal (Lakshmi Menon) whose mother is an Idly vendor with Sethu as a regular customer. Though Kayal is smitten by him and even proposes to him unilaterally, Karthik, with his single minded intention of making his movie, merely pretends to be in love with her to access details about Sethu in the same vein that he tries to leverage the weakness of others. After a series of quirky and hilarious twists, Karthik and his friend land in a monumental mess when they are caught red handed by Sethu spying on his activities. Sethu presumes them to be working with the police who want to finish him in an encounter. What follows is a roller coaster ride that keeps the viewer guessing with several surprises fused with the process of how Karthik manages to make his debut feature.Jigarthanda proves unequivocally that Pizza was not a mere flash in the pan and Karthik Subbaraj is an auteur to watch out. His skills in cleverly weaving a metamovie on the travails of wannabe directors within the fabric of what is a gangster flick on an apparent level are praiseworthy. The narrative is embellished with Tarantinoesque flourishes of raw violence and oodles of comedy even in sequences where they are least expected. While Siddharth is impressive as the opportunist aspiring director with a singular focus who pays scant regard to manipulating others for his goals, Lakshmi Menon is convincing in an unconventional, albeit minor part of a smitten lover who could throw a spanner at her beloved's dreams when spurned. But, Jigarthanda belongs to Simha who nails the part of the dreaded psychotic don, ""Assault"" Sethu, oozing terror from his every pore. He straddles the entire emotional spectrum of this layered character from being ruthless and menacing to being darkly hilarious. His performance is the lynch pin of the movie and deserves several plaudits and awards that are sure to come his way. Karunakaran, as Oorani, is impeccable in his comic timing and goofy expressions.Karthik Subburaj's detailing is impressive - be it the pulse of the city that never sleeps (Madurai) or in the eccentricities of the minor characters. Santhosh Narayanan's score is brilliant and accentuates the intensity the proceedings. Although the songs may not be stand out chartbusters, that blend beautifully with the flow of the narrative. Cinematography by Gavemic U Ary captures the proceedings beautifully in resplendent tones. Despite its self proclaimed tag of a ""musical gangster"" movie, Jigarthanda's ambitions are much more chimeric. It is also an effective dark comedy, a con movie and above all, an incisive satire on the state of Tamil cinema where the constraints of commercial viability continue to choke the creativity of aspiring filmmakers.Yet, at a deeper level, it is the metamovie where Karthik Subbaraj, appears to convey, through his namesake protagonist, through what could well be his personal experiences before succeeding in Kollywood, that despite these challenges, all is not lost for the filmmakers who could master these murky waters if they dare to remain steadfast in their focus and could smartly use their sails to navigate to the shores of success. The movie is not without its flaws, especially the length which clocks a little less than three hours, resulting in some bit of drag in the second half.

The second half is as diametrically opposite from the first as it can be. The denouement is real doozy and makes for a truly different, genre-crossing and rules defying visual experience.Bobby Simha, who plays the gangster, is the beating heart of this epic. He gets the role of a lifetime and dazzles the mind with his brilliance. He, deservedly, won the national award for best supporting actor.This is Mr. Subbaraj's second directorial venture (haven't seen his first, a horror movie, Pizza , which was remade in Hindi, too).

6,A big joke/spoof on the name of Gangster Comedy gone fortunately RIGHT for the sake of entertainment.,"Jigarthanda (2014) : Briefing Review -A big joke/spoof on the name of Gangster Comedy gone fortunately RIGHT for the sake of entertainment. Believe me, making a gangster film is easy but making a gangster comedy is difficult and that's why there are only few countable good films in this genre. In 90s decade, Hollywood and British Cinema both made many fine products in this genre which have been loved by audience as well as influenced many filmmkers. Jigarthanda is a nice attempt but it's bit lengthy and risky. In Bollywood, we saw classic like 'Hera Pheri' (2000), if that can be called a gangster comedy, and then it's sequel 'Phir Hera Pheri' (2006) also came out as a very good product if not a Classic. And then we saw 'Welcome' (2007) which is certainly the last brilliant film in this Gangster comedy genre and somewhere I feel like, watching Jigarthanda after watching 'Welcome' so many times has taken away lot of impact. It has also left with me vision to see several flaws in the film because it's quite difficult to make such good comedies nowdays. There was Film like Soodhu Kavvum (2013) as an exception though and Jigarthanda is sort of close to that one, but surely not better. An aspiring director targets a ruthless gangster because he wants to make a violent gangster film. His discreet attempts to research the gangster fail miserably. Finally when he gets caught snooping, things hit the fan and chaotic gesture of the situations makes a fine comedy out of it. Performances, dialogues, screenplay, music and direction all things are fine at their places but there's nothing special to make a fuss about it. The film is nowhere suitable to the IMDb standards of 8+ Rating (only if you believe it) but sometimes it's good to have fun than quality, no? Jigarthanda is that Fun but not Quality. Choose what want and then only watch it.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",big joke spoof name gangster comedy gone fortunately right sake entertainment,jigarthanda 2014 briefing review big joke spoof name gangster comedy gone fortunately right sake entertainment believe me making gangster film is easy but making gangster comedy is difficult thats why there are only few countable good films this genre 90s decade hollywood british cinema both made many fine products this genre which have been loved by audience as well as influenced many filmmkers jigarthanda is nice attempt but its bit lengthy risky bollywood we saw classic like hera pheri 2000 if that can be called gangster comedy then its sequel phir hera pheri 2006 also came out as very good product if not classic then we saw welcome 2007 which is certainly last brilliant film this gangster comedy genre somewhere i feel like watching jigarthanda after watching welcome so many times has taken away lot impact it has also left with me vision see several flaws film because its quite difficult make such good comedies nowdays there was film like soodhu kavvum 2013 as exception though jigarthanda is sort close that one but surely not better aspiring director targets ruthless gangster because he wants make violent gangster film his discreet attempts research gangster fail miserably finally when he gets caught snooping things hit fan chaotic gesture situations makes fine comedy out it performances dialogues screenplay music direction all things are fine at their places but theres nothing special make fuss about it film is nowhere suitable imdb standards 8 rating only if you believe it but sometimes its good have fun than quality no jigarthanda is that fun but not quality choose what want then only watch it rating 6 5 10 by,0.5401375661375661,0.18678306878306883,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.16}"
10,A groundbreaking masterpiece.,"Prior to watching the remakes, I had to make sure I was aware of the Tamil original. Hence, I finally watched Jigarthanda, and enjoyed it throughout the duration. I laughed a lot more than I expected, and was impressed with the storyline. Now, before you say it's copied from A Dirty Carnival, let me tell you it's not; only the basic idea that a filmmaker wants to make a gangster film and consults a real gangster, is actually similar. Unlike the Korean film, Jigarthanda is full of laughs and has an overall lighter tone. The suspense, the action and the emotional bits accompany the film well and the end product turns out to be impressive.Jigarthanda truly rests on the shoulders of Bobby Simha, who justifies his National award victory for his role with his subtle, terrific performance. Sure, Siddharth and others are also impressive, but it is indeed tough to imagine Jigarthanda without Simha, who displays his skills as per the scene and by the end makes sure you end up a big fan of him. The key theme of filmmaking, the dreams associated with it and the motivation to never give up can resonate big time with budding filmmakers.I thoroughly enjoyed the comedic bits and found some thriller elements well-utilized. Besides, the action is raw and grounded without going overboard; people die when they're shot and feel pain when they're hurt. This is where the action department scores big, and the music (songs and background score) is also commendable. The editing is razor sharp and the writing is a major asset. All in all, Jigarthanda feels like a very different gangster film which is replete both with the familiar and unfamiliar elements one associates with the genre. Strongly recommended.",groundbreaking masterpiece,prior watching remakes i had make sure i was aware tamil original hence i finally watched jigarthanda enjoyed it throughout duration i laughed lot more than i expected was impressed with storyline now before you say its copied dirty carnival let me tell you its not only basic idea that filmmaker wants make gangster film consults real gangster is actually similar unlike korean film jigarthanda is full laughs has overall lighter tone suspense action emotional bits accompany film well end product turns out be impressive jigarthanda truly rests shoulders bobby simha who justifies his national award victory his role with his subtle terrific performance sure siddharth others are also impressive but it is indeed tough imagine jigarthanda without simha who displays his skills as per scene by end makes sure you end up big fan him key theme filmmaking dreams associated with it motivation never give up can resonate big time with budding filmmakers i thoroughly enjoyed comedic bits found some thriller elements well utilized besides action is raw grounded without going overboard people die when theyre shot feel pain when theyre hurt this is where action department scores big music songs background score is also commendable editing is razor sharp writing is major asset all all jigarthanda feels like very different gangster film which is replete both with familiar unfamiliar elements one associates with genre strongly recommended,0.5261874236874239,0.17423433048433049,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.3}"
7,Good movie...but,"Jigarthanda is a brilliant film directed by Karthik subburaj. Siddharth is the hero but it is the Vila Boby Simha who walks away with the honours.Sidhharth has gone the aamir khan way by giving space to Simha to outshine him. Kudos for that.The film is definitely different from the usual run of the mill stuff that we see, but in the end, some disturbing questions are asked which have no answers.The Villain is a murderer but goes scot free in the end. Worse, he earns the sympathy of the audience. Does it absolve him of ll the innocent people he has killed.I was in fact very disturbed, specially in the introductory scene, where the villain torches an innocent journalist & the audience clapped.Also, the hero Siddharth is shown as becoming a ""rowdy"" at the end.Directors & heroes should realize the impact films have on people, specially youngsters & be more responsible while making films.",good movie but,jigarthanda is brilliant film directed by karthik subburaj siddharth is hero but it is vila boby simha who walks away with honours sidhharth has gone aamir khan way by giving space simha outshine him kudos that film is definitely different usual run mill stuff that we see but end some disturbing questions are asked which have no answers villain is murderer but goes scot free end worse he earns sympathy audience does it absolve him ll innocent people he has killed i was fact very disturbed specially introductory scene where villain torches innocent journalist audience clapped also hero siddharth is shown as becoming rowdy at end directors heroes should realize impact films have people specially youngsters be more responsible while making films,0.5870535714285714,0.23214285714285718,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10,Jigarthanda Review...A Different Movie that worked out,"Jigarthanda is an amazing movie that all of you should watch in the theaters. Here are a few reasons why.1. Superb performance from Simha, nails the character and really makes the story great 2. Great script/screenplay by Karthik Subbaraj. He was the reason this movie worked and the twists in the movie was what made it really interesting., 3. Santhosh Narayanan composed some great BGM for this movie and also a great soundtrack 4. Although not that prominent, Siddharth does a good job in his role 5. The movie is extremely hilarious, especially in the second half, but it sticks to the script and doesn't get out of hand.6. Karunakaran does a good job of making the scenes comical and his timing is almost perfect.7. The cinematography in this movie is extremely good and crisp, especially liked how the camera was still, nicely zoomed, the angles in which the shots were taken.8. If you liked Pizza, this movie has plenty more to enjoy than Pizza.9. Only minor flaw, there was almost no use for Lakshmi Menon but in order for the script to have worked she had to be part of the story.10. Final verdict: Definitely an award winning movie (Cinematography, BGM, Simha, Screenplay, Direction, Music, Comedian, and possibly film)and everyone has shown they have potential for films in the near future.",jigarthanda review different movie that worked out,jigarthanda is amazing movie that all you should watch theaters here are few reasons why 1 superb performance simha nails character really makes story great 2 great script screenplay by karthik subbaraj he was reason this movie worked twists movie was what made it really interesting 3 santhosh narayanan composed some great bgm this movie also great soundtrack 4 although not that prominent siddharth does good job his role 5 movie is extremely hilarious especially second half but it sticks script doesnt get out hand 6 karunakaran does good job making scenes comical his timing is almost perfect 7 cinematography this movie is extremely good crisp especially liked how camera was still nicely zoomed angles which shots were taken 8 if you liked pizza this movie has plenty more enjoy than pizza 9 only minor flaw there was almost no use lakshmi menon but order script have worked she had be part story 10 final verdict definitely award winning movie cinematography bgm simha screenplay direction music comedian possibly film everyone has shown they have potential films near future,0.6605392156862745,0.40098039215686265,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.34, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"
2,STUPID MOVIE !,I am a great fan of film and I watch all kinds of film from all around the world. This particular movie also crossed my mind and I watched it. It's a waste. I mean what the director of the movie was trying to do. The plot of the movie is confusing. Is it a gangster or comedy or a neo noir fantasy action. Really I still don't get it. If it was a gangster movie then the plot should been within the terror environment in which people lives but that is fully absent. It shows Sethu as a dangerous gang leader but the fear is absent from the movie. If it was a comedy movie then the plot about gangster is a waste. I was shocked when the plot turned comical when Sethu was displayed as a comedian and he finally turned his life from crime to acting!!!!. It doesn't fit in that way in real life my dear.It could have been a good action movie with the available types of technical perfections but NO. Thats out of the box. The performance of the lead actor is also not satisfying. Few things are good but wholly its irrelevant. The rating is 2/10 only for Nasser sir in beginning of the movie.,stupid movie,i am great fan film i watch all kinds film all around world this particular movie also crossed my mind i watched it its waste i mean what director movie was trying do plot movie is confusing is it gangster or comedy or neo noir fantasy action really i still dont get it if it was gangster movie then plot should been within terror environment which people lives but that is fully absent it shows sethu as dangerous gang leader but fear is absent movie if it was comedy movie then plot about gangster is waste i was shocked when plot turned comical when sethu was displayed as comedian he finally turned his life crime acting it doesnt fit that way real life my dear it could have been good action movie with available types technical perfections but no thats out box performance lead actor is also not satisfying few things are good but wholly its irrelevant rating is 2 10 only nasser sir beginning movie,0.5108333333333333,0.008166666666666673,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.28}"
