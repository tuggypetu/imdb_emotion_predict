,Distinctive & Unforgettable Masterpiece,"One of the many things that made Hitchcock such a great director is that he did not just stick to the same formula time after time; all of his best movies have their own unique feel and characteristics. ""Vertigo"" is particularly distinctive, both as a complex story filled with suspense, and as a fascinating study in psychological tension. While it lacks the humor of some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, and sometimes moves rather slowly, it is unforgettable, and a great achievement by the director and his cast.If you have never seen it, you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about the plot, although the actual story is somewhat secondary to the ways that the characters are tested and their weaknesses exposed by the various events. Hitchcock uses a complicated story, interesting characters, lavish visual detail, and deliberate pacing, plus a fine musical score by the incomparable Bernard Hermann, to produce a mysterious, almost unearthly, atmosphere. The tension rarely lets up, and the viewer is caught up completely in it, at times almost to the point of discomfort. It's the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail.There are also some great acting performances. Jimmy Stewart is outstanding in a role far different from his usual screen persona. He enables the viewer to sympathize completely with him, even as we cringe at many of his character's actions and decisions. Kim Novak is completely convincing in a difficult dual role, and the movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance. The rest of the cast all have much smaller roles, but are all quite good too, especially Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's (Stewart's) old friend, who provides important insight into Scottie's character.""Vertigo"" is a classic by any standard. It's a must-see that remains just as impressive with each viewing.",distinctive unforgettable masterpiece,one many things that made hitchcock such great director is that he did not just stick same formula time after time all his best movies have their own unique feel characteristics vertigo is particularly distinctive both as complex story filled with suspense as fascinating study psychological tension while it lacks humor some hitchcocks other masterpieces sometimes moves rather slowly it is unforgettable great achievement by director his cast if you have never seen it you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about plot although actual story is somewhat secondary ways that characters are tested their weaknesses exposed by various events hitchcock uses complicated story interesting characters lavish visual detail deliberate pacing plus fine musical score by incomparable bernard hermann produce mysterious almost unearthly atmosphere tension rarely lets up viewer is caught up completely it at times almost point discomfort its kind film that repays careful attention as almost every moment is filled with significant detail there are also some great acting performances jimmy stewart is outstanding role far different his usual screen persona he enables viewer sympathize completely with him even as we cringe at many his characters actions decisions kim novak is completely convincing difficult dual role movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance rest cast all have much smaller roles but are all quite good too especially barbara bel geddes as scotties stewarts old friend who provides important insight into scotties character vertigo is classic by any standard its must see that remains just as impressive with each viewing,0.5909090909090909,0.26621212121212123,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Let there be color!,"Since there are already so many real good comments on this film I want to focus on only one aspect.Vertigo is a great example for what color films really can look like! Not only do I want to praise the quality of the Technicolor dye transfer prints but also more the way Hitchcock used color to create moods. Many directors used light to create moods in black and white movies but only very few ever got so far as to use the much greater palette of colors for the same purpose. One wonders why. Some directors decide for an overall color look, which is often done in the lab, but not on the set.Vertigo is full of scenes where the colors have been saturated or changed to create a special feeling. Hitchcock even went so far as to openly dye some frames is bright unnatural colors. He played around with colors in all his color films but never as much as in this one. Think for example on James Stewart's nightmare in the middle of the film. There are frames dyed purple and green; the cemetery scenes are red, inserted to the rhythm of the music with normal frames. Kim Novak is often bathed in colored light like in the famous hotel room scene, where she appears like a ghost with all the green light around her.The shading is also important. In the scene in the bookshop we hear a dark and sad story while at the same time the light dimes down to simulate dusk. In the scene where Judy remembers the real events in the bell tower it starts with an outdoor scene, which we have already seen but it is now much darker than the first time. In the sequence where Stewart follows Novak to the cemetery everything feels unnatural since every scene glows through the use of a filter that creates a blur. The non-color of Kim Novak's dress as Madeleine is also a very important aspect in the film. She has to color her hair to become Madeleine again at the end of the picture.The way color is used in this film gives it this dreamlike quality that allows endless interpretations. A true masterpiece!",let there be color,since there are already so many real good comments this film i want focus only one aspect vertigo is great example what color films really can look like not only do i want praise quality technicolor dye transfer prints but also more way hitchcock used color create moods many directors used light create moods black white movies but only very few ever got so far as use much greater palette colors same purpose one wonders why some directors decide overall color look which is often done lab but not set vertigo is full scenes where colors have been saturated or changed create special feeling hitchcock even went so far as openly dye some frames is bright unnatural colors he played around with colors all his color films but never as much as this one think example james stewarts nightmare middle film there are frames dyed purple green cemetery scenes are red inserted rhythm music with normal frames kim novak is often bathed colored light like famous hotel room scene where she appears like ghost with all green light around her shading is also important scene bookshop we hear dark sad story while at same time light dimes down simulate dusk scene where judy remembers real events bell tower it starts with outdoor scene which we have already seen but it is now much darker than first time sequence where stewart follows novak cemetery everything feels unnatural since every scene glows through use filter that creates blur non color kim novaks dress as madeleine is also very important aspect film she has color her hair become madeleine again at end picture way color is used this film gives it this dreamlike quality that allows endless interpretations true masterpiece,0.540860095976375,0.1911609449981543,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.46, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,Creepy and engaging.,"It's rather strange that this film was a box office flop, as it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's better movies. The only problem with ""Vertigo"" is that in order to really enjoy it, you need to turn off your brain and just accept the movie. If you think the plot out TOO MUCH, you'll find yourself asking too many questions and not just enjoying the film...like my oldest daughter did.The film is the story of a somewhat creepy ex-cop (James Stewart). When the film begins, he's emotionally scarred in an accident-an accident that leaves him with a HUGE case of psychologically-based vertigo. He decides to quit the job and is soon approached by an old friend--who wants to hire him to follow his emotionally disturbed wife. What happens next is very weird--and later becomes really creepy. I could say A LOT more but think it's best you just see the film--it has quite a few twists and turns that are bound to catch you by surprise.Overall, a wonderfully original film. The only deficit, for some, is that although Stewart was a wonderful actor, he was too old for this role. Still, I could look past this and enjoyed it immensely.",creepy engaging,its rather strange that this film was box office flop as its one alfred hitchcocks better movies only problem with vertigo is that order really enjoy it you need turn off your brain just accept movie if you think plot out too much youll find yourself asking too many questions not just enjoying film like my oldest daughter did film is story somewhat creepy ex cop james stewart when film begins hes emotionally scarred accident accident that leaves him with huge case psychologically based vertigo he decides quit job is soon approached by old friend who wants hire him follow his emotionally disturbed wife what happens next is very weird later becomes really creepy i could say lot more but think its best you just see film it has quite few twists turns that are bound catch you by surprise overall wonderfully original film only deficit some is that although stewart was wonderful actor he was too old this role still i could look past this enjoyed it immensely,0.5338709677419354,0.12983870967741937,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,You're not lost. Mother's here.,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D'Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being. Very much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson's fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante's Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on. Technically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann's score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn't harnessed on too many other occasions. Vertigo is a film that I myself wasn't too taken with on my first viewing, it's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did. 10/10",youre not lost mothers here,john scottie ferguson is san francisco cop who decides quit service after his acrophobia results him being unable save life colleague whilst taking it easy he gets call old school friend gavin elster asking him if he wouldnt mind doing little bit detective work him job is simply tail his wife because shes obsessed with ancestress who committed suicide wife madeline is showing signs herself being suicidal ferguson tails her diligently as tail progresses ferguson himself starts become ever obsessed about demur blonde madeline as story twists turns fergusons obsession will have far reaching consequences both parties vertigo is alfred hitchcocks most discussed dissected critically reappraised film based novel by pierre boileau called dentre les morts also writer diabolique vertigo was not well liked its release unable be viewed some time due copyright film was restored destroyed negative into glorious 70mm print now all its glory it can be seen as one greatest films have ever been made what is most striking about vertigo outside hitchcock baring his innermost that is is that its plot surface is simplicity personified but delving deeper repeat viewings are necessity its apparent that vertigo is chilling force cinema taking great delight gnawing away at your perceptions perhaps even your own capabilities as human being very much film two great halves vertigo first seems intent being almost ghost story like mystery once prologue has introduced us fergusons fear heights we then enter almost dream like sequence events as ferguson tails troubled madeline suggestion reincarnation bleakly leading death hangs heavy as hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings then film shifts into dark territory as obsessions nods dantes inferno feverish dreams take control hitchcock as we have come learn over years lays out his soul us audience partake uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination story all which is leading us spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking end our own dizzying journey that alfred his team have taken us technically film is magnificent opening credits saul bass brilliantly prep us what is about unfold while bernard herrmanns score is as good as anything he ever did unnerving one minute swirlingly romantic next truly incredible score hitchcock himself is firing top draw introducing us brilliant zoom forward track back camera technique induce feeling vertigo itself with that merely component two hours gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work james stewart as scottie ferguson goes real deep play it out with edgy believability that decries his aw shucks trademark years since past kim novak as madeline is perhaps quintessential hitchcock blonde perfect with duality aspects role playing off stewarts ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill it however should be noted that hitchcock his loyal subjects had work hard get novak right role but result proves that novak had ability that sadly wasnt harnessed too many other occasions vertigo is film that i myself wasnt too taken with my first viewing its only during revisits that piece has come grab me by soul refuse let go it not only holds up revisits it also gets better with each subsequent viewing it is simply film that demands be seen as many times as possible not only one greatest american films ever made one greatest films ever made period so invest your soul it just way that hitchcock himself so clearly did 10 10,0.5858541666666667,0.13369642857142855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,Detective Obsessed,"Although it got at best mixed reviews when first released, Vertigo is now considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films. A tribute to the players, the director, and the composer of that haunting musical score that will stay with you forever.The music is probably more important here than in most films, let alone most Hitchcock films. Because for most of the first half of the film and a great deal of the second half, it is without dialogue. In fact Kim Novak does not have a spoken line until about 48 minutes into the little more than 2 hour feature. She's under James Stewart's surveillance and the whole story of his growing obsession with her is told through his facial expressions and through Bernard Herrmann's music.Stewart is a cop retired on disability who is hired by an old college friend Tom Helmore to follow his wife. Helmore tells Stewart a tale about his wife falling under the spirit of her dead great grandmother who committed suicide. The wife he's following is played by Kim Novak. Novak in fact makes a suicide attempt and by jumping into San Francisco bay and Stewart jumps in and saves her.In a brief prologue the reason for Stewart's disability is told. While on the police force, he lost a man while pursuing the suspect in a rooftop chase. Another cop was killed trying to save Stewart who had slipped and was hanging on to a roof gutter for his dear life. After that Stewart acquired an understandable fear of heights with accompanying dizziness, vertigo.Later on at an old mission which has significance for Novak's family, Novak runs up to the top of the bell tower and Stewart because of his Vertigo can't pursue her to prevent her from jumping off and taking her life.Later on he spots Kim Novak again with a different color hair and this time essentially stalks her until they meet. By now he's totally obsessed with the dead Novak who he fell in love with.Alfred Hitchcock is plumbing some depths of the human psyche in Vertigo. Certainly good old all American Jimmy Stewart would not be one you would think of casting as a voyeur and a stalker. But he pulls off the performance in probably the film with the least dialogue Alfred Hitchcock ever made since sound came in.Kim Novak is hauntingly beautiful in Vertigo, she has to be or the whole plot would make no sense. Barbara Bel Geddes is in this also as Stewart's girl friend who finds herself losing him to an obsession with a ghost. She also serves as a sounding board for Stewart as he expresses some of his feelings to her.This was the first of two films Stewart and Novak made together. Ironically enough the second one, Bell Book and Candle, is about a witch played by Novak who actually uses witchcraft to ensnare Stewart. Given Stewart's obsession with Novak in Vertigo, if Hitchcock had thrown in witchcraft into the plot, the audience would certainly have believed it.Of course this is an Alfred Hitchcock film and therefore not all is as it seems. I can't sat any more, but there are no happy endings for anyone in this haunting film.",detective obsessed,although it got at best mixed reviews when first released vertigo is now considered one alfred hitchcocks classic films tribute players director composer that haunting musical score that will stay with you forever music is probably more important here than most films let alone most hitchcock films because most first half film great deal second half it is without dialogue fact kim novak does not have spoken line until about 48 minutes into little more than 2 hour feature shes under james stewarts surveillance whole story his growing obsession with her is told through his facial expressions through bernard herrmanns music stewart is cop retired disability who is hired by old college friend tom helmore follow his wife helmore tells stewart tale about his wife falling under spirit her dead great grandmother who committed suicide wife hes following is played by kim novak novak fact makes suicide attempt by jumping into san francisco bay stewart jumps saves her brief prologue reason stewarts disability is told while police force he lost man while pursuing suspect rooftop chase another cop was killed trying save stewart who had slipped was hanging roof gutter his dear life after that stewart acquired understandable fear heights with accompanying dizziness vertigo later at old mission which has significance novaks family novak runs up top bell tower stewart because his vertigo cant pursue her prevent her jumping off taking her life later he spots kim novak again with different color hair this time essentially stalks her until they meet by now hes totally obsessed with dead novak who he fell love with alfred hitchcock is plumbing some depths human psyche vertigo certainly good old all american jimmy stewart would not be one you would think casting as voyeur stalker but he pulls off performance probably film with least dialogue alfred hitchcock ever made since sound came kim novak is hauntingly beautiful vertigo she has be or whole plot would make no sense barbara bel geddes is this also as stewarts girl friend who finds herself losing him obsession with ghost she also serves as sounding board stewart as he expresses some his feelings her this was first two films stewart novak made together ironically enough second one bell book candle is about witch played by novak who actually uses witchcraft ensnare stewart given stewarts obsession with novak vertigo if hitchcock had thrown witchcraft into plot audience would certainly have believed it course this is alfred hitchcock film therefore not all is as it seems i cant sat any more but there are no happy endings anyone this haunting film,0.3870952380952381,0.15920238095238093,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,Only the most shallow man would fail to be impressed by appearances.,"""Vertigo"" is considered Hitchcock's masterpiece by high-brows and viewed as a slow, dull movie by proletarians. Indulge this Olympian generalizations for a moment. If you don't know the story by now, it goes something like this. Jimmy Stewart is a San Francisco detective retired from the force because he contracted a severe case of acrophobia on the job. An old college friend, Gavin Elster, hires him to follow Elster's wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak) around. Elster is afraid Madeleine is going nuts. Stewart takes the job and is soon hooked on the lovely Madeleine. He rescues her from a suicide attempt, lugs her unconscious body to his own apartment, undresses her, and puts her in his bed until she recovers. Stewart and Madeleine fall in love, but she's still balmy and climbs to the tower of an old church to kill herself. Stewart can't follow because of his acrophobia. He blames himself. Later, while wandering the city streets, he spots a girl named Judy Barton (also Kim Novak) who resembles the departed Madeleine. Stewart gets to know her, squires her around, and step-by-step has her dress and groom herself exactly like his lost love. Then he discovers that Judy IS in fact his lost love. Judy was in cahoots with Gavin Elster and Stewart was a victim of a hoax designed to get rid of Elster's real wife. It ends tragically.It's neither a masterpiece nor dull, really. I don't doubt for a minute that it's Hitchcock's most personal movie. Cripes, he's got this luscious blond he keeps dressing and undressing, gorgeous and sexy, but also unattainable and ghostly. (A ghost of substantial heft, though.) That was always Hitchcock's fantasy, the icy Nordic who would attack you in the back seat of a taxi. (Poor Alma Reville, his wife, a rather homely brunette dwarf.) On top of the personal interest that Hitchcock lavished on the story, he adds some technical dazzle. Not too much. The acrophobic detective stares down the tall campanile and the camera simultaneously zooms in and dollies back. The tactic was so successful it's been imitated a number of times. And when Stewart and Novak finally kiss and make love in her green-lighted apartment, the director has them and the camera on a turntable that slowly revolves and shows us varied haunting backdrops. And the movie wouldn't be what it is without Bernard Hermann's romantic and oneiristic score.The whole film is meant to be dream-like and that's why it's understandable that some people would see it as irritatingly slow. It follows Edgar Allan Poe's theory of literary aesthetics. Poe threw reason off the bell tower and went for eerie effects, period. A man buries a murder victim under the floor but nails a cat in with the body by mistake. How can anyone miss a cat that's in the burial chamber? I can imagine viewers now, squirming, and asking, ""Where the hell is the logic in this movie?"" Let's put it this way. You are a girl named Judy Barton. You're pretty but have no marketable skills. A very wealthy man comes to you and offers you money to help him kill his wife. All you have to do is impersonate the wife and trap a former detective named Jimmy Stewart into falling in love with you and then lead him to a place where the wife can be safely killed and still look like suicide.Then, after the rich dude takes off for Europe, leaving you to become your slovenly self, you accidentally run into the victimized Stewart on the streets. (In a city of 700,000.) He doesn't recognize you, naturally, because now, having reverted to your original persona, you look like an overly made-up hooker. But he follows you home, knocks on your door, introduces himself, and asks you for a date. I ask you -- the discerning, sophisticated, somewhat street-savvy viewer -- would you accept? Would you date a man who will almost inevitably find out you're a murderess? One slip of the tongue could do it. The only person stupid enough to accept would also bury a black cat alongside a dead body.Kim Novak is a lot more effective as Madeleine than as Judy. The latter persona is coarse but tender too. The former is elegant and speaks in a ghostly whisper. Kim Novak was probably right for the part. As Judy, she has these overemphatic eyebrows that lend her the appearance of a Universal monster, perhaps one of the lesbian vampires that smiles as she pours you the drugged wine. But of Hitchcock's other actresses at the time, who else could have done better? The photography is splendid. And the director takes us on a Cook's Tour of many of the Bay Area landmarks -- Ernie's restaurant (now gone), Muir Woods almost, The Palace of the Legion of Honor, Fort Point, Mission San Juan Bautista (which has no tower), Point Lobos. And every day is perfectly sunny. Stewart re-dresses Novak at an expensive shop that was Ransohoff's at the time. It, too, is now gone but I took my wife to its less expensive replacement and insisted she buy a signature gray suit with a soft white shirt and a pair of brown heels. She swore she would do no such thing. After a slight scuffle, not nearly as athletic as the papers made it out to be, we wound up with some cheap scrap of an apron. (She never wore it.) It's only in a film in which there is no place for common sense, let alone genuine logic, that a man can create a new woman or resurrect an old one.I find it a fascinating movie, technically almost perfect, and worth repeated viewings if they're not repeated too often. (It's pretty depressing.) It's at once demanding and rewarding. And I'm certainly glad Hitchcock made it, if only to get it out of his system.",only most shallow man would fail be impressed by appearances,vertigo is considered hitchcocks masterpiece by high brows

,Classic Hitchcock and Stewart,"An interesting psychological piece that richly displays Hitchcock's talents. It is unfair to compare this film to the suspense thrillers of today which are subjected to more realism in sex and violence. Hitchcock had to be more subtle in 1958, where I'm sure a work like this, that seems tame by today's standards, appeared bizarre and risqué. Also the acting here seems histrionic; not that people actually spoke like that in the 50s but the audiences liked such dictionally refined dialogue back then as opposed to the lines of modern-day scripts that more accurately portray the way individuals speak. 	James Stewart and Kim Novak are appealing on numerous levels, the former mainly because he doesn't wander far from the amiable joe we have come to expect (even though he does weird-out near the conclusion) and the latter because she maintains a veneer of vulnerability that we can relate to. 	This is not a film I especially like (I couldn't watch it again and again) but I respect for its strong filmmaking.",classic hitchcock stewart,interesting psychological piece that richly displays hitchcocks talents it is unfair compare this film suspense thrillers today which are subjected more realism sex violence hitchcock had be more subtle 1958 where im sure work like this that seems tame by todays standards appeared bizarre risqu also acting here seems histrionic not that people actually spoke like that 50s but audiences liked such dictionally refined dialogue back then as opposed lines modern day scripts that more accurately portray way individuals speak james stewart kim novak are appealing numerous levels former mainly because he doesnt wander far amiable joe we have come expect even though he does weird out near conclusion latter because she maintains veneer vulnerability that we can relate this is not film i especially like i couldnt watch it again again but i respect its strong filmmaking,0.48352490421455935,0.1514367816091954,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,"""I know, I know. I have acrophobia, which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy."" (Scottie to Midge)","Although it was only modestly successful in theaters, time has been kind to VERTIGO and now many believe this is Hitchcock's masterpiece. Time was NOT kind to the original prints of the film, and in the mid-1990s Universal Studios put up one million dollars for a two-year restoration of the film. This is covered completely in a fairly fascinating 29-minute extra on the DVD, originally broadcast as an A&E special. The entire original film-making process is covered, the movie was first called ""From Among The Dead"", and includes current interviews with many principals, including Novak and Bel Geddes, plus the techniques used for the restoration. This special edition DVD should be a must-own for any fan of the film VERTIGO. The sound and picture are just fabulous for a film made in 1957.My review, following, contains certain SPOILERS which are necessary for my summary. Please read no further if you have not seen the film. Watch the film first, you will not be disappointed.The film starts with cops chasing a crook on SF rooftops, Scottie (James Stewart, 49) misses one roof, is hanging high from a gutter, cop returns to offer assistance, but instead falls to his death. This traumatic experience triggers the vertigo in Scottie, makes him unsuited for police work, he quits, and Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) tells him only another emotional shock will bring him out of it. Midge, an artist, not so secretly wants Scottie, but while they are good friends, he just doesn't love her.Old college friend, wealthy shipbuilding magnate, hires Scottie to follow his wife who had been acting strangely. He meets Madaleine (Kim Novak, 24) and follows her to find that she visits the grave of Carlotta, who died at 25 in 1857, also visits the portrait of Carlotta at the art museum, has ""visions"" of being in a Spanish mission, all indications are that the dead Carlotta is taking over Madaleine's mind. While following her, saving her from a jump into SF Bay, and keeping her from jumping into the Pacific, Scottie is falling in love with her, the first time he has had such feelings.Scottie feels he needs to take Madeleine to the old mission 100 miles south of SF to free her of this possession, but instead she climbs up the mission bell tower, Scottie is unable to follow quickly enough, his vertigo holding him back, he hears a scream, sees what looks like Madeleine's body falling to the red tile roof below, dead. A quick inquest ruled it a suicide, the friend gets out of shipbuilding, travels, while Scottie tries to get over his great loss, his first ever love, includes a stay in a mental hospital.Not too long after, Scottie sees a woman remarkably similar to Madeleine walking to her residence, a hotel, he follows her, knocks on the door, she is dressed differently, has different color hair, a different personality, speaks differently, and says she is Judy, from Kansas, has lived there 3 years, even shows Scottie her ID to prove it. But Scottie has not gotten over Madeleine, is obsessed with recreating her, asks Judy to dress like her, get her hair colored, all the while Judy just wishes Scottie would like her for who she is, not because she looks like someone else. But she gets completely back to the Madeleine look, same clothes, same hair color.By now we have seen through Judy's flashback what is really going on. The wealthy husband had hired Judy to impersonate his wife, Madeleine, and had set up the incident at the mission so that he could shove the already dead wife off, Scottie would be the manipulated witness that she had climbed the stairs and jumped off, and after being paid off, Judy could resume her life. To her detriment, he also gave her the heirloom, Carlotta's necklace, and her wearing that is what got Scottie suspicious of the whole scheme. He catches on, brings Judy back to the mission, they climb to the bell, a nun approaches to see what is going on, Judy panics and falls to her death on the roof. Scottie no longer was in love with her, feeling lied to and manipulated, he has no emotion, but goes to the edge of the ledge and looks down, his vertigo gone. The emotional shock that Midge spoke of has cured him.The story is a tragedy of two lives that only through misfortune become intertwined, Scottie's and Judy's. He is not young, now retired, and had never found true love. In Madeliene he thinks he found it, only to be shocked then disillusioned when the full truth came out. When Judy died, he was back where the film started. Maybe Midge was the one after all. Judy was very flawed, enough to participate in a murder plot and feel no apparent guilt over it. All she wanted was to be loved by Scottie, but a relationship built on fraud has no chance, especially since Scottie was an honest man.James Stewart is known for his ability to play an ""everyman"" character, and is superb as Scottie. Kim Novak is a bigger mystery. She was not the first choice for the role, received it virtually by default, but after watching the movie it is hard to imagine anyone else playing the dual roles of Madeleine and Judy, she pulls it off so well. A big bonus is her commentary on the making-of extra, seeing her after all these years. She was only 24 when Vertigo was filmed, but she looked 40, a glamorous and beautiful 40. Actresses today who are 24 often still play teenagers.

,Hitchcock's most stunning achievement. A fascinating masterpiece which improves with each year and viewing.,"I get a bit tongue-tied talking about Hitchcock's greatest movies because they are just so remarkable, so astonishing, so entertaining, so multi-levelled, that it's very difficult to put into words what makes them great. Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and 'Vertigo', though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowning achievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it in any way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I see something new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did the previous viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star in Hollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of the best in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had always been superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic 'Rear Window' a few years prior to this, but he plays against type in 'Vertigo' and is jaw-droppingly good. It's difficult to remember now that 'Vertigo' is regarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of this had to do with Stewart's intense performance I think, and also the difficult subject matter. 'Vertigo' is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost as good as Stewart is Kim Novak ('The Man With The Golden Arm') in a role that she will always be remembered for. 'Vertigo' is a virtuoso piece from Hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it is that it is still wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest American movies. Simply astonishing.",hitchcocks most stunning achievement fascinating masterpiece which improves with each year viewing,i get bit tongue tied talking about hitchcocks greatest movies because they are just so remarkable so astonishing so entertaining so multi levelled that its very difficult put into words what makes them great hitchcock made some greatest movies ever made vertigo though by no means his most accessible film is quite possibly his crowning achievement it is without any doubt masterpiece i cannot fault it any way every time i watch it i am knocked out every time i see something new some nuance or moment that i appreciate more than i did previous viewing jimmy stewart one most popular movie star hollywood history gives remarkable performance throughout one best his career stewart had worked with hitchcock before had always been superb especially much copied suspense classic rear window few years prior this but he plays against type vertigo is jaw droppingly good its difficult remember now that vertigo is regarded as movie milestone that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released was relative failure hitchcock lot this had do with stewarts intense performance i think also difficult subject matter vertigo is essentially tale sexual obsession something most people were probably not expecting at time almost as good as stewart is kim novak man with golden arm role that she will always be remembered vertigo is virtuoso piece hitchcock movie that will no doubt continue inspire other film makers over years come however most important thing about it is that it is still wonderful viewing movie experience that you will never forget my mind it is one three four greatest american movies simply astonishing,0.6259832366215345,0.34102192134107034,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10.0,"A thriller of undeniable complexity, and impeccably acted and directed-Hitchcock's masterpiece!","I am a massive Hitchcock fan; this great director ain't called the Master of Suspense for nothing. Anyway, Vertigo is one of the truly great Hitchcocks. It is a thriller of undeniable complexity not only in plot but also in characterisation. It is implausible too i give you that. I will admit the first time I saw this, I didn't understand this, then again this is the sort of film that you need to see more than once. In all departments, this movie is a masterpiece and my all time favourite Hitchcock. For those who say this is the worst movie ever, you would beg to differ if you saw genuine crapfests like Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. They are a trillion times worse than this without a shadow of a doubt.What makes this movie great? When I re watched this, I got goosebumps. It is quite chilling, suspenseful and extremely haunting. The complex plot tells of a retired cop with a terror of heights who is hired by Gavin Elster to follow his suicidal wife. In the end, he falls in love with her but can't stop her falling to her death. Months later he sees a woman bearing strong resemblance to her, and is drawn into a web of deceit and obsession. There are so many strong moments here, especially Scotty following Madeline up the tower only to witness her falling to her death, but also of the San Francissco locations giving a dreamlike quality to an already dark and complex movie. The screenplay is sophisticated and sharp as well. And I have to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it was phenomenal, along with Miklos Rosza's score for Spellbound and Hermann's for Psycho this is the most memorable score in any Hitchcock film, and is guaranteed to have your hairs standing up on the back of your necks.The direction from Hitchcock is simply masterly. The cinematography isn't dated at all. It is stylish and full of contrasts of dark and bright colours, and is also very brooding and intense. I had very little problem with the film's pace and length; in fact let me rephrase that I had no problem with it. I felt actually that Torn Curtain had a much slower pace, and for me that film while good is one of my least favourite Hitchcock movies. The acting I thought was exceptional. Kim Novak starts off a little wooden, but she is certainly very beautiful and enigmatic. In the duel role of the suicidal wife and the woman bearing resemblance to her, she does an in general excellent job, considering both are extremely demanding roles. About James Stewart, whether he was a racist I don't know, but simply I don't care. Whether you are racist or not, it shouldn't matter when it comes to acting and films. What matters is that Stewart was a great actor who rarely gave a bad performance. In this film, he gives one of his best performances, shattering his Mister-Nice-Guy persona with a dark, brooding and truly complex characterisation. Barbara Bel Geddes also gives a terrific performance as Midge.All in all, a superb film, that deserves recognition as one of Hitchcock's best films. Seriously, it is one of the most effective depictions of romantic fatalism in all of cinema.

10.0,"Favorite Hitchcock and likely one of the most challenging, harrowing great films ever","Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is probably his most discussed film, and I believe that since it is so controversial- and yet living up to such hype by having a level of mystery, daring and true human interest that is open to interpretation- it gets better with every passing year. It deserves more credit than it gets (like most of Hitchcock's films) and though it is well credited with it's intrigue, I think that Psycho (not that it is a bad film) gets more credit than this film should get. There are at least a few reasons for this, arguably of course. One, the acting is spectacular including James Stewart in one of his very best turns as the weary, emotionally perplexed and obsessed cop with a slight fear of heights and a 'thing' for a certain 'dead' woman. Hitchcock's leading lady here Kim Novak, is equally interesting and ambiguous as the leading lady (or ladies). Two, the atmosphere Hicthcock invokes in this film is just right for the psychological tailspin that Stewart gets into, with the usage of lighting, real San Fransisco locations, and particularly the color green all to perfect, eerie effect. And three, there's Bernard Herrmann's score, on par with the Psycho score though maybe even better as a straight piece of classical music in the guise of tense, haunting movie music. It's also the kind of picture that is a MUST if you've already seen it, or even if not, and it comes around town on the big screen as all the images and dark scenes come into great view. Not one of the more outright 'fun' Hitchcock films, with the few chuckles plain comic relief, and maybe his best serious work.

5.0,"SPOILERS GALORE! If you've never seen the movie, DON'T READ this review!","I suppose this is some kind of masterpiece, what with the absolutely overwhelming photography, powerful score and all - but I must say I just couldn't get into it. We're made to be patient through a looooong exposition (Scottie following her around), which I didn't mind at first because I said, ""Hey it's Hitchcock - the payoff will be worth it."" Well, it wasn't. Scottie's obsession was inexplicable to me (and, yes, I realize that Kim Novak is hot); maybe the writing was weak in not giving him a strong and clear enough motivation for going over the edge (what were his other romantic attachments like? Why is *this* one in particular so extremely excessive? Knowing these things would help) or maybe it's just that I can't buy Jimmy Stewart in this type of role. He projects too much groundedness, dignity and common sense for him to be convincing as this kind of obsessional basket case (the scene with him in the asylum was particularly embarrassing and unconvincing; he doesn't look ""crazy"" - he looks like Jimmy Stewart just refusing to say his lines). Maybe an actor a bit more rumpled and on the edge - Robert Mitchum, say - could have brought the part off better (and I'm a *huge* Jimmy Stewart fan, just so you don't get the wrong idea).My biggest problem, however, is with the final third of the movie. Excuse me, but I just don't think it was a good idea to reveal the murder plot and its actual machinations two-thirds of the way into the film. Not knowing for certain up until the very end whether ""Judy"" was really ""Madeleine"" or whether Scottie was indeed just imagining things would have been much MUCH more effective. It would have pulled the viewer in, kept him guessing and psychologically on edge all the way through. Once you know that Scottie is ""correct"" in his assumption, not only is the tension gone and you're no longer immediately connected to the story, also you can't truly buy his craziness or obsession as a thematic point since, after all, he's ""right."" I believe this to be one of the all-time biggest scripting mistakes in the history of cinema. Hitchcock has said, though, that suspense is not what he was primarily after in this movie. He wanted to reveal the murder plot early so it wouldn't get in the way of the attention paid to Scottie's disintegration. But without the suspense, Scottie's disintegration just looks stupid. It's like the end of the movie has already come and gone, and yet the director is still forcing us to sit through a drawn-out and pointless epilogue that just takes foreeeeeever. . . And the ending - what's with that?! She sees a nun and so she jumps off the roof? It's absolutely RIDICULOUS - so abrupt and nonsensical, as if the editor suddenly told Hitchcock that he had to end the film RIGHT NOW, and he had to think of something fast. Clearly, the best ending (if the film had to go this long) would have been for her to slip off the edge, and then have Scottie try but fail to save her - thus mirroring his failure to save the cop at the beginning of the movie from falling, giving the whole thing a neat little symmetry. That Hitchcock failed to see the absolute rightness of this conclusion makes me wonder about his status as a cinematic genius.Well, ok, I won't go that far - Hitch's reputation is safe. But Vertigo's isn't; this is no masterpiece, and far from the director's greatest work. Instead, this is the one film where he deserted his ""popcorn"" approach to creating thrills and opted for a more pensive and ""mature"" style, thinking this would prove him the artist so many denied that he was. It does just the opposite - by playing down what he did best (building and sustaining suspense), Hitchcock is left rudderless, and his attempt at ""adult"" themes just look embarrassing. It's beautiful to look at, of course - one of the most sumptuous visual experiences in the entire history of movies. The redwoods scene, and the Golden Gate Bridge - fantastic! The scenes in the museum, too - absolutely ravishing. But, alas, great photography does not make a great movie. If only Vertigo were a coffee table book, then it might truly deserve the classic status it has been accorded. I don't know, I guess if you're a fan of the technical aspects of cinema, and love Hitchcock for his visual bravura and like to analyze his technique, there's probably a lot here for you to enjoy (and is no doubt why it's so loved by other directors). But if you're like me, and enjoy Hitchcock films for their pure ability to keep you tense and on the edge of your seat, Vertigo is not the film to watch.",spoilers galore if youve never seen movie dont read this review,i suppose this is some kind masterpiece what with absolutely overwhelming photography powerful score all but i must say i just couldnt get into it were made be patient through looooong exposition scottie following her around which i didnt mind at first because i said hey its hitchcock payoff will be worth it well it wasnt scotties obsession was inexplicable me yes i realize that kim novak is hot maybe writing was weak not giving him strong clear enough motivation going over edge what were his other romantic attachments like why is this one particular so extremely excessive knowing these things would help or maybe its just that i cant buy jimmy stewart this type role he projects too much groundedness dignity common sense him be convincing as this kind obsessional basket case scene with him asylum was particularly embarrassing unconvincing he doesnt look crazy he looks like jimmy stewart just refusing say his lines maybe actor bit more rumpled edge robert mitchum say could have brought part off better im huge jimmy stewart fan just so you dont get wrong idea my biggest problem however is with final third movie excuse me but i just dont think it was good idea reveal murder plot its actual machinations two thirds way into film not knowing certain up until very end whether judy was really madeleine or whether scottie was indeed just imagining things would have been much much more effective it would have pulled viewer kept him guessing psychologically edge all way through once you know that scottie is correct his assumption not only is tension gone youre no longer immediately connected story also you cant truly buy his craziness or obsession as thematic point since after all hes right i believe this be one all time biggest scripting mistakes history cinema hitchcock has said though that suspense is not what he was primarily after this movie he wanted reveal murder plot early so it wouldnt get way attention paid scotties disintegration but without suspense scotties disintegration just looks stupid its like end movie has already come gone yet director is still forcing us sit through drawn out pointless epilogue that just takes foreeeeeever ending whats with that she sees nun so she jumps off roof its absolutely ridiculous so abrupt nonsensical as if editor suddenly told hitchcock that he had end film right now he had think something fast clearly best ending if film had go this long would have been her slip off edge then have scottie try but fail save her thus mirroring his failure save cop at beginning movie falling giving whole thing neat little symmetry that hitchcock failed see absolute rightness this conclusion makes me wonder about his status as cinematic genius well ok i wont go that far hitchs reputation is safe but vertigos isnt this is no masterpiece far directors greatest work instead this is one film where he deserted his popcorn approach creating thrills opted more pensive mature style thinking this would prove him artist so many denied that he was it does just opposite by playing down what he did best building sustaining suspense hitchcock is left rudderless his attempt at adult themes just look embarrassing its beautiful look at course one most sumptuous visual experiences entire history movies redwoods scene golden gate bridge fantastic scenes museum too absolutely ravishing but alas great photography does not make great movie if only vertigo were coffee table book then it might truly deserve classic status it has been accorded i dont know i guess if youre fan technical aspects cinema love hitchcock his visual bravura like analyze his technique theres probably lot here you enjoy is no doubt why its so loved by other directors but if youre like me enjoy hitchcock films their pure ability keep you tense edge your seat vertigo is not film watch,0.5382073844030366,0.15877113526570047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,Falling In Love...Or Just Falling?,"Alfred Hitchcock made a career movie with ""Vertigo,"" one of several career movies of his, but maybe the most enduring. On the surface, it's a love story with a mystery, bright and shiny, maybe his most sumptuous feast of the senses. But it has a cold heart.James Stewart is the key to the film. I think a lot of people misjudge the film by misjudging his character, police detective John ""Scotty"" Ferguson. They see him and see the guy who played amiable dipso Elwood P. Dowd in ""Harvey"" or noble Mr. Smith or George Bailey. The secret of Scotty is he's no nice guy, though. He's more than a bit of a heel, a hard and greedy man eminently deserving of the roasting he gets in Henry Jones' postmortem. Watch Stewart in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" or the unjustly overlooked ""Carbine Williams,"" and you see the hardness Hitchcock was after, and got, from his lead here.Scotty does a lot of mean things in ""Vertigo,"" actions that feed his illness and lead to his doom. The character of Midge, subtly portrayed by Barbara Bel Geddes, is a key for understanding this. His casual stoking early on of Midge's flames of unreturned desire, especially when viewed in retrospect, burns through their happy banter and demonstrates how miserable a man he is, nowhere more brilliantly or ruthlessly than when he cuts her off from his life over a silly gag. Watch ""Vertigo"" more than once, and you may find yourself hating the guy as much as I do. But you still follow his path of doom with total sympathy; because of the elegant, enveloping way Hitchcock draws you into this world of passion, cut off from all bounds of propriety, even space and time.If Scotty was played by anyone other than Stewart, it's hard to imagine ""Vertigo"" packing the punch it does. You wouldn't have enough tolerance for the character to stick with his story. In its own day, ""Vertigo"" was a bit of a misfire, probably because audiences felt alienation from the Stewart image they were accustomed to. Yet now viewed from a decent remove, you get more of what Hitchcock was after, and respond to it better.Still, it's easy to understand people not liking ""Vertigo"" the first time they see it. At least that's true with me. I didn't like ""Vertigo"" the first time I saw it. Here's what helps you find the right handle. Fall in love with the wrong person. Become bitterly disappointed. See the one that you loved in the face of passersby, in odd places, and in your dreams. Then you begin to get it. Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes, as Billy Joel once sang, and trying to hold on too long is a recipe for self-inflicted pain.Talking too much about ""Vertigo"" is not a good idea. There's too many obvious spoilers in recounting the plot of the film, in explaining why Kim Novak is so flat-out stupendous in her performance, and how you are left feeling by film's end. ""Vertigo"" is a uniquely personal film, not only for Hitchcock, but for a broad array of viewers who like me have latched onto its tragic story.That's not to say it's perfect. There's a murder mystery wrapped up in ""Vertigo,"" and all the pieces don't exactly fit when you think about them later. Hitchcock called it ""icebox talk,"" something to leave the viewer pondering after the film was over, but maybe he left a few more loose ends than he should have this time around.Still, what ""Vertigo"" is after is not making sense but magic, and it succeeds wonderfully, nowhere more so then when it bends the laws of reality. Take the moment when the bookstore owner tells the sad tale of Carlotta Valdez while the lights of the room around him dim in eerie, unnatural sympathy. Or the way the flowers in the shop Madeleine visits seem to glow in unearthly splendor as Ferguson, his eyes glowing strangely too, spies on his prey.You may not like this film the first time you see it, but if you are left disturbed and uneasy from the experience, you owe it to yourself to see it again. ""Vertigo"" is a film that keeps on giving, with all the power and mystery of unrequited love, but unlike most forms of infatuation, this film has a way of returning the ardor with which it is held. Utterly timeless.",falling love or just falling,alfred hitchcock made career movie with vertigo one several career movies his but maybe most enduring surface its love story with mystery bright shiny maybe his most sumptuous feast senses but it has cold heart james stewart is key film i think lot people misjudge film by misjudging his character police detective john scotty ferguson they see him see guy who played amiable dipso elwood p dowd harvey or noble mr smith or george bailey secret scotty is hes no nice guy though hes more than bit heel hard greedy man eminently deserving roasting he gets henry jones postmortem watch stewart hitchcocks rope or unjustly overlooked carbine williams you see hardness hitchcock was after got his lead here scotty does lot mean things vertigo actions that feed his illness lead his doom character midge subtly portrayed by barbara bel geddes is key understanding this his casual stoking early midges flames unreturned desire especially when viewed retrospect burns through their happy banter demonstrates how miserable man he is nowhere more brilliantly or ruthlessly than when he cuts her off his life over silly gag watch vertigo more than once you may find yourself hating guy as much as i do but you still follow his path doom with total sympathy because elegant enveloping way hitchcock draws you into this world passion cut off all bounds propriety even space time if scotty was played by anyone other than stewart its hard imagine vertigo packing punch it does you wouldnt have enough tolerance character stick with his story its own day vertigo was bit misfire probably because audiences felt alienation stewart image they were accustomed yet now viewed decent remove you get more what hitchcock was after respond it better still its easy understand people not liking vertigo first time they see it at least thats true with me i didnt like vertigo first time i saw it heres what helps you find right handle fall love with wrong person become bitterly disappointed see one that you loved face passersby odd places your dreams then you begin get it life is series hellos goodbyes as billy joel once sang trying hold too long is recipe self inflicted pain talking too much about vertigo is not good idea theres too many obvious spoilers recounting plot film explaining why kim novak is so flat out stupendous her performance how you are left feeling by films end vertigo is uniquely personal film not only hitchcock but broad array viewers who like me have latched onto its tragic story thats not say its perfect theres murder mystery wrapped up vertigo all pieces dont exactly fit when you think about them later hitchcock called it icebox talk something leave viewer pondering after film was over but maybe he left few more loose ends than he should have this time around still what vertigo is after is not making sense but magic it succeeds wonderfully nowhere more so then when it bends laws reality take moment when bookstore owner tells sad tale carlotta valdez while lights room around him dim eerie unnatural sympathy or way flowers shop madeleine visits seem glow unearthly splendor as ferguson his eyes glowing strangely too spies his prey you may not like this film first time you see it but if you are left disturbed uneasy experience you owe it yourself see it again vertigo is film that keeps giving with all power mystery unrequited love but unlike most forms infatuation this film has way returning ardor with which it is held utterly timeless,0.5813917095562664,0.1034868085500997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,From among the dead...,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" has a narcotizing effect, a lulling, dream-like ambiance that is hard to shake off, which may explain why many viewers keep returning to it. It's also a strangely muted and anticlimactic film, posing yet another possible reason moviegoers watch it repeatedly: they hope (or need) to get more out of it the third or fourth time. Retired police detective James Stewart meets and makes over a woman who reminds him of his only true love--a suicidal woman he lost, but perhaps can find again by dipping back into the past. Hitchcock seemed to relate to Stewart's ""Scottie"" moreso than any other character in his films, and--having a gleeful touch of nastiness himself--is careful not to let him have his way. Glamour-mystery is gorgeous to take in, fascinatingly written and well-acted. Only one question: is the hotel manager (Ellen Corby) part of the scheme or just a dotty old broad? ***1/2 from ****",among dead,alfred hitchcocks vertigo has narcotizing effect lulling dream like ambiance that is hard shake off which may explain why many viewers keep returning it its also strangely muted anticlimactic film posing yet another possible reason moviegoers watch it repeatedly they hope or need get more out it third or fourth time retired police detective james stewart meets makes over woman who reminds him his only true love suicidal woman he lost but perhaps can find again by dipping back into past hitchcock seemed relate stewarts scottie moreso than any other character his films having gleeful touch nastiness himself is careful not let him have his way glamour mystery is gorgeous take fascinatingly written well acted only one question is hotel manager ellen corby part scheme or just dotty old broad 1 2,0.5114583333333333,0.11979166666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Get Lost in It.,"Along with ""Psycho"", Hitchcock's best film that wraps itself around the viewer very fast and never does let go. San Francisco detective Jimmy Stewart is slowly going crazy due to a failed mission which did not work because of his intense fear of heights. This is all front-page news of course and Stewart is shamed about the whole event. But a ray of light shines as he gets a job to watch a man's wife (Kim Novak) who is supposedly having an affair with another man. Stewart believes this is his chance to put the past behind him, but sometimes the future is even darker. Stewart falls in love with Novak and the love turns into a dark and twisted obsession that becomes deeper and deeper as the film progresses. When tragedy strikes, that is the end. Right? Not quite. An amazing screenplay and arguably Hitchcock's greatest directing venture make the film solid and Stewart's stunning performance raises the whole project to a classic level.

He looks and acts like a man obsessed, a readily identifiable hero battling with age and infirmity to recreate an impossible, lost love. Stewart is not only utterly credible, but engrossingly sympathetic. On the other hand, Kim Novak (in by far the best performance of her career - she replaced Hitch's first choice, Vera Miles, at short notice when Vera became pregnant) combines a brassily self-confident manner with an odd aura of vulnerability.

10.0,A Masterpiece of Obsession,"While pursuing a criminal on the roofs of the buildings in San Francisco, Detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) has a severe trauma when his partner falls off the roof trying to save him. He suffers from acrofobia and is retired from the police force, since his fear of heights provokes vertigo on him. He is contacted by the former mate from college Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who runs the shipyard of his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), and Gavin asks him to follow his wife. Gavin explains that she has an odd behavior and seems to be possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, having blanks of memory every now and then and presenting suicidal tendencies. The skeptical Scottie follows the beautiful blonde on the next morning: she buys some flowers and is drawn to places from the past related to Carlotta Valdes, visiting her grave in an ancient cemetery; staring her portrait for a long time in a museum; and finally moving to the Hotel McKittrick where Carlotta lived. In the end of the day, Scottie reports his findings to Gavin. When Madeleine jumps in the water of San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and brings her home. He has a crush on her and they fall in love for each other. When they go together to a mission outside San Francisco, Madeleine runs to the bell tower of the church and the disabled Scottie is unable to reach her; she jumps off the tower, committing suicide. There is a trial and the traumatized Scottie is interned with a breakdown. When he is discharged from the hospital, he meets the brunet seller Judy Barton by chance and her resemblance with Madeleine is amazing. Scottie approaches to Judy and expect to have a second chance in love until he sees a souvenir of a killing. ""Vertigo"" is a masterpiece of obsession of Alfred Hitchcock. The timeless complex story is perfect and full of suspense and psychological and sexual tensions. Kim Novak is extremely sexy and has an extraordinary performance in her double role and James Stewart is awesome as usual performing a charismatic character that becomes obsessed when he sees Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes performs an important support character that helps to develop James Stewart's character. The open conclusion is also excellent and the music score is also spectacular and gives a suspenseful touch of class to this film.

,A true Hitchcock classic; Stewart's gutsiest role,"VERTIGO (1958) **** James Stewart, Kim Novak, Barbara Bel Geddes, Tom Helmore, Henry Jones. Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of suspense and romantic obsession: Stewart (in one of his best go-against-the-grain performances) stars as San Francisco cop John 'Scottie' Ferguson, whose eponymous phobia leads him to an on-the-job lethal accident. Sitting out his time off from the force he's enlisted as a private eye to watch a friend's troubled wife Madeleine Elster (the ethereal Novak), who believes she has been reincarnated. Scottie's case leads to complications including the necropheliac emotional overhaul he succombs to after Madeleine's 'suicide' and seeing her in mystery woman Judy Barton (Novak again, proving to be an accomplished actress).More psychological underpinnings you could shake a stick at and thanks to The Master's multi-layered storyline the film never falters largely thanks to the incredibly affective cinematography by Robert Burks, the adaptation of Pieree Bouileau & Thomas Narcejaq's novel 'D'Entre les Morts' by Alec Coppel & Samuel Taylor and once again the excellent chemistry between the tormented Stewart and the bewitching Novak, proving to be one of the most passionate ill-fated couples in cinematic history. Perhaps the icing on the cake is the hauntingly evocative score by long-time collaborator Bernard Herrmann.
