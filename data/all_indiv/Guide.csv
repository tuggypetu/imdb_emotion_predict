,"Classic Indian drama of love, sacrifice, downfall, redemption","GUIDE (1965) is an unsung classic of Hindi cinema, starring major Bollywood star Dev Anand. It's a beautifully-produced modern love story and focuses on what happens when a tourist guide takes up with an ex-dancer who has been abandoned by her archaeologist husband and then guides her career as she becomes a musical star. It has much in common with classic Hollywood romantic musicals in the way it seamlessly incorporates songs and musical numbers into the action and charts the success of its female star. It adds to this rags-to-riches show biz story some characteristic Indian twists which give it greater scope and deeper meaning. Based on a novel by R.K. Narayan, GUIDE stars Anand as Raju, a glib, well-liked freelance tour guide who takes visitors, Indian and foreign, to historic sites around Delhi and tells them stories--some true, some embellished--about these magnificent places. When Raju takes Rosy (Waheeda Rehman), the ex-dancer, under his wing it causes a rift between him and his mother, friends and co-workers, so he leaves with Rosy and helps her to embark on a career as a singing and dancing performer. However, as Rosy achieves stardom, Raju falls into bad habits, palling around with the money men, drinking and gambling heavily. Eventually, he is arrested for forging a check and is sent to jail. When he gets out he starts life anew and wanders alone far and wide before winding up in a remote desert village where, thanks to the endless stream of pearls of wisdom he dispenses, he is taken as a holy man. In the midst of a terrible drought, he is compelled to embark on a fast so as not to disappoint the villagers who believe his fast will bring rain. All the while, Rosy and his mother are searching for him.The story is not told in quite this order. We first see Raju as he is getting out of jail and we first see Rosy as she begins her search for him. The story then unfolds in flashbacks from both his and Rosy's perspectives. If there is any flaw in the narrative structure, it is that the exploits of Raju in his reign as holy man, or ""swami,"" are given short shrift while the love story tends to bog down during the lovers' disillusion and drift apart. We needed to see more of Raju's life in the remote village. Given that the film is only 170 minutes (rather short for a Bollywood film), another half-hour of storytelling would not have hurt.Still, it is an accomplished work, boasting all the class, elegance and artistry of a classic Hollywood or European drama and few of the notable excesses of Bollywood films. It maintains a discreet cinematic distance that keeps the emotions in check while adding richer layers. There are songs and dances, but not too many, and they are all beautifully shot and staged, particularly the lavish, lengthy sequence showing Rosy's rise to stardom as a stage performer. The two leads, Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman, are both genuine movie stars in the classic sense and carry the film as well as any of their counterparts in other cinemas. Rehman, for one, has a presence which clearly recalls such Italian actresses as Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida. For those who are new to Bollywood, this film is a useful way to explore the roots of the Bollywood musicals that are finally attracting serious attention among film fans in the U.S.",classic indian drama love sacrifice downfall redemption,guide 1965 is unsung classic hindi cinema starring major bollywood star dev anand its beautifully produced modern love story focuses what happens when tourist guide takes up with ex dancer who has been abandoned by her archaeologist husband then guides her career as she becomes musical star it has much common with classic hollywood romantic musicals way it seamlessly incorporates songs musical numbers into action charts success its female star it adds this rags riches show biz story some characteristic indian twists which give it greater scope deeper meaning based novel by r k narayan guide stars anand as raju glib well liked freelance tour guide who takes visitors indian foreign historic sites around delhi tells them stories some true some embellished about these magnificent places when raju takes rosy waheeda rehman ex dancer under his wing it causes rift between him his mother friends co workers so he leaves with rosy helps her embark career as singing dancing performer however as rosy achieves stardom raju falls into bad habits palling around with money men drinking gambling heavily eventually he is arrested forging check is sent jail when he gets out he starts life anew wanders alone far wide before winding up remote desert village where thanks endless stream pearls wisdom he dispenses he is taken as holy man midst terrible drought he is compelled embark fast so as not disappoint villagers who believe his fast will bring rain all while rosy his mother are searching him story is not told quite this order we first see raju as he is getting out jail we first see rosy as she begins her search him story then unfolds flashbacks both his rosys perspectives if there is any flaw narrative structure it is that exploits raju his reign as holy man or swami are given short shrift while love story tends bog down during lovers disillusion drift apart we needed see more rajus life remote village given that film is only 170 minutes rather short bollywood film another half hour storytelling would not have hurt still it is accomplished work boasting all class elegance artistry classic hollywood or european drama few notable excesses bollywood films it maintains discreet cinematic distance that keeps emotions check while adding richer layers there are songs dances but not too many they are all beautifully shot staged particularly lavish lengthy sequence showing rosys rise stardom as stage performer two leads dev anand waheeda rehman are both genuine movie stars classic sense carry film as well as any their counterparts other cinemas rehman one has presence which clearly recalls such italian actresses as sophia loren gina lollobrigida those who are new bollywood this film is useful way explore roots bollywood musicals that are finally attracting serious attention among film fans u s,0.4014599116161616,0.1133068970959596,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,'Can there be any connection between one man's hunger and the rains?',"When I travelled from India to US this was the only Hindi movie DVD that I carried with me. To me this is a ""complete movie"", as a movie should be. It entertains me by taking me through a wide gamut of emotions, it stimulates me spiritually and philosophically (indian faith, western existentialism are all there) and it is technically brilliant.Each scene seems to be individually composed and you can see the effort that director vijay anand and his crew put in. Raju speaks to us in one of the scenes ""there is not much difference between me and you"". And as he speaks this you see the statue of Krishna in the background and Raju's index finger stretched as if holding a sudarshan chakra. Brilliant!!! Subtle things like these that you have to watch out for. The name ""Guide"" itself conveys a different meaning at different times in the movie; a railway guide, a personal guide and then a spiritual guide. It is very sad that a brilliant director like Vijay Anand could never come out of the shadows of Navketan and despite giving us some of the most important and influential movies of our times was ignored. People in west respect their classics and make an effort that Billy Wilder, Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Chaplin etc. are not forgotten. New directors openly admit how much they have been influenced by these people. But in India, what is not on MTV is not worth remembering. In another 10 years no one will remember Vijay Anand.",can there be any connection between one mans hunger rains,when i travelled india us this was only hindi movie dvd that i carried with me me this is complete movie as movie should be it entertains me by taking me through wide gamut emotions it stimulates me spiritually philosophically indian faith western existentialism are all there it is technically brilliant each scene seems be individually composed you can see effort that director vijay anand his crew put raju speaks us one scenes there is not much difference between me you as he speaks this you see statue krishna background rajus index finger stretched as if holding sudarshan chakra brilliant subtle things like these that you have watch out name guide itself conveys different meaning at different times movie railway guide personal guide then spiritual guide it is very sad that brilliant director like vijay anand could never come out shadows navketan despite giving us some most important influential movies our times was ignored people west respect their classics make effort that billy wilder hitchcock orson welles chaplin etc are not forgotten new directors openly admit how much they have been influenced by these people but india what is not mtv is not worth remembering another 10 years no one will remember vijay anand,0.49077733860342554,0.11534914361001317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,One of a kind,"The book was penned by an ace novelist by the name of R.K.Narayan, who wrote the story surrounding a small village in North India. The director was Vijay Anand younger brother of Dev Anand, who reluctantly accepted the task and changed the location to Udaipur, also called the Pink City, for its ornate pink palaces and now a tourist mecca. The partnership was called Navketan International. Navketan International even handled the advertising for this movie, which was pioneering and unique even for the '60s. The actor playing ""Raju"" was none other than,Devdutt Pishorimal Anand, Aka Dev Anand, Evergreen Anand, Dev Saab, an English major who trekked his way to Bombay (now Mumbai) the ""Hollywood"" of India now inaptly titled ""Bollywood"". Dev Anand was accepted by the Indian moviegoers instantly since he had chiseled features (mixture of Gregory Peck & Rock Hudson!)wore hats at a rakish angle,walked sort of sideways! and spoke Hindi with a clipped and poetic accent. Being handsome compared to some actors who were cherubic! didn't do any harm either. Dev Anand, who started his career in 1946, went on to act in over 100 movies in a span of fifty years, now an octogenarian, writer, producer,director of movies OF which, less said is better!But If there was one movie that was reflective of the confluent talent that was prevalent in Indian cinema of the '60s and '70s, it had to be ""Guide"". Dev Anand is not an actor in the sense of acting talent like Raj Kapoor or Rajendra Kumar(Sangam) but he got away because of his good looks. Where as Waheeda Rahman, was the Liz Taylor for looks and Merryl Streep for acting in Indian cinema. The part of ""Rosie"" was sculpted for her. She was a noted classical dancer. She too was reluctant in accepting the part that had, lot of insinuations and was considered a bad career move. Accepted she did and the rest is history, a cinematic masterpiece caught in Eastman color by cinematographer Jal Mistry. There is a scene, where, Raju (Dev Anand,) is drunk and sings his heart and soul to Rosie (Waheeda Rahman) who has emotions crushed between a pillow and she walks down the stairs and their hands meet between rails. This was the master director Vijay Anand at work using haunting melody of music that was the staple of great music directors like ""Dada"" Sachin Dev Burman, whose music will linger for ever.

10.0,One of the ten greatest Indian Movies Ever,"Guide is an impeccable work of art, not simply a movie. I see it as a lifetime achievement for all those who were a part of it,not intending to undermine their other accomplishments.Vijay Anand,popularly called Goldie(movie director),shows his class and commitment to prove himself even when the English version of the movie directed by Ted Danielewski failed earlier.It was a just a five minute song that Yash Johar(PRO for production) showed to the distributors before they were convinced that the movie is a classic.The photography,art direction and production of the movie sets it apart from other movies of its era and at the same time puts it right up there on a different level.I would say that GUIDE is the soul of Indian Cinema and serves as an inspiration to many. For all those who doubt the talent and originality of Dev Anand(Raju), this is the answer. Waheeda Rehman(Rosie) has herself confessed that Guide was the best ever role that she performed. S D Burman's heart rendering music and Vijay Anand's vision have made this a landmark accomplishment for Indian Cinema.",one ten greatest indian movies ever,guide is impeccable work art not simply movie i see it as lifetime achievement all those who were part it not intending undermine their other accomplishments vijay anand popularly called goldie movie director shows his class commitment prove himself even when english version movie directed by ted danielewski failed earlier it was just five minute song that yash johar pro production showed distributors before they were convinced that movie is classic photography art direction production movie sets it apart other movies its era at same time puts it right up there different level i would say that guide is soul indian cinema serves as inspiration many all those who doubt talent originality dev anand raju this is answer waheeda rehman rosie has herself confessed that guide was best ever role that she performed s d burmans heart rendering music vijay anands vision have made this landmark accomplishment indian cinema,0.42403273809523806,0.22202380952380954,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.52, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.3}"

Hats off to Narayan , Vijay Anand and Dev Anand. Not to forget S.D Burman Da 's music. This is a thought provoking movie. It, has the power to arouse the sub-conscious ethical senses. All the new directors have to learn a lot from this movie. Movie making is not just copying Hollywood. You can proudly say that Guide is a Hindi movie.... made in India.

8.0,"A classic tale effectively adapted to the screen, with great writing, music and performances","Based on R.K. Narayan's famous novel, The Guide, Vijay Anand's Guide is a doubtless classic of Hindi movies. In a way, the movie broke tradition by presenting a relationship between a simple man who works as a guide and an unhappily-married woman he assists. The film's most remarkable feat is the lack of over-perfection. The characters are devoid of any heroic qualities. They are, like everybody else, flawed and imperfect people who have their ups and downs, and not typical self-sacrificing figures. The first scene when Dev Anand's Raju is released from prison made me predict that in typical Hindi-film style, he was actually there for no reason and was probably accused for no fault of his own. After all we are so used to seeing movies in which the lead characters are imprisoned either because they sacrificed themselves for somebody else or because they were deceived. Here Raju really did commit a crime. It's interesting how the story moves through several ironic turns. In the first half we see that Waheeda Rehman's Rosie is emotionally dependant on Raju as in him she finds a friend and confidant, and he is the one who inspires her to fight for her dignity and is her only support system. Later in the film, the story turns over when, with the help of Raju, Rosie achieves fame as a dancer. She is stronger, and feels more confident. There we see that it is actually Raju who is dependant on her, both emotionally and financially. He loses himself to drinking and gambling and is an altogether different person. Well, so is she, and that's what gives us a fascinating look at the complexity of their relationship. The second half is, by my estimation, much stronger than the first, but that's a good thing (the trouble is when it's the other way around). In many ways, the second half, namely the parts showing the conflict in Raju and Rosie's new life as a couple, is reminiscent of many classic Hollywood pictures involving relationships. The narrative structure is done well, never daring to torture the audience and instead making everything easy to follow despite many complex proceedings. Yes, there are moments which I felt were unnecessary and the film may be quite overlong, but otherwise it is well-edited although, of course, it is more a case of good storytelling, and due credit for the consistency goes to Vijay Anand for writing such a good script and directing it so well. The dialogue is for the most part excellent - it is rich and meaningful, and it's easy to see why many of the film's lines are famous to this today. They bring depth to the story and never sound cheesy or corny, just very appropriate and convincing. The film is also one of the most remarkable cinematographic achievements of the times, and the colour cinematography makes for an easy watch. The music, by S.D. Burman, is sublime, and rightfully each song is considered a classic. The songs are executed with impressive energy and colour, they never feel out of place, and are all situationally relevant as they enhance the meaning of the story. My favourite number is of course the highly popular ""Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai"", just because I saw it as an uninhibited celebration of the human spirit, and it is just an exhilarating and joyful number.Raju and Rosie have been known as iconic characters, and due credit for this must go to the actors, though they are well written. Dev Anand, as already mentioned, plays an imperfect man who is still rather classy as a character and it is a demanding part for any actor. This is the role of a lifetime for this popular actor, he sinks his teeth into it, and delivers. He is convincing even in the most crucial moments, where a lesser actor could have failed, and brings character to Raju. Waheeda Rehman shines as the conflicted Rosie, in a performance that, in spite of being so restrained, conveys so much of her inner pain and dissatisfaction from life. Her transformation is very convincing, as later in the film we see an altogether different woman, who is indifferent to her surroundings and to Raju as well. It never looks peculiar, where it could have because we saw a much more warm side of her character early in the movie. It goes without saying that her dance numbers are simply superb - they are some of the best portions of the film and they contribute significantly to the building of her character. Each one of them constitutes an expression of her state of mind, whether happy or tormented, and there is a certain fervour in her expressions and moves that explosively brings out her otherwise repressed energy and emotion. Anand and Rehman are supported by several actors who provide strong support even if not all of them are great actors. Kishore Sahu is good as Marco, Rosie's ignorant husband, although he has several weak moments. The glorious Leela Chitnis is wonderful as Raju's loving mother. Guide is a great film, though I would never call it flawless. In all fairness I found myself disappointed a bit with the conclusion of the story although I did see the redemptive tone of the ending. It is of course handled very well, but the chapter where Raju is mistaken as a holy man just didn't work for me as much despite the spiritual side of it. I still appreciate Guide and believe that fans of Hindi movies, and even foreigners who have not seen Indian movies, will enjoy this movie. It is a fine dramatic musical, and all I think is left to say is well-done.",classic tale effectively adapted screen with great writing music performances,based r k narayans famous novel guide vijay anands guide is doubtless classic hindi movies way movie broke tradition by presenting relationship between simple man who works as guide unhappily married woman he assists films most remarkable feat is lack over perfection characters are devoid any heroic qualities they are like everybody else flawed imperfect people who have their ups downs not typical self sacrificing figures first scene when dev anands raju is released prison made me predict that typical hindi film style he was actually there no reason was probably accused no fault his own after all we are so used seeing movies which lead characters are imprisoned either because they sacrificed themselves somebody else or because they were deceived here raju really did commit crime its interesting how story moves through several ironic turns first half we see that waheeda rehmans rosie is emotionally dependant raju as him she finds friend confidant he is one who inspires her fight her dignity is her only support system later film story turns over when with help raju rosie achieves fame as dancer she is stronger feels more confident there we see that it is actually raju who is dependant her both emotionally financially he loses himself drinking gambling is altogether different person well so is she thats what gives us fascinating look at complexity their relationship second half is by my estimation much stronger than first but thats good thing trouble is when its other way around many ways second half namely parts showing conflict raju rosies new life as couple is reminiscent many classic hollywood pictures involving relationships narrative structure is done well never daring torture audience instead making everything easy follow despite many complex proceedings yes there are moments which i felt were unnecessary film may be quite overlong but otherwise it is well edited although course it is more case good storytelling due credit consistency goes vijay anand writing such good script directing it so well dialogue is most part excellent it is rich meaningful its easy see why many films lines are famous this today they bring depth story never sound cheesy or corny just very appropriate convincing film is also one most remarkable cinematographic achievements times colour cinematography makes easy watch music by s d burman is sublime rightfully each song is considered classic songs are executed with impressive energy colour they never feel out place are all situationally relevant as they enhance meaning story my favourite number is course highly popular aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hai just because i saw it as uninhibited celebration human spirit it is just exhilarating joyful number raju rosie have been known as iconic characters due credit this must go actors though they are well written dev anand as already mentioned plays imperfect man who is still rather classy as character it is demanding part any actor this is role lifetime this popular actor he sinks his teeth into it delivers he is convincing even most crucial moments where lesser actor could have failed brings character raju waheeda rehman shines as conflicted rosie performance that spite being so restrained conveys so much her inner pain dissatisfaction life her transformation is very convincing as later film we see altogether different woman who is indifferent her surroundings raju as well it never looks peculiar where it could have because we saw much more warm side her character early movie it goes without saying that her dance numbers are simply superb they are some best portions film they contribute significantly building her character each one them constitutes expression her state mind whether happy or tormented there is certain fervour her expressions moves that explosively brings out her otherwise repressed energy emotion anand rehman are supported by several actors who provide strong support even if not all them are great actors kishore sahu is good as marco rosies ignorant husband although he has several weak moments glorious leela chitnis is wonderful as rajus loving mother guide is great film though i would never call it flawless all fairness i found myself disappointed bit with conclusion story although i did see redemptive tone ending it is course handled very well but chapter where raju is mistaken as holy man just didnt work me as much despite spiritual side it i still appreciate guide believe that fans hindi movies even foreigners who have not seen indian movies will enjoy this movie it is fine dramatic musical all i think is left say is well done,0.5259953009953009,0.26923631923631924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,One of Indian cinema's best,"In India, this movie is considered a textbook for directing films. I would say it's a textbook for acting, editing, song-writing, and music direction. If Vijay Anand's direction made this movie a classic, S.D. Burman's music made it unforgettable.Of course, before the movie came R.K. Narayan's story of Raju, the guide; a story that lent its honesty to the film: The protagonist is not infallible, he is human. He doesn't get everything right. He is not loved by everybody. He cheats, albeit in love, and pays the price. He attempts to cheat again when he tries to run away from the village where he is being considered a saint and is being expected to fast for rain. That's when he realizes he has run enough attains peace.Without going any more into some of the more abstract reasons this is my all-time favorite film, I'll point out some of the more obvious. Only the genius of S.D. Burman could create ""Din Dhal Jaaye"", ""Tere Mere Sapne"", and ""Piya Tose Naina Laage Re"" - all for the same film! It is rumored that R.D. Burman ghost-composed some of the songs (especially ""Aaj Phir Jeene Ki"") as his father had taken ill at some critical point in the film. Regardless of which Burman did it, I am thankful for what he did.Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman are two of my most favorite actors. With this movie, Dev Anand silenced his critics.

10.0,An outstanding story about a frivolous but lovable chap called Raju,"Undoubtedly, one of the finest examples of film-making.This film is an absolutely original, Indian story, and does not owe anything to the west.Every aspect of the film is top-notch. The songs(each one, a masterpiece) blend so beautifully with the sequences, that one is convinced that the film would be incomplete without the songs.Adapted from the novel written by RK Narayan, the film explores the adventures and misadventures of the happy-go-lucky tourist guide, Raju(played by Dev Anand).The film moves on to the next level with the beginning of a love affair between Raju and a danseuse named Rosy(Waheeda Rehman) who is already married, but is discontented because her archaeologist husband doesn't really give a damn about her.The husband (Kishore Sahu) is shown to be deeply engrossed in the caves of Udaipur(the city where Raju is famously called ""Raju guide"")However, there is hardly any intimate scene between Raju and Rosy (later christened Nalini, in the film) and their feelings for each other are depicted in a very subtle manner. The characterization is so good that we sympathize with Rosy, rather than condemning her for having an extra marital affair....What happens next and what awaits Raju and Rosy is what the film is all about.

9.0,Vijay Anand's Best movie,"I watched Guide around eight years ago and my memory fails me a bit. But so strong is the movie that it has left a strong impression on me. Some events of this comment might be a little off the mark but overall it is a true attempt.Guide is popular director Vijay Anad's best remembered movie. The movie won both critical acclaim and good box office sales. Based on acclaimed Indian novelist (of Malgudi Days fame) K R Narayan's book ""The Guide"", Guide is the story of two people Raju (Dev Anand) and Rosy (Waheeda Rehman) and there flaws. While Raju is a enthusiastic young tourist guide, Rosy is the cheerless, forlorn wife of an architect Marco. The setting is the scenic city of Udaipur (known for the lake palace). Marco is much older than Rosi and it is quite evident that the married life is not going smooth. Marco is more interested in the motionless wall sculptures of the caves he is studying with Raju's help, than in his wife.At heart Rosy is a girl. When she meets Raju the guide she blossoms into her true self (thanks to a suicide attempt Raju saved her from). Raju encourages her to develop her individuality - live her own life independent of Marco (who to add to his evil outlook is shown as a heavy drinker). The song ""Aaj fir Jine Ki Tamanna Hai"" based on Rosi (sung by Lata Mangeshkar) roughly translates to ""(Today) I want to live again.."" The songs effectively portrays both Rosi's suppressed energy and her quest for freedom. Rosi is interested in dancing something her husband wont allow her to do. Thanks to all the support she gets from Raju, she falls in love with him.In 1960's Hindu society such a relationship was definitely unacceptable - Even in Cinema. To show a relationship outside the sanctity of married life was a bold move. It required Director Vijay Anand's abilities to portray it and still win acclaim and viewer ship. It also required Waheeda Rehman's abilities at acting to be sanctimonious in spite of living outside her marriage.Raju and Rosie marry and now starts ""..sadly ever after..""Rosi can now freely realize her dream as a dancer from Raju's support. During the classical music influenced ""Piya tau see naina laage re"" we see Rosi's rise in fame as a dancer. As Rosi becomes a popular dancer, Raju get more irresponsible. Acrimony creeps into their relationship because of Raju's jealousy and his sudden habit of drinking and signs a fraudulent cheque.The guide looses his own track.. only to seek it again as a hermit..The movie starts with ""Wahan Kaun hai Tera, Musafir, Jayega Kahan?"" sung by SD Burman (where will you go, oh traveler, you know no one there.) The song sets us up for the movie's philosophical tone. Guide has no heroes or blacks and whites every character has a spectrum of good and bad sides. The last and final song of the movie is a duel song ""Mohse chhal kiye jaye"" sung by Rosi and ""Kya se kya ho gaya bewafa"" by Raju present both there arguments. It is only near the end that Raju becomes a chance hero. Some villagers assume he is a saint and Raju forgets who he is and probably because he wants to pay penance for his mistakes, he starts to believe in his new life.Vijay Anand went on to see more success at box office with his thrillers. But Guide remains his best movie. A Classic, Guide swept the Filmfare awards - winning 7 Filmfares, best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Story, Dialogue and Cinematography. I wonder how on earth did it miss the Filmfares for its music.**spoiler warning** 'Guide' is a celebration of a ""flawed"" character who seeks love, pain, redemption and death. ******",vijay anands best movie,i watched guide around eight years ago my memory fails me bit but so strong is movie that it has left strong impression me some events this comment might be little off mark but overall it is true attempt guide is popular director vijay anads best remembered movie movie won both critical acclaim good box office sales based acclaimed indian novelist malgudi days fame k r narayans book guide guide is story two people raju dev anand rosy waheeda rehman there flaws while raju is enthusiastic young tourist guide rosy is cheerless forlorn wife architect marco setting is scenic city udaipur known lake palace marco is much older than rosi it is quite evident that married life is not going smooth marco is more interested motionless wall sculptures caves he is studying with rajus help than his wife at heart rosy is girl when she meets raju guide she blossoms into her true self thanks suicide attempt raju saved her raju encourages her develop her individuality live her own life independent marco who add his evil outlook is shown as heavy drinker song aaj fir jine ki tamanna hai based rosi sung by lata mangeshkar roughly translates today i want live again songs effectively portrays both rosis suppressed energy her quest freedom rosi is interested dancing something her husband wont allow her do thanks all support she gets raju she falls love with him 1960s hindu society such relationship was definitely unacceptable even cinema show relationship outside sanctity married life was bold move it required director vijay anands abilities portray it still win acclaim viewer ship it also required waheeda rehmans abilities at acting be sanctimonious spite living outside her marriage raju rosie marry now starts sadly ever after rosi can now freely realize her dream as dancer rajus support during classical music influenced piya tau see naina laage re we see rosis rise fame as dancer as rosi becomes popular dancer raju get more irresponsible acrimony creeps into their relationship because rajus jealousy his sudden habit drinking signs fraudulent cheque guide looses his own track only seek it again as hermit movie starts with wahan kaun hai tera musafir jayega kahan sung by sd burman where will you go oh traveler you know no one there song sets us up movies philosophical tone guide has no heroes or blacks whites every character has spectrum good bad sides last final song movie is duel song mohse chhal kiye jaye sung by rosi kya se kya ho gaya bewafa by raju present both there arguments it is only near end that raju becomes chance hero some villagers assume he is saint raju forgets who he is probably because he wants pay penance his mistakes he starts believe his new life vijay anand went see more success at box office with his thrillers but guide remains his best movie classic guide swept filmfare awards winning 7 filmfares best movie director actor actress story dialogue cinematography i wonder how earth did it miss filmfares its music spoiler warning guide is celebration flawed character who seeks love pain redemption death,0.4768091361374944,0.22246155585707827,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,"A stunning Story About Love, Sacrifice, Fall from Grace and Redemption","Based on an acclaimed novel, 'Guide' takes us through a journey guided by the protagonists Raju (Anand) and Rosie (Rehman). Simply said, the story is about Raju, the tourist guide, who falls in love with an amateur dancer, Rosie, who's married to an archaeologist. Dance is Rosie's passion but due to her husband's discontent, she gives it up in the hope to please him and remain be devoted. Eventually, he abandons her and she seeks solace in Raju's companionship. Raju encourages her to follow her passion. However, the neighborhood, his family and friends object to their relationship and the fact that she's living in his house. Even his mother leaves him. With the help of Raju, Rosie becomes a successful dancer and a star while Raju spends the earnings on gambling, drinking and other such dealings. Rosie, though somewhat bothered by Raju's bad habits, she somehow tolerates them. Stardom has never been her ambition and she continues her dance only for the passion. Then, when Rosie's ex-husband makes his entry, it becomes too much for Raju to handle and here things change from bad to worse.The story isn't told in chronological order but due to brilliant writing and Anand's direction, it is easy to follow and keeps us engaged as the events unfold proving once again that Anand is one of the greater storytellers. The songs are among the memorable classics (beautiful lyrics) that are spectacularly picturised (thanks to the amazing cinematography and the dazzling locations) and support the narration. The characters are so brilliantly written with different layers showing us very real human beings. None of them are perfect and very easily relatable.Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman have acted together in a number of films, yet 'Guide' remains the most memorable film as their chemistry is simply electrifying. Not surprisingly, the characters Raju and Rosie have been immortalized by the two fabulous leads. Dev Anand as Raju delivers his best performance, while Waheeda Rehman as Rosie underplays her part to near perfection and portrays Rosie with élan and I loved her expressions in the song just before Raju is arrested.Finally, 'Guide' remains one of my favorite classics that I'll recommend to anyone. In my humble opinion it is one that will surprise you with it's storytelling and characters and one that will stay in your brave brain for quite some time.",stunning story about love sacrifice fall grace redemption,based acclaimed novel guide takes us through journey guided by protagonists raju anand rosie rehman simply said story is about raju tourist guide who falls love with amateur dancer rosie whos married archaeologist dance is rosies passion but due her husbands discontent she gives it up hope please him remain be devoted eventually he abandons her she seeks solace rajus companionship raju encourages her follow her passion however neighborhood his family friends object their relationship fact that shes living his house even his mother leaves him with help raju rosie becomes successful dancer star while raju spends earnings gambling drinking other such dealings rosie though somewhat bothered by rajus bad habits she somehow tolerates them stardom has never been her ambition she continues her dance only passion then when rosies ex husband makes his entry it becomes too much raju handle here things change bad worse story isnt told chronological order but due brilliant writing anands direction it is easy follow keeps us engaged as events unfold proving once again that anand is one greater storytellers songs are among memorable classics beautiful lyrics that are spectacularly picturised thanks amazing cinematography dazzling locations support narration characters are so brilliantly written with different layers showing us very real human beings none them are perfect very easily relatable dev anand waheeda rehman have acted together number films yet guide remains most memorable film as their chemistry is simply electrifying not surprisingly characters raju rosie have been immortalized by two fabulous leads dev anand as raju delivers his best performance while waheeda rehman as rosie underplays her part near perfection portrays rosie with lan i loved her expressions song just before raju is arrested finally guide remains one my favorite classics that ill recommend anyone my humble opinion it is one that will surprise you with its storytelling characters one that will stay your brave brain quite some time,0.6614989177489178,0.26185606060606065,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,Guide is about losing and finding your way in life,"Guide is a transcendental movie about finding (or losing) your way, and finding it again. At one level it is purely corporeal  about life's search for fame, fortune and love; but at a meta-level it asks: what are we really searching for? Just fame, fortune, love? Or is it altruism, God, or something even bigger than that? Guide looks for answers to nothing less that the deepest and toughest questions of life.Guide is about the many paradoxical situations of life. A village looks for guidance from a man, who is lost himself. A girl, who is trying to find freedom from her seedy background, finds imprisonment in a loveless marriage. A woman and a man dream of a successful future together, but are disenchanted and separated by the very same future they built together. Guide explores these situations subtly and honestly. True to reality, life itself is the protagonist and life itself is the villain; and the characters are but parts of a universe that is trying to comprehend itself through them.Unlike much of Bollywood fare, this movie has rich characters and strong character development. The main characters truly evolve through the movie. Vijay Anand's dialogs are excellent and express emotions as honestly as few movies have. A few scenes really stand out  one where Rosie and Raju, penniless, pretend to be a famous artiste and her eager fan; another where Rosie, sadly alienated from her lover says ""there is a wall around my heart, and it seems like nothing can reach inside it  not happiness, not sadness"".Last but not least, the songs are a delight and they only enhance the depth of the story. When Rosie tastes, for a day, the freedom she craves, we sing with her ""I feel like living again"". On our journey with Raju and Rosie, when they feel the cozy warmth of love and togetherness, we feel like singing ""the colors of our dreams are now the same""; when they feel sad loneliness, we lament ""the day ends, but alas, the night lasts forever"".Guide is a great human drama, but what elevates it to an epic is the mystical undercurrent to the story. Sophisticated and progressive for a Bollywood movie made in 1965, Guide is a timeless masterpiece and very few Bollywood movies made before or since come close in scope, ambition and depth. It swept most major awards in 1965 (except, shockingly, for Best Music  which was won by Suraj), and will probably be a strong contender for these awards in any other year.",guide is about losing finding your way life,guide is transcendental movie about finding or losing your way finding it again at one level it is purely corporeal about lifes search fame fortune love but at meta level it asks what are we really searching just fame fortune love or is it altruism god or something even bigger than that guide looks answers nothing less that deepest toughest questions life guide is about many paradoxical situations life village looks guidance man who is lost himself girl who is trying find freedom her seedy background finds imprisonment loveless marriage woman man dream successful future together but are disenchanted separated by very same future they built together guide explores these situations subtly honestly true reality life itself is protagonist life itself is villain characters are but parts universe that is trying comprehend itself through them unlike much bollywood fare this movie has rich characters strong character development main characters truly evolve through movie vijay anands dialogs are excellent express emotions as honestly as few movies have few scenes really stand out one where rosie raju penniless pretend be famous artiste her eager fan another where rosie sadly alienated her lover says there is wall around my heart it seems like nothing can reach inside it not happiness not sadness last but not least songs are delight they only enhance depth story when rosie tastes day freedom she craves we sing with her i feel like living again our journey with raju rosie when they feel cozy warmth love togetherness we feel like singing colors our dreams are now same when they feel sad loneliness we lament day ends but alas night lasts forever guide is great human drama but what elevates it epic is mystical undercurrent story sophisticated progressive bollywood movie made 1965 guide is timeless masterpiece very few bollywood movies made before or since come close scope ambition depth it swept most major awards 1965 except shockingly best music which was won by suraj will probably be strong contender these awards any other year,0.4957520325203252,0.17154761904761906,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Wahan kaun hai tera? Musafir!! Jayega kahan?,"Raju(Dev Anand) is a smart man from a small town. He knows many Indian languages, is hard working and owner of a railway shop but he rents his shop and chooses to work as a guide. Circumstances changes and at work he gets involved with an archaeologist's neglected wife Rosy(Waheeda Rahman). He ends up helping her, against the will of his mother, separate from her husband and become a world class dancer. Raju becomes a very rich and successful man as her lover and secretary. Raju cant handle his success and ends up in a jail under the charges of forgery. Free from jail Raju decides to travel as an anonymous soul and is mistaken for a 'mahatma' by simple villagers. Raju's inner conflict and cosmic conflicts becomes one as a mad villager by mistake set hesitant Raju sail on philosophical voyage.The film is based on a novel by RK Narayan which is as good as the film. 'Guide' is the best Indian film by any standard or scale. It is a sure Oscar winner. Graph of the character 'Raju' is unimaginably big. There is just no connection between where it starts from and where it reaches finally although he remains a 'guide' throughout. This is one of those films which changes you as a man. This film is flawless. Pace is fast and non linear. It keeps going back and forth in flashbacks but narration is tight. I think this film is the essence of most Indian philosophies like 'Atma' (soul), Parmatma (supreme soul of perfect consciousness), Tapasya (austerity), Moksha (liberation) etc. Last 30 minutes deals with philosophical questions like 'Is there God?', 'are we being watched?' etc. There are lots of things in the film which is not in the novel including the ending which I think is the most important factor of the graph of the character. Dev Anand is brilliant in this film. This is definitely the best film of most of the cast and crew except for may be SD Burman. Though as a soundtrack this is SD's best too. Background music is filled with flute pieces and sitar which works great to set the mood for a grand philosophical finale. 'wahan Kaun Hai Tera' is probably one of the best video I can think of. In the song people throw money at sleeping Raju considering him a beggar. In the next frame he leans on a tree and cries like a child and then runs like hell. This song beats any choreography I have seen in my life including 'Anand' and 'Pyasa'. The transformation of a common man to 'mahatma' is RK Narayan's genius which Goldy Anand has very neatly transported onto celluloid screen. By the way this film is considered a bible from the filmmkinh point of view. You can imagine if its the best of Goldy 'God' Anand himself. If you are an Indian and you like films and you have not seen this film then you are like VP Singh who had not heard of Bachchan until 1983 :>.

9.0,Art!,"This is one of the seminal movies in the history of Bollywood, one of its very best - like the characters it portrays it's flawed but completely fascinating and compelling. And with music and lyrics by S. D. Burman and Shailendra vocals mainly by Rafi and Lata complemented by incessantly inventive camera-work and direction and sets in the very best '60's tradition you have something special.And there's a gripping roller-coaster script too: Dev Anand as Raju is released from prison for forgery, goes to a small village and inadvertently becomes the villagers swami while his story comes out in flashback. He was a slick-talking guide for a rich man who (just like a fool) didn't love his younger beautiful wife Rosie played by Waheeda Rehman who in turn loved dancing and Raju helped set up her career as a stage performer and fell in love with her and – well, far more to it than just that. The characterisations are fairly deep but episodic as style was definitely preferred over substance by director Vijay Anand – and the Style is relentless, continually restless cameras and snappy movement on screen to streams of audio interpolation or character interplay or invective means attention must be paid, right from the start. The songs are beautiful and more important than usual because they're integral to the plot. Even Waheeda ecstatically dancing by herself carried a wealth of information and plot development. Out of such a great selection my favourites were Piya Tose Naina Laage Re and Saiyaan Beimaan both sung by Lata with their colourful sets and costumes and vibrant dance routines – in fact they're two of my favourite Lata songs ever; the stately Gaata Rahe Mere Dil duet by Kishore Kumar and Lata always sticks in my mind afterwards. And Aaj Phir Jeene was voted 12th Bollywood movie song of all-time by listeners to UK BBC Asian Network in 2013. The song lyrics are beautiful but the dialogue is also wise – life and death may be illusions as averred by Raju's soul but this surely is fact!Dev said people thought him mad for pursuing with this Hindi version when an English one had flopped, and there was a cool initial reaction to the film when it was released. For those wishing for the first time for a view of Olde Bollywood, start here. This proper version is nearly three hours long and yet still leaves you thinking that there could have been more and was it rushed, just like real life. Not perfect, what is - but once seen, never forgotten.",art,this is one seminal movies history bollywood one its very best like characters it portrays its flawed but completely fascinating compelling with music lyrics by s d burman shailendra vocals mainly by rafi lata complemented by incessantly inventive camera work direction sets very best 60s tradition you have something special theres gripping roller coaster script too dev anand as raju is released prison forgery goes small village inadvertently becomes villagers swami while his story comes out flashback he was slick talking guide rich man who just like fool didnt love his younger beautiful wife rosie played by waheeda rehman who turn loved dancing raju helped set up her career as stage performer fell love with her well far more it than just that characterisations are fairly deep but episodic as style was definitely preferred over substance by director vijay anand style is relentless continually restless cameras snappy movement screen streams audio interpolation or character interplay or invective means attention must be paid right start songs are beautiful more important than usual because theyre integral plot even waheeda ecstatically dancing by herself carried wealth information plot development out such great selection my favourites were piya tose naina laage re saiyaan beimaan both sung by lata with their colourful sets costumes vibrant dance routines fact theyre two my favourite lata songs ever stately gaata rahe mere dil duet by kishore kumar lata always sticks my mind afterwards aaj phir jeene was voted 12th bollywood movie song all time by listeners uk bbc asian network 2013 song lyrics are beautiful but dialogue is also wise life death may be illusions as averred by rajus soul but this surely is fact dev said people thought him mad pursuing with this hindi version when english one had flopped there was cool initial reaction film when it was released those wishing first time view olde bollywood start here this proper version is nearly three hours long yet still leaves you thinking that there could have been more was it rushed just like real life not perfect what is but once seen never forgotten,0.5644673721340386,0.25724867724867717,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Masterpiece of Indian Cinema.,"Guide review :Many of my friends ask me about my most favourite Bollywood film ever. It is a question most movie critics would evade as it is difficult to name one gem from amongst the many offered by Bollywood since its inception. But I always give Guide as the answer as there is no other Bollywood film which has impressed or inspired me so much.Like Mera Naam Joker (1970) is to Raj Kapoor, Guide is what defines Dev Anand. Playing the ever charming Raju guide who falls in love with the much married dancer Rosie (Waheeda Rehman), Dev Saahab has never looked or performed better...Vijay (Goldie) Anand's direction is first rate as he effortlessly transitions the narrative from an intense romance to a philosophical allegory. The simple carefree Raju guide's liasion with Rosie plunges him in to an abyss of vices and debauchery until he lands up behind bars for forging his lady love's signature. Post his release, he wanders aimlessly but fate leads him to become a saviour of a drought striken village. ""Aadmi yahan jaana chahta hai par kismat uske kaan pakadkar wahan le jaati hai"".Raju finds his redemption by fasting for the rains. ""Swami, do you believe it will rain?"" asks a firangi reporter to which his reply is ""These people believe so and I believe in these people!"".The dialogues are fantastic, Waheeda Rehman excels in her dances and even supporting actors like Kishore Sahu and Gajanan Jagirdar shine. The music by SD Burman is extraordinary to say the least and every song is simply a delight to watch. It is interesting how Goldie merges two excellent numbers - 'Saiyaan Beimaan' and 'Kya se Kya Ho Gaya' - in to one sequence creating a mesmerizing effect.The climax differs from the R. K. Narayan's original namesake novel on which this film is based. The philosophical touch of ""Main..main.. aur sirf main"" was Goldie's idea which still gives me goosebumps. It is actually a happy ending to the character if you think over it.Released in early 1965, Guide was a slow starter at the box office probably due to its then bold theme of extramarital relationship. The film picked up later when Gujarat suffered a drought and the makers cleverly put up large posters everywhere showing Dev Saahab in his Swami avatar with the tag line ""Guide prays for rains in Gujarat"". That struck an instant chord with the audience who then queued up outside theatres and made it a hit.Guide was a rare Hindi film to have an abridged English version for the overseas market.

9.0,MY REVIEW: Ahead of its times!!,"Director Vijay Anand casts his star brother Dev Anand in a story which demands more than charming presence of Dev Anand. The movie has two very different plots, one about the love hate relationship of Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman, and second Dev Anand being mistaken as a saint who is on fast to bring rains in the drought affected village. Vijay Anand excels in blending the two plots seamlessly. The post interval portion of the movie where Dev Anand's character start realizing the truth of life and death are the scenes where the movie touches the quality of being classic. The movie is packed with wonderful music by S.D.Burman, great songs picturization and the most accomplished performances by its lead actors.This movie released in 1965 showcases the bollywood capability of producing international level of cinema.",my review ahead its times,director vijay anand casts his star brother dev anand story which demands more than charming presence dev anand movie has two very different plots one about love hate relationship dev anand waheeda rehman second dev anand being mistaken as saint who is fast bring rains drought affected village vijay anand excels blending two plots seamlessly post interval portion movie where dev anands character start realizing truth life death are scenes where movie touches quality being classic movie is packed with wonderful music by s d burman great songs picturization most accomplished performances by its lead actors this movie released 1965 showcases bollywood capability producing international level cinema,0.5283333333333333,0.2761904761904762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.21}"

,"""Na Sukh Hai Naa Dukh Hai, Naa din Hai Naa Duniya, Naa Insaan Naa Bhagwaan, Sirf Mai""","If I were to make a list of movies I would want to watch moments before I die, it would be The Seventh Seal, Waking Life, Wild Strawberries, Groundhog Day, Pyaasa and a few others. But one movie which I would pick above all great ones I have mentioned, is Guide by Vijay Anand. It is hard to put into words what this movie means to me.For starters, it reminds me of my grandmother and the expression on her, every time she saw the film. Sometimes when you watch a movie again and again, eventually the emotional connect gets somewhat diluted but not this one. Based on the book by R.K. Narayan, Guide treaded into areas considered taboo for Indian society let alone films whether it is the ""extra marital affairs"" or ""living in relationship"". But the greatness of the movies lies in the fact that the brilliant script and the honesty of the performances never distracted the audience from the ""crux"" of the film. Easily Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman's best performances who handle a delicate subject with maturity and create the ""arc"" of the character through the film that actors so crave for. It was a once in lifetime role and they made it their own.The plot revolves around Raju makes a living by acting as a guide for tourists on one hand, and a con-man on another. He meets with Rosie Marco during one of his tours, and is attracted to her. He finds out that Rosie is unhappily married, would like to separate from her spouse, and take up acting and dancing. With Raju's encouragement, Rosie succeeds and both become rich beyond their imagination. Raju's lifestyle becomes easy, and he succumbs to gambling, and drinking in a big way. He forges a signature, is caught, arrested, tried in court, found guilty and imprisoned. Rosie will now have nothing to do with him. After Raju completes his prison sentence, he is released and travels far and wide in an attempt to meet Rosie and also to try and avoid returning to the city. He is mistaken for a Saint, and asked to preside over a temple in a region that is stricken by severe drought. Raju must offer prayers for rain and appease the people, or else they will expose him for fooling them. The question remains will he succeed in conning devotees that have come far and wide to watch him perform a miracle?What makes the film stand the test of time, is the truthful writing of the characters. Instead of reducing them to caricatures and making the film simplistic, they are shows as human being. Flawed, ambitious, capable of love or hatred, jealousy, greed and ultimately redemption. And how can I complete review on Guide without mentioning the music by S.D.Burman, truly one of the all time greats. But the champion of the film is arguably Vijay Anand. Till date I reckon he is technically one of the finest Indian directors. Unfortunately, we did not see a lot of him behind the camera and too much in front of the camera for my liking.A masterpiece of the highest order which not only abides by the ""bollywood"" format, but asks some pertinent questions about presence of God, nature of the man, existentialism.",na sukh hai naa dukh hai naa din hai naa duniya naa insaan naa bhagwaan sirf mai,if i were make list movies i would want watch moments before i die it would be seventh seal waking life wild strawberries groundhog day pyaasa few others but one movie which i would pick above all great ones i have mentioned is guide by vijay anand it is hard put into words what this movie means me starters it reminds me my grandmother expression her every time she saw film sometimes when you watch movie again again eventually emotional connect gets somewhat diluted but not this one based book by r k narayan guide treaded into areas considered taboo indian society let alone films whether it is extra marital affairs or living relationship but greatness movies lies fact that brilliant script honesty performances never distracted audience crux film easily dev anand waheeda rehmans best performances who handle delicate subject with maturity create arc character through film that actors so crave it was once lifetime role they made it their own plot revolves around raju makes living by acting as guide tourists one hand con man another he meets with rosie marco during one his tours is attracted her he finds out that rosie is unhappily married would like separate her spouse take up acting dancing with rajus encouragement rosie succeeds both become rich beyond their imagination rajus lifestyle becomes easy he succumbs gambling drinking big way he forges signature is caught arrested tried court found guilty imprisoned rosie will now have nothing do with him after raju completes his prison sentence he is released travels far wide attempt meet rosie also try avoid returning city he is mistaken saint asked preside over temple region that is stricken by severe drought raju must offer prayers rain appease people or else they will expose him fooling them question remains will he succeed conning devotees that have come far wide watch him perform miracle what makes film stand test time is truthful writing characters instead reducing them caricatures making film simplistic they are shows as human being flawed ambitious capable love or hatred jealousy greed ultimately redemption how can i complete review guide without mentioning music by s d burman truly one all time greats but champion film is arguably vijay anand till date i reckon he is technically one finest indian directors unfortunately we did not see lot him behind camera too much front camera my liking masterpiece highest order which not only abides by bollywood format but asks some pertinent questions about presence god nature man existentialism,0.527991452991453,0.10213675213675215,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,"Philosophical, meaningful and perfect entertainer","Raju Guide (Dev Anand) is a guide in Udaipur and he earns a modest living, living in a small house with his mother. And a day comes when an ambitious archaeologist, Marco (Kishore Sahu) arrives in the town with his wife, the lovely Rosie (Waheeda Rehman). She is the daughter of a ""devdasi"" and the mother wanting to save her daughter from the terrible fate of becoming a ""devdasi"" marries her off to a rich and honorable but neglecting Marco. Rosie is interested in dancing and Marco has no respect for her art. When the unhappy couple reaches Udaipur (Marco is here to excavate in some caves and has brought Rosie along), Raju senses the disturbances between the couple. For he saves Rosie not once, twice but thrice from suicide. He realizes that Marco has ignored her, treated her badly and she needed solace in a friend. Raju is just the man. While Marco is at work, Raju accompanies Rosie to a shop and she buys a pair of ""Ghughroo"". Raju sees her dance and appreciates it and Rosie is overjoyed. Then one day she goes to visit her husband unexpectedly and she realizes that Marco was having a merry time with another woman. She is distressed and Raju persuades her to leave her husband and chase her dreams. She does so but the society does not allow her to live happily. A married woman with another man was not acceptable in the 1960's but the audiences did appreciate this film as it was a blockbuster and remains a classic.Back to the story, Raju and Rosie defy the world even Raju's uncle who comes to take his sister (Raju's mother) away from him. Raju is tormented but by now he is in love with Rosie. He transforms her into a celebrity and their love life flourishes. But as humans have their weaknesses, Raju takes to drinking, smoking and gambling (his relationship with Rosie also deteriorates) and in a moment of weakness, (when Marco tries to get back Rosie and Raju wanting to keep Rosie away from Marco) he forges Rosie's signature on some documents and lands himself in a cell in prison. Rosie does not understand the reason why he committed this mistake. She thinks it was for her money and allows him to serve his sentence of two years refusing to grant bail. She however promises to wait for him. But Raju was freed after only one and half year in prison because of his good behavior. He decides to just leave his past and goes in search of unknown. Through a series of hilarious circumstances he becomes famous as one of the holy men of India. Then drought strikes in a nearby village and he is forced to fast for twelve days to appease the rain God. The story takes a dramatic turn. The attention loving and materialistic Raju turns to spiritualism so well shown in the film that it is the best part of it (Not even R K Narayan's novel on which the film is based had this part). Rosie and Raju's mother learn about his fast and the three are united here. But Raju is weak from his fast. Reporters from all over the world come to interview him and at last after some twelve days it rains and rains. Raju's fast comes in fruitful but at the cost of his life. Raju dies in the end and Rosie is left lamenting over him.It is a beautiful story well directed by Vijay Anand and powerful lead performances by Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman adds to the magic. Music by S.D. Burman is simply mesmerizing and the songs are all well sung and meaningful in each context. There are everlasting melodious numbers in Gaata Rehein Mera Dil(Kishore,Lata) Kato Se Kheechke Ye Aanchal (Lata) Din Dhal Jaye (Rafi) Piya Tose Naina Lage Re (Lata) Kya Se Kya (Rafi) Mose Chal Ke Ye Jaay (Lata) TereMere Sapnein (Rafi) Wahan Kaun Hai Tera (S.D.

10.0,Mirrors don't have memory,"Guide: because mirrors don't have memoryThe movie directed by a young 30 year old Vijay Anand is based on the book with the same name by R K Narayan. Apparently a one of the first Indo-Western collaboration with Dev Anand in the lead the movie was shot in Hindi and English. Chetan Anand who was supposed to simultaneously direct the Hindi version, due to creative differences with the English director, had to step aside as it was decided that Hindi version will be shot separately and as per Chetan's viewpoint after English version was completed. As luck would have it Chetan Anand got busy in making another classic called Haqeeqat and fortunately we had Vijay Anand to helm this masterpiece of cinema.The story is about a professional 'Guide' who believes that he is the best at whatever he does and thereby entitled to whatever he believes is rightfully his. This leads him from one success to another and to more success before it all falls apart in a moment of compulsive action that the protagonist is ingrained to take to ensure his success always remains the handicraft of his own making. From this point the movie takes us onto the path the protagonist takes not 'guided' by his own volition for the first time. Rest of the story is a wonderful exploration and expansion of human experience and has some spell binding moments that should be celebrated as mark of cinematic excellence.The movie works on the watcher at multiple levels. It has some of the most memorable songs, a romantic story which is the the heart of this guided journey, beautiful actors and depth of vedanta rarely touched in cinema before or since. Take for example the song: Din dhal jaaye raat na jaaye, tu to na aaye teri yaad staaye - Such beautifully painful words to express the pining for one's lover expressed in simple solar colloquialism. Or Wahan kaun hai tera musafir jaayega kahan Or Mose chall kiye jaaye so on and so forth. Its rare to find an album with each song jousting with the rest to outdo each other. The beauty of the songs doesnt just end with beautiful poetry, rendition and music but it extends to how they communicate such complex human experiences in such simple words.Take for example an antaara from Din dhal jaaye - Tum mujhse main dil se pareshan dono hain mazboor, aise me kisko koun manaaye - The Guide finally admits that he understands why the beloved is mad at him while also inadvertently letting out the truth that its his complusive nature that is the root cause something which becomes more accessible to him as he foregoes his previous life for an unknown path. Another example close to my heart is a stanza from waha koun hai tera - Kehte hain gyaani duniya hai faani, paani pe likhi likhaai, hai sab ki dekhi hai sabki jaani, haath kisi ke na aayi - what a clever use of water as the writing pad to communicate the concept of observing the play of maya and the futility of trying to hold onto it as reality.Each and every song contains the secret to the story yet to unfold or a beautiful exposition of feelings and emotions and thats just the appetizer. The way movie is shot is even more communicative. There is a scene where the guide is gifted a pair of wooden sandals by a village local aptly called bhola (simpleton) because the guide had helped him overcome a dire family emergency and bhola treats him as Swami (enlightened being). Now our protagonist thinks of bhola as a stupid and naive villager and laughingly accepts the sandals and is about the wear them. As he slips his feet into the sandals there is a 1 second shot where the feet slip on the sole of the wooden sandals before the guide steadies himself. Someone who has been so sure in his entire life, has commanded and commandeered his life per his wishes is for the first time taking a path where he doesnt know what and how the future will pan out and the slip communicates impactfully the signs of vulnerability which an uncertain future is going to face him....soon. In another scene when Guide is caught betwixt and between; if he accedes to villagers request to fast for rains, a proposition he considers stupid to the say least, he dies with no assurance of rains - if he doesn't he is letting down a group of people he has grown really fond of and in effect has been inadvertently living for them past few months. He doesn't want to let them down just as he has everyone in his past life. His mind made up to take up the request to fast unto death, the second layer of confusion traps him - i am not what these guys think I am - I am not as pious as they believe me to be and hence this undertaking is beyond my spiritual powers. He confesses to Bhola alone about his entre life story and stands in front of him expecting him to out him and give him a punishment for leading the villagers astray for his own selfish survival needs. Bhola simply says - Swami the creators ways are only known to him. Who are you and I to question them? Valmiki from being a bandit became a Saint.The facade of smart vs stupid simply crumbles for our guide in front of this acceptance by bhola despite what he believed should have made him hate him till eternity. His acquired sense of right and wrong, immorality of morality and above all judging others all smashed to smithreens in front of the bholaness of bhola. If his is not the defintion of unconditional love then what is? This is the pivotal moment in movie where our guide surrenders himself completely to the faith villagers have in him and let this faith Guide the rest of his life journey.Guide is an ensemble of life and just like life it has something for everyone depending upon watcher's procilivities.Dev Anand delivers a performance for ages securing his legacy. Waheeda gave us a glimpse of her dancing genius for the first time and Vijay Anand delivered a masterpiece and a fulfilling movie full of life; not as we know it but as it is. As Indian culture piques more interest around the world its my firm belief that Guide would be celebrated as a must watch life tale across the world.In today's Hindi cinema this movie should encourage our film makers especially one's who rule the roost that this is also one way to look at cinema. The superstars should seek comfort that if Dev Anand could put his money where his mouth is then so can they with more adventurous real life stories. If they are still scared about their capabilities they look no further than Vijay Anand for inspiration and if they feel too caught up with their own film making habits, I would recommend a mirror for inspiration because mirrors dont have memory.",mirrors dont have memory,guide because mirrors dont have memorythe movie directed by young 30 year old vijay anand is based book with same name by r k

10.0,"A story of love, betrayal and redemption","An outstanding film that has retained its gem-like brilliance over the years. It is based on a story from RK Narayan. Raju is a small town guide, good at heart, charismatic and a fast talker. He is hired by archaeologist Marco to take him on a quest for cave sculptures. Marco is accompanied by his beautiful wife Rosie whom he neglects completely. Raju senses Rosie's love for music and dance and Marco's rejection of Rosie's talent. He encourages her to leave her husband. Rosie moves into his house, she is seen as a fallen woman by Raju's mother and the neighbors but Raju helps her train and succeed at a stage career. Rosie is famous and Raju is living the high life on her money. This causes a rift that cannot be breached when Raju forges a check. He is jailed, comes out of jail and drifts until he is spotted by some villagers, taken to be a holy man. The mantle of a swami is thrust upon him and he is asked to go on a fast so that the village will get rain.. Will Raju transform from skeptic to believer? Will there be rain and redemption for him? Guide starts out as a romance and ends as a philosophical look at human nature, at the power of human belief and sacrifice.The film has outstanding performances - Waheeda excels as Rosie. She is the rejected wife, the shy lover, the proud diva.. Her dancing skills are showcased throughout the film in numerous numbers like ""Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai"", ""Mose Chal Kiye Jai"", but the snake dance she performs in a village is an outstanding example of her phenomenal talent. Dev delivers a performance of a lifetime as Raju - he was always the fast talker, but he also plays the naive lover, the rejected and spurned lover, the reluctant swami very well. His moments of self analysis in the village are brilliant. The supporting cast shines. The music by Sachin Dev Burman is divine. Many songs from this film have an everlasting appeal and topmost is Gata Rahe Mera Dil.This is brilliant cinema - one of the best from India and well worth many a watch.",story love betrayal redemption,outstanding film that has retained its gem like brilliance over years it is based story rk narayan raju is small town guide good at heart charismatic fast talker he is hired by archaeologist marco take him quest cave sculptures marco is accompanied by his beautiful wife rosie whom he neglects completely raju senses rosies love music dance marcos rejection rosies talent he encourages her leave her husband rosie moves into his house she is seen as fallen woman by rajus mother neighbors but raju helps her train succeed at stage career rosie is famous raju is living high life her money this causes rift that cannot be breached when raju forges check he is jailed comes out jail drifts until he is spotted by some villagers taken be holy man mantle swami is thrust upon him he is asked go fast so that village will get rain will raju transform skeptic believer will there be rain redemption him guide starts out as romance ends as philosophical look at human nature at power human belief sacrifice film has outstanding performances waheeda excels as rosie she is rejected wife shy lover proud diva her dancing skills are showcased throughout film numerous numbers like aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hai mose chal kiye jai but snake dance she performs village is outstanding example her phenomenal talent dev delivers performance lifetime as raju he was always fast talker but he also plays naive lover rejected spurned lover reluctant swami very well his moments self analysis village are brilliant supporting cast shines music by sachin dev burman is divine many songs this film have everlasting appeal topmost is gata rahe mera dil this is brilliant cinema one best india well worth many watch,0.56921875,0.33156250000000004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,The Spiritual Guide,"Guide the award winning story by R K Narayan is a masterpiece of all times. One of the few films I liked from my heart. This movie made Navketan Banners a household name.Raju (Dev Anand) is a railway guide. Rosie is the neglected wife of an Archaeologist (Rehman) has a passion for dancing. They meet in one of those trips of Rosie with her husband when Raju becomes their Guide to that town. Raju becomes her dance guide and finally a spiritual guide.When Rosie becomes successful Raju becomes insecure. He succumbs to drinking and gambling. Raju gets involved in forgery and goes to Jail. After getting out of the Jail, he is passing through a village where he is mistaken as a Sadhu by some local villagers. Raju takes advantage of the situation and starts living in that village. Then comes a famine in that village. Villagers are tensed. By this time Raju has become a Swamiji. During that time Raju is narrating a story to one of the villager as to how a man keeps fast to bring rain to a certain village. This villager likes the story so much that he goes and spreads that Swamiji will keep fast to bring rain. Though Raju wanted not to, but he goes on a fast seeing all villagers trust in him. And wonder of wonders; it rains.The movie was a technically genius during 1965. The music, art, cinematography sets it apart from all others and won most of the words. Followed by Tere Mere Sapne, Guide is Vijay Anand's best movie yet. The song 'Aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hei' portrays life at it best.The movie was a masterpiece and inspiration to many peoples. Guide is a movie made in India and for India. This is one movie which is still watchable.",spiritual guide,guide award winning story by r k narayan is masterpiece all times one few films i liked my heart this movie made navketan banners household name raju dev anand is railway guide rosie is neglected wife archaeologist rehman has passion dancing they meet one those trips rosie with her husband when raju becomes their guide that town raju becomes her dance guide finally spiritual guide when rosie becomes successful raju becomes insecure he succumbs drinking gambling raju gets involved forgery goes jail after getting out jail he is passing through village where he is mistaken as sadhu by some local villagers raju takes advantage situation starts living that village then comes famine that village villagers are tensed by this time raju has become swamiji during that time raju is narrating story one villager as how man keeps fast bring rain certain village this villager likes story so much that he goes spreads that swamiji will keep fast bring rain though raju wanted not but he goes fast seeing all villagers trust him wonder wonders it rains movie was technically genius during 1965 music art cinematography sets it apart all others won most words followed by tere mere sapne guide is vijay anands best movie yet song aaj phir jeene ki tamanna hei portrays life at it best movie was masterpiece inspiration many peoples guide is movie made india india this is one movie which is still watchable,0.4053854875283446,0.2125850340136054,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.42, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.35}"
2.0,Overrated here and actually quite awful!,"SPOILERS POSSIBLEI rented this movie as I had heard it was an Indian classic. I was very impressed by the far superior MOTHER India and since GUIDE was one of the first Bollywood musicals to get an American release, I figured it was something special. The comments here on IMDb enforced the risk of the three hour investment, but they turned out to be strictly sentimental.What a disappointment! Previous reviewers acclaimed this as a pioneer musical and a consummate Indian film, but besides possibly establishing the absurd plot format of all future Bollywood films, (good prostitutes, distressed drunks, suffering mothers, silly uncles) the premise is strictly lifted from 1930's B level Hollywood musicals. This is a tale about a cheerful tour GUIDE with a Tin-Tin hairdo who falls on hard times when he encounters an unhappy bride. The Bride, a crude-mouthed prostitute's daughter, is in an unhappy marriage with a wealthy archaeologist who is older and has no time for her. She indeed wants to be a snake dancer in spite of having an enormous arse that would make dancing an improbable career choice. After many suicide attempts and melodramatic over-acted moments, she runs away with the GUIDE who alienates family, friends and neighbours in order to keep the bumble-bee-arsed dancer within his grips. Once there she melodramatically attempts to run away and spare him the anguish but seems unable to find the door and decides to practise her vulgar dancing there instead. After chasing away his beloved mother, he guides her career to incomprehensible international success (see every bad Hollywood musical from the early sound era) where, even in Europe, audiences reward her with enthusiastic applause apparently for running with bells on her ankles and spinning in place. She becomes his meal ticket and so he marries her and they revel in their new found ""shared"" wealth. Her estranged former husband, impressed with her success, sends her a copy of his new book and rewards her by sharing the family jewels. The GUIDE forges her signature on the agreement so as to avoid her contact with the man who once caused her so much pain. She rewards him by pressing charges against him and sending him to jail.The movie then goes on an extra journey of self discovery and plot filler (see THE RAZOR'S EDGE -1946 for more information of where that was blatantly stolen from)not worth going into, for a contrived ending that would allow for the required three hour running time to finally come to an end. The now seemingly typical Bollywood musical numbers feature people running across fields singing and dancing cannot help this movie from being mundane and badly dated even by 1950's Indian standards. Most modern Bollywood films steal from the best of Hollywood. GUIDE steals from the worse of the early Western sound films. (Satyajit Ray, why didn't you stop them!) Stick to MOTHER India and the modern Shah Rukh Khan films with beautiful and talented female leads and avoid this mess at all costs.",overrated here actually quite awful,spoilers possiblei rented this movie as i had heard it was indian classic i was very impressed by far superior mother india since guide was one first bollywood musicals get american release i figured it was something special comments here imdb enforced risk three hour investment but they turned out be strictly sentimental what disappointment previous reviewers acclaimed this as pioneer musical consummate indian film but besides possibly establishing absurd plot format all future bollywood films good prostitutes distressed drunks suffering mothers silly uncles premise is strictly lifted 1930s b level hollywood musicals this is tale about cheerful tour guide with tin tin hairdo who falls hard times when he encounters unhappy bride bride crude mouthed prostitutes daughter is unhappy marriage with wealthy archaeologist who is older has no time her she indeed wants be snake dancer spite having enormous arse that would make dancing improbable career choice after many suicide attempts melodramatic over acted moments she runs away with guide who alienates family friends neighbours order keep bumble bee arsed dancer within his grips once there she melodramatically attempts run away spare him anguish but seems unable find door decides practise her vulgar dancing there instead after chasing away his beloved mother he guides her career incomprehensible international success see every bad hollywood musical early sound era where even europe audiences reward her with enthusiastic applause apparently running with bells her ankles spinning place she becomes his meal ticket so he marries her they revel their new found shared wealth her estranged former husband impressed with her success sends her copy his new book rewards her by sharing family jewels guide forges her signature agreement so as avoid her contact with man who once caused her so much pain she rewards him by pressing charges against him sending him jail movie then goes extra journey self discovery plot filler see razors edge 1946 more information where that was blatantly stolen not worth going into contrived ending that would allow required three hour running time finally come end now seemingly typical bollywood musical numbers feature people running across fields singing dancing cannot help this movie being mundane badly dated even by 1950s indian standards most modern bollywood films steal best hollywood guide steals worse early western sound films satyajit ray why didnt you stop them stick mother india modern shah rukh khan films with beautiful talented female leads avoid this mess at all costs,0.502374678461635,0.06371792458748982,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
