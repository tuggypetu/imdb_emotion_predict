10.0,"A slow burner, a fine achievement","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none.

10.0,This movie has a brilliant script...,"It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER.",this movie has brilliant script,it appears jury is hung many people either loved or hated this movie i can tell you why i loved it first all script i think it had real slice life brilliance it sorry but some people do use 4 letter words express themselves no it doesnt mean thats because they lack intelligence use anything else i can rise occasion any time i need w out profanity but it is how i think speak my day day life language shouldnt even be issue if thats all you heard you werent listening brilliance it is everywhere example williams character putting damons character place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with i know people like that then moments when he williams character says gems like ill save you suspense sport she isnt perfect neither are you question is whether you are perfect each other im paraphrasing course question relationships life career decisions courage risk overcoming whatever your background is are all part real life this isnt supposed be about genius or some white trash as someone else said some people might say kids this movie arent trash just normal hard working middle class guys its about love life courage courage ante up try again no matter how many times life knocks us around acting direction script are wonderful they definitely deserved oscar this it has soul it has meaning i am sad people that didnt get it as movie american beauty said look closer,0.5725961538461538,0.16810897435897437,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,The Genius In Our Midst,"So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us. I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent.",genius our midst,so many personal projects our best players never come out quite right vision they have somehow doesnt translate screen or its not box office subject matter or maybe actors arent gifted with writing or directing talent thats certainly not case with good will hunting which was not only breakthrough film matt damon ben affleck but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film their native boston city they grew up city they seem know every nook cranny they didnt even have lose new england accents they would have most their other films when matt ben wrote good will hunting fact they were able interest top director like gus van sant project should have said something before one views frame film van sant got oscar nominated performance matt damon supporting actor oscar robin williams as psychologist who counsels damon will hunting is this average lower middle class kid south boston who was foster care system suffered lot abuse while growing up he has some low level jobs hes constantly getting trouble with law minor scrapes hes functioning genius who kicks solves highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at mit which perks interest stellan skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there he feels i agree with him that one worst sins world is wasting talent deity blesses you with whatever it is after succession therapists who are unable cope with damons genius robin williams gets his turn at bat robin williams one wildest wackiest most innovative comics that ever walked earth drops all that deliver highly sensitive performance as psychologist who finally reaches damon some level what damon does with it is you see good will hunting some that breakthrough is achieved with help minnie driver british student at harvard who falls hard blue collar will hunting most it is achieved though films key scene as ben affleck tells him that no matter what your iq is if you dont use it move up youre stupidest guy here its one afflecks best scenes his whole career film ive known few will huntings my day blessed with talent i would like have had who threw it away combination reasons one particular i knew back eighties was kid who originally grew up virginia blue ridge mountain country some really uneducated hicks they discovered he was gay immediately had him committed back day they did all kinds things him like electroshock therapy guess what it all didnt work but it left him twisted bitter person who gravitated new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as human being he also was blessed with incredible baritone singing voice he could have sang opera had that been trained instead his parents trying change his orientation but when i last saw him middle eighties no one had or could reach him he made living running cleaning service apartments if he couldnt sing militant songs protest he wasnt interested even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied learned developed unlike will hunting jimmy flowers wasnt reached as far as i know but matt damon ben affleck writing their oscar winning original screenplay could have known him so im sure they wont mind if i dedicated this review jimmy whether hes alive or no longer with us im sure there are jimmy flowers will huntings that weve all known hopefully we have wit recognize talent whatever it is encouraging nature make people develop that talent,0.47549292092770357,0.17069515026036766,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Incredible,"I don't think I have been this moved by a movie in a while. Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.Good Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.The acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best ""drama"" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.All in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",incredible,i dont think i have been this moved by movie while good will hunting is incredible movie if i had say what i think is gus van sants best film this would be it it is slow burner but i think this was purposefully done it added films poignancy psychological aspect good will hunting is beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery it is directed wonderfully by van sant music is never obtrusive but never too low key either while story is interesting compelling script intelligently written acting is one films best assets as well as its compellingly real characters robin williams is superb one his best drama roles while ben affleck has never been better matt damon gives another fine performance match his performance talented mr ripley minnie driver is also quite touching believable all all incredible movie 10 10 bethany cox,0.6076923076923078,0.5602564102564102,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.13}"
9.0,"""I had to go see about a girl""","This is one of those films that you cant help walking away from without being touched in some way. All of the central themes to adult life are explored and exposed by a very good cast. Friendship, love, pain, the past holding back who we could be in the present, acceptance (or not) of our place in society.""Good Will Hunting"" is the story of Will Hunting played by Matt Damon. He is a young man who is a mathematical genius but has no formal education and who is so traumatised by his past that he will not allow himself to be the man he could with his talents. Will works as a Janitor, but chose the Massachusetts institute of technology (the finest mathematical institution in America as we are told) as the place to work in order to be close to an outlet for his brilliance. Early on in the story, the resident Maths guru Professor Gerry Lambeau sets a problem for his students to solve which should take the whole semester for the average mind. When this problem is solved and written on the faculty blackboard the very next morning, he sets another that took him personally two years to solve. The following day he is conversing with a colleague when he witnesses Will writing down the perfect solution on the blackboard again. The Professor realises he has a genius hiding in his midst.When Will is later involved in a fight, he is eventually given the choice between a short prison term or working with the Professor on a daily basis and also attending psychiatric therapy sessions. Will chooses the latter but uses the therapy sessions as a chance to mock the Psychiatrists assigned to him and show off his knowledge. When no one else will work with him, Professor Lambeau turns to his old room mate at college, Sean MacGuire (played by Robin Williams on Oscar winning form.) who manages to reach the boy emotionally and start to repair the damage that has been done to him.It is widely known that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck co wrote the screen play as a reaction to their slow progress in establishing Hollywood careers. It is a testament to their talent as writers that they came up with so many touching scenes and passages of dialogue. In particular, Williams monologue to Damon when sat on the park bench is sublime. Wills relationship with ""Skylar"" (played by Minnie Driver) is perfectly believable and as the story unfolds the viewer can see the change in Wills character from the cocky kid, pushing everyone away, to the young man who understands who he could be with the right encouragement.There are very few flaws to be found in this film, largely because the story is so well told and Robin Williams performance is worth the entry price alone. It is a genuinely touching experience which relates to so many people and is easy to empathise with in real life. The characters are richly written and they are all interdependent in the telling of the proceedings. You really care what happens to these people.I could ""nick pick"" and draw attention to the psychiatrist scenes in Robert Redfords ""Ordinary People"" (1980) which bear close resemblance to the ones in ""Good Will Hunting"" but I think Damon and Affleck just took the bar up another notch with their interpretation of the Doctor / Patient working relationship.All in all an uplifting and worthwhile movie going experience which will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.",i had go see about girl,this is one those films that you cant help walking away without being touched some way all central themes adult life are explored exposed by very good cast friendship love pain past holding back who we could be present acceptance or not our place society good will hunting is story will hunting played by matt damon he is young man who is mathematical genius but has no formal education who is so traumatised by his past that he will not allow himself be man he could with his talents will works as janitor but chose massachusetts institute technology finest mathematical institution america as we are told as place work order be close outlet his brilliance early story resident maths guru professor gerry lambeau sets problem his students solve which should take whole semester average mind when this problem is solved written faculty blackboard very next morning he sets another that took him personally two years solve following day he is conversing with colleague when he witnesses will writing down perfect solution blackboard again professor realises he has genius hiding his midst when will is later involved fight he is eventually given choice between short prison term or working with professor daily basis also attending psychiatric therapy sessions will chooses latter but uses therapy sessions as chance mock psychiatrists assigned him show off his knowledge when no one else will work with him professor lambeau turns his old room mate at college sean macguire played by robin williams oscar winning form who manages reach boy emotionally start repair damage that has been done him it is widely known that matt damon ben affleck co wrote screen play as reaction their slow progress establishing hollywood careers it is testament their talent as writers that they came up with so many touching scenes passages dialogue particular williams monologue damon when sat park bench is sublime wills relationship with skylar played by minnie driver is perfectly believable as story unfolds viewer can see change wills character cocky kid pushing everyone away young man who understands who he could be with right encouragement there are very few flaws be found this film largely because story is so well told robin williams performance is worth entry price alone it is genuinely touching experience which relates so many people is easy empathise with real life characters are richly written they are all interdependent telling proceedings you really care what happens these people i could nick pick draw attention psychiatrist scenes robert redfords ordinary people 1980 which bear close resemblance ones good will hunting but i think damon affleck just took bar up another notch with their interpretation doctor patient working relationship all all uplifting worthwhile movie going experience which will stay with you long after you leave cinema,0.37407839326206677,0.1677437641723356,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.47}"
,The Real Best Picture of 1997,"While everyone took sides with L.A. Confidential (for it's Old Hollywood flair and tight-as-a-girdle plot arc) or Titanic (for it's generally inescapable, juggernaut-like aura) as the Best Picture of 1997, it seems that too many people overlook Good Will Hunting for what it was: a timeless little opus that managed to make South Boston look romantic and happened to make Ben Affleck and Matt Damon some of the most deserving superstars in recent memory.Because before they were anybody, they were just the writers of this tale of a reluctant human being named Will Hunting, a mathematical genius who wore the guise of a hoodlum, and all of the sudden obstacles he had to take on to truly step in to manhood. Among these obstacles were a straight-forward shrink who outright dared Will to bulls*** him (played by Robin Williams, who got his overdue Oscar for it), a brilliant M.I.T. professor who felt it his own personal redemption to put Will's mind to great use somehow (Stellan Skarsgård, who never fails to steal nearly every scene he's in), and a girl who doesn't understand why the boy she loves so much cannot love her.It was these obstacles that made Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships). His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching.",real best picture 1997,while everyone took sides with l confidential its old hollywood flair tight as girdle plot arc or titanic its generally inescapable juggernaut like aura as best picture 1997 it seems that too many people overlook good will hunting what it was timeless little opus that managed make south boston look romantic happened make ben affleck matt damon some most deserving superstars recent memory because before they were anybody they were just writers this tale reluctant human being named will hunting mathematical genius who wore guise hoodlum all sudden obstacles he had take truly step manhood among these obstacles were straight forward shrink who outright dared will bulls him played by robin williams who got his overdue oscar it brilliant m i t professor who felt it his own personal redemption put wills mind great use somehow stellan skarsg rd who never fails steal nearly every scene hes girl who doesnt understand why boy she loves so much cannot love her it was these obstacles that made will hunting such complex character while he was genius at definite math he was bit moron at indefinite human relationships his rough edged exterior was simply cry help process which obstacles his life realized that attempted help him was nothing short extraordinarily touching,0.40521235521235527,0.18199806949806954,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,Two Pals Make Good in Hollywood,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script. The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way. Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.What ""Hunting"" essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity. What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure. This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing. The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating. Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck ""paid their dues"" -- and success did not just fall into their laps. These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality.

,Good doesn't describe it!,"I am totally dumbfounded by some of the reactions to this film. I'm imagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame of mind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket. Then there are the people calling it unrealistic. Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently. Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing! Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK. Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel. The script is one of the best I've ever seen. The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like The Catcher in the Rye'. Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, get in touch with your inner Robin Williams'. But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board. Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells. Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines `Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?' `Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it. Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will! I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms. But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast.  It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream.

10.0,"Incredible, moving movie.","A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie, and I only hope to add a few more praises.The fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me, I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script, but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.Matt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben.

He can't relate to others, especially women. After many failures to help him, he hooks up with a man who respects him (but who also fears his insights) played by Robin Williams in one of his finer dramatic roles. He pushes Will and Will pushes back. The interaction between two imperfect, but brilliant, human beings is the core of this movie.

8.0,Thoughtful Warm Film,"For the longest period of time I never understood the title of this film. Was it about someone on some Diogenes style quest? Or was was it about someone who scowers thrift stores? Well, it has nothing to do with good will or Goodwill, it's about a young man called Will Hunting. He's a(somewhat unrealistic)genius who can solve math problems that baffle the world's greatest minds and knows twice as much on any subject covered in a Harvard class...yet he works as a janitor. A professor at MIT stumbles across and sets him up with a therapist, who tries to counsel Will while drilling to the core of his problems.The film might be centered around Matt Damon, who gives a deep performance, but Robin Williams claims every scene he's in and is the most memorable thing from this film. As you probably know, the picture also features Ben Affleck in a limited role, through which he still makes his talent evident. But while Damon, Affleck and William's may have been good choices Minnie Driver certainly wasn't. Who thought of her for the role or what they saw I'll never know.The backstory behind the script is so well known that I won't bother going over it; all I will add is that Affleck and Damon didn't do to bad a job for a first time and recieved a merited Oscar for it.Good Will Hunting is a thought provoking film and that's why so many enjoy it.

MIT Prof. Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård) always puts a challenging problem outside his class for his students. Will is on parole, given a janitorial job and solves the problem. Lambeau is surprised that nobody claims the solution and puts another problem up. He catches the janitor doing the solution and helps him in his trial for hitting a cop. Will is a mess. He's an orphan who suffered as a foster child. He meets Skylar (Minnie Driver) but can't quite open up to her until he starts seeing Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Maguire is Lambeau's last resort. They were college roommates and he is suffering from the lost of his wife.These are great characters. The first meeting between Will and Dr. Maguire is electric.

4.0,It`s Not Good,"What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyFirst off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied hereThere are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in lifeBut I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing",it s not good,what is about mathematical geniuses that get critics juices flowing beautiful mind wasn t up much my opinion fellowship ring deserved oscar that year while good will hunting had several awards lavished it undeservedlyfirst off is script when i attended film school i was told good will hunting is very good example how not start script tutor was right this movie lacks any type opening hook most part it s very very slow if you wrote unsolicited script like this script reader would have given up it by page 15structure aside idea member american underclass being some sort intellectual god doesn t really ring true ask yourself this if he s cleverst character movie how come he s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities not one single teacher his childhood noticed his gift highly unlikely as is fact he s read so much mind expanding litrature if will s so clever how come he s so oblivous what happens young good looking boys american prisons but it s casting that let much film down you want get couple actors play rough tough irish gang members let s get matt damon ben affleck which is like getting russell crowe play pacifist or charles bronson play liberal do gooder i failed be convinced by foul mouthed damon affleck as they strutted about smacking people chops couldn t help thinking that even though they wrote script parts should have been awarded different actors after all billy bob thornton has written screenplays films he hasn t been cast same criteria should have been applied herethere are some good points movie robin williams is excellent as man who tries show will his potential also very good is stellan skarsgard who is quite simply one greatest character actors stepped foot outside europe despite my previous criticism script there is quite moving piece dialogue at park as williams character explains will what he has seen lifebut i ve got repeat that there s less plus points than negatives this movie i ve got agree with people who ve said good will hunting is boring unconvincing,0.45118678479143615,0.1577482465854559,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,Snark Hunting,"I admire films that shoot high and miss. But it really rankles me when a film pretends to shoot high, avoids doing so because of lack of talent, and lies to us in the process.There's great drama in the mere existence of an idiot savant. These are people who often are intolerable socially, inadequate in common thinking skills, and generally lead a cursed `elephantman' life, except for their celebration as (in this case) mathematicians. Instead, we're given a watered down likeable homeboy who has been abused. Oh and he has a photographic memory which is a separate pathology (the two never coincide). Depth discarded.There's truly deep drama in the mathematical problems good Will would be dealing with. But this would require a Nabokov, and his mastery of metaphor. Instead we get the koolaid version for dummies in some (as it turns out) meaningless scribbles and a bubble diagram. Depth is twice discarded. Believe me, this could be played up big; the power of a christ in some of the insights that are speculated -- the voice and eye of God.There's also common, but good drama in the dedicating of one's life to their gift at great personal sacrifice. We actually have some good films in this regard concerning musicians. Math is better since you don't even get the applause. Here the guy with the insights but lack of language would be codependent martyr with the expert in the formalisms but no vision. But too hard, so pass.I can attest that there are cinematic depths to be mined at NSA, MIT, even Southie in terms of the absolutely unique and strange feel of the places. How could this film have missed those dark assets and end up so totally without atmosphere?This movie got made for one reason only: Robin Williams saw a part for himself. Therefore, the previously described ignorances are filled by an amplified backstory so Williams can find himself after losing his wife. Pretty damned offensive given the possibilities. I predict that someone will do this story (or something like it) well sometime before I die. It's just too rich, and we do have some bright minds available.

You have to wonder where those nuggets of wisdom came from for the characters to deal with each other in such a credible fashion.I think a lot of viewers, particularly male, can relate to Will's seeming lack of direction; personally, my own period of existential angst occurred right about the same time Will was dealing with his. My only trouble was that I wasn't as brilliant as the character portrayed by Damon, his was a one in a million intellect that could see solutions to mathematical problems that someone like myself would fail to comprehend. Perhaps the overarching problem one faces is unless you have a passion about a certain thing, then how do you know what kind of career to pursue or who the right person is to establish a lifetime commitment with. I'm sure a lot of people never figure it out.I've seen this movie a couple of times in the past, but my viewing the other day was kind of significant in an odd way concerning guys like Ben Affleck and brother Casey. It has to be embarrassing for Affleck to see himself now in a film where he's such an insensitive jerk when it comes to women.
