9,Pure entertainment,"Chitram is possibly the biggest commercial success in Malayalam cinema having run of nearly two years at the box office. But more than its commercial success the movie remembered for two striking reasons - [1] The emergence of Mohanlal as a star and actor par excellence, and [2] The epoch of the golden era of Malayalam movies typified with excellent music and strong story lines.To summarize, the movie is about Mohanlal a youth who is struggling in life and is dogged by fate. He agrees to be a makeshift husband to Renjini at the behest of Nedumudi Venu to keep Renjini's father happy during his last visit to India. The chemistry between Lal and Renjini is quite good and their squabbles make up a major part of the movie. The movie has twist in the end, which is best seen than described.Lal is the fulcrum around which this movies revolves. He displays emotions and comic timing both with remarkable ease and his scenes with Venu are brilliant and endearing at the same time. Venu is an apt foil for Lal while Sreenivasan has a great comedy track. Sreeni also deserves credit for coming up with a script that keeps the viewer hooked throughout. Renjini is competent.The highlight of the movie (besides Lal's path-breaking performance) is the fantastic music which is popular even after two decades. This was the first Malayalam movie in which original soundtrack was accompanied by the hero's voice-over. Chitram marks the beginning of an era of great Malayalam movie music.Overall, a must-see for all Malayalam movie fans.",pure entertainment,chitram is possibly biggest commercial success malayalam cinema having run nearly two years at box office but more than its commercial success movie remembered two striking reasons emergence mohanlal as star actor par excellence epoch golden era malayalam movies typified with excellent music strong story lines summarize movie is about mohanlal youth who is struggling life is dogged by fate he agrees be makeshift husband renjini at behest nedumudi venu keep renjinis father happy during his last visit india chemistry between lal renjini is quite good their squabbles make up major part movie movie has twist end which is best seen than described lal is fulcrum around which this movies revolves he displays emotions comic timing both with remarkable ease his scenes with venu are brilliant endearing at same time venu is apt foil lal while sreenivasan has great comedy track sreeni also deserves credit coming up with script that keeps viewer hooked throughout renjini is competent highlight movie besides lals path breaking performance is fantastic music which is popular even after two decades this was first malayalam movie which original soundtrack was accompanied by heros voice over chitram marks beginning era great malayalam movie music overall must see all malayalam movie fans,0.5491935483870969,0.4172619047619048,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10,365 day run in Little Shenoys .....,"Dear Malayali movie fans, I remember the first posters of Chithram did not make much of an impression on me. I was 8 years old when the film released. The posters were near the Twinkle showroom. Behind Shenoys theater. The posters predicted a regular love story. But once the film released, it was a rage. It was tough to get tickets. But I finally managed to watch it at the Little Shenoys theater if memory serves me right. Or was it Shenoys? I don't remember. Despite the comedic scenes, the film made me cry. Especially the second half and the ending. Priyadarshan was such a good craftsman. He made a blockbuster film with a second half that was mostly weepy. The film has made an impact across generations of Malayalis. It is the preferred tragi-comic film for most of you. Lalettans tragi-comic character is one of the most famous roles in his career. Ranjini and Nedumudi were adorable in supporting roles. I can never forget how this film influenced me as a little kid. But then, I have not watched this film in ages. It might not affect me the way it did almost 30 years ago. Which is sad I guess. Me and my wife sing some of the popular songs from this film when we get drunk. Best Regards, Pimpin.

8,A screwball Rom-Com of 30s Hollywood meets bitter facts of Life to form a Timeless Malayalam Classic.,"Chithram (1988) : Brief Review -A screwball Rom-Com of 30s Hollywood meets bitter facts of Life to form a Timeless Malayalam Classic. Chithram has been considered as one of the finest romantic drama of Mohanlal and Priyadarshan's careers by their fans but is it really a Romantic Drama? Or is it really even a Rom-com? The answer should have been No but seems like that Malayalam audience of 80s wasn't aware of 30s & 40s Hollywood Classics. Indian TVs wouldn't show those Hollywood films then so it was obvious and considering the regional limits of global cinema viewing makes this equation completely irrelevant. For me, Chithram is more easy film review in 2021 that too after seeing almost 1000+ old Hollywood classics because i understand those tactics and know those cliches which were formed almost 50 years before this film was released. I won't name any Old Holywood classic to avoid the comparison but i could feel that Screwball Formula all over while watching Chithram. A woman hires a stranger to pose as her husband because she doesn't want her ailing father to know that her fiance broke their engagement. Well, it doesn't end like those happily ended films to leave audience smiling. Instead, it brings some bitter facts and mistakes of life to leave audience with a stunning reality-check against the mainstream entertainers. The film is not funny actually, i don't know why people even call it a comedy. I'd better say it's an engaging rom-com with sweet and adorable cliches. Mohanlal, Ranjini and Nedumudi Venu are best performers in the film. Dialogues are decent, screenplay is very nicely shaped, music is good and direction is immensely dedicated. Priyadarshan dares to go for a climax which he would know that family audience may not accept but sometimes a gutsy attempt brings you more success than expected. Chithram is prime example of that. Overall, a Classic Drama with no expiry date.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",screwball rom com 30s hollywood meets bitter facts life form timeless malayalam classic,chithram 1988 brief review screwball rom com 30s hollywood meets bitter facts life form timeless malayalam classic chithram has been considered as one finest romantic drama mohanlal priyadarshans careers by their fans but is it really romantic drama or is it really even rom com answer should have been no but seems like that malayalam audience 80s wasnt aware 30s 40s hollywood classics indian tvs wouldnt show those hollywood films then so it was obvious considering regional limits global cinema viewing makes this equation completely irrelevant me chithram is more easy film review 2021 that too after seeing almost 1000 old hollywood classics because i understand those tactics know those cliches which were formed almost 50 years before this film was released i wont name any old holywood classic avoid comparison but i could feel that screwball formula all over while watching chithram woman hires stranger pose as her husband because she doesnt want her ailing father know that her fiance broke their engagement well it doesnt end like those happily ended films leave audience smiling instead it brings some bitter facts mistakes life leave audience with stunning reality check against mainstream entertainers film is not funny actually i dont know why people even call it comedy id better say its engaging rom com with sweet adorable cliches mohanlal ranjini nedumudi venu are best performers film dialogues are decent screenplay is very nicely shaped music is good direction is immensely dedicated priyadarshan dares go climax which he would know that family audience may not accept but sometimes gutsy attempt brings you more success than expected chithram is prime example that overall classic drama with no expiry date rating 8 10 by,0.4888888888888888,0.2144907407407408,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"

10,A good movie that stands out and is still in the mind,"The movie is an all-time hit in Malayalam. The movie directed by Priyadarshan came to theater in 1988. Soon comes Mohanlal's uncle Vishnu to arrest 3 prisoners. Mohanlal is the culprit who was sentenced to death. In the meanwhile, the Malayalees saw the new life of Vishnu asking to say, ""Sir, why not?"" The background score of the movie is still Malayali's favorite ring tone.
