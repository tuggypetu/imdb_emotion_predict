4.0,"Wait, was this supposed to be romantic???","I was curious about the film's title. As it turns out, the film is named after a record store chain called 'Licorice Pizza'. Also, according to director Paul Thomas Anderson, both licorice and pizza resonate with childhood memories, and he liked the sound of that for a coming of age movie.I have several issues with this highly acclaimed film. Firstly, the characters. The most obvious is having a romance between a 15-year old boy and a 25-year old woman. Not that age gap is an issue in relationships, but because the boy is a minor and the film therefore had a bit of a sour taste in the mouth being a 'love story'.Also, none of the characters were likable. No, not even the leads Alana and Gary. I mean, was this supposed to be a romantic film? Gary wanted to be with Alana from the moment he saw her, and when he got the chance he suddenly didn't want her anymore. Then, when she didn't want him anymore, he wanted her again. Then not, then he did, then she didn't, then she did... oh whatever!! As for Alana, she threw herself at every man she met! Wow, now there's romance for you (pffff!!!!!)With so many characters coming and going, I completely lost track of them and the film simply felt like a bunch of short stories gelled together to make one movie. As for Gary, I didn't find this character believable. This guy had so many mood changes that it was hard to summarize him. He is an actor and entrepreneur, and businessman at the age of fifteen...I also found the film slow moving with not all that much interesting happening - or, at least, nothing that interested me. This is not my kind of movie, and found it a bit boring since the 'love story' was anything but romantic. So, where did I want the movie to go? Honestly, I didn't care because I didn't root for any of the characters. I certainly didn't care for Gary and Alana being a couple, that's for sure!On a positive note, the performances are very good.",wait was this supposed be romantic,i was curious about films title as it turns out film is named after record store chain called licorice pizza also according director paul thomas anderson both licorice pizza resonate with childhood memories he liked sound that coming age movie i have several issues with this highly acclaimed film firstly characters most obvious is having romance between 15 year old boy 25 year old woman not that age gap is issue relationships but because boy is minor film therefore had bit sour taste mouth being love story also none characters were likable no not even leads alana gary i mean was this supposed be romantic film gary wanted be with alana moment he saw her when he got chance he suddenly didnt want her anymore then when she didnt want him anymore he wanted her again then not then he did then she didnt then she did oh whatever as alana she threw herself at every man she met wow now theres romance you pffff with so many characters coming going i completely lost track them film simply felt like bunch short stories gelled together make one movie as gary i didnt find this character believable this guy had so many mood changes that it was hard summarize him he is actor entrepreneur businessman at age fifteen i also found film slow moving with not all that much interesting happening or at least nothing that interested me this is not my kind movie found it bit boring since love story was anything but romantic so where did i want movie go honestly i didnt care because i didnt root any characters i certainly didnt care gary alana being couple thats sure positive note performances are very good,0.5293696118696121,0.1694203019203019,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.33}"
5.0,Bored two run...and run and run.,"Licorice Pizza comes across as if it was written on the fly. A jumble of ill fitting scenes with quirky adults and hip cameos (Sean Penn, Tom Waits, Bradley Cooper) it banks its edge on two average looking characters, Gary and Alana and their age gap; precocious 15 year old boy, 25 year old woman, both annoyingly overplayed by Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman.Gary meets Alana at a student yearbook (ID?) photo session. He's bewitched and pursues her. She bites and the two enter into an on again off again relationship that alas is rife with heartache and pain as they start a water bed business together. His obsession with Alana however begins to cool. She seeks and enters into more age appropriate relationships but they fail to advance. Gary meanwhile has opened a pinball business but cannot get over Alana and runs into the night in search of her.Pizza has its moments but very few with some imaginative incidentals and arch characterization that soon become contrived and repetitive. An absurdist rom-com with the fuel crisis as key backdrop it seems content to be sparingly funny as it incoherently moves from scene to scene of hodgepodge editing and poorly lit cinematography. Director PT Anderson seems to be missing in action with overlong scenes of drive by tracking and trail off dialogue with heavy handed interplay between the two leads as well as ancillary characters doing their darndest to be unctuous and annoying.

3.0,"Well made, but utterly pointless","I really wanted to like this film but it felt like there was absolutely nothing there. I didn't understand why these two would be a fit for each other, they really were not. The film was it of nonsensical diatribe, the movie just did not make sense on any level, it wasn't funny, although there were a couple moments that were a chuckle, but it was just a tiring story. It was a good period production, but what a waste.I was only able to get through it with a sense of long-suffering pain and difficulty. There are a lot of good movies out there, please please don't waste your time or wait for it streaming or DVD at least, and that way you can fast forward through the nonsense scenes.It felt very, very manipulative and it felt very, very indulgent on the part of Anderson.",well made but utterly pointless,i really wanted like this film but it felt like there was absolutely nothing there i didnt understand why these two would be fit each other they really were not film was it nonsensical diatribe movie just did not make sense any level it wasnt funny although there were couple moments that were chuckle but it was just tiring story it was good period production but what waste i was only able get through it with sense long suffering pain difficulty there are lot good movies out there please please dont waste your time or wait it streaming or dvd at least that way you can fast forward through nonsense scenes it felt very very manipulative it felt very very indulgent part anderson,0.4766666666666668,0.1525,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.25}"
4.0,VIEWS ON FILM review of Licorice Pizza,"The odd title of 2021's Licorice Pizza doesn't add up to much. Licorice Pizza the movie? Well it doesn't add up to much either. The film's blueprint involves a 15-year-old boy and a 25-year-old girl hanging out together in Southern California circa 1973. Why these two would ever have anything to do with each other or even be attracted to each other is well, beyond me.So yeah, Licorice Pizza is a comedy-drama that saunters and irks. It's like a series of random, ""Me Decade"" scenes that sort of taper off into the wind. The leads (Alana Haim, Cooper Hoffman) are not horrible, they're just dupes of automation. They begrudgingly do whatever Paul Thomas Anderson's implausible screenplay tells them to.Speaking of Anderson, well he's the director. Once the boy genius behind my favorite flick of all time (Boogie Nights), Paul Thomas Anderson has now regressed to the point of jumbled-ness. With Licorice Pizza, he dips back into the 70s again butchering the almighty cinematic form. There's no continuity, no lucid story, no scripted 411.So OK, Anderson knows where to put the camera and yeah, his soundtracks are earthy and retro (this one is good but lacks a little freshness). Still, you can't help but wish PTA would spend two-plus hours on something more than a messy, bipolar character study. In truth, I was annoyed by Alana Haim's Alana Kane to the point where I wanted to shake the wishy-washy out of her. I mean what a royal pain in the butt.Per the last paragraph, I said that Licorice Pizza was a messy film. True dat. It could learn age-old wisdom from a tidy one. Licorice Pizza is also cock and bull film. I mean you'd have to believe that Hoffman's Gary Valentine could own a pinball arcade, successfully mack on a twentysomething, and manage a waterbed factory as a blackhead juvenile. Wha??Add pointless cameos (I'm talking to you Bradley Cooper and Sean Penn) and fading personas whose plot threads add to nil and you have the movie equivalent of a failed competitor on The Gong Show.

5.0,"Unknown leading characters arent charismatic whatsoever. Too bad. Not dramatic or thrilling, neither really funny. Kinda tedious to be honest...","The story is simple. Teenagers falling in love in the seventies. There really isnt anything more to this story. A bit of a bummer!I am really disappointed that this is the best that director P. T Anderson had to offer. I have seen better days, much better...The bad: one of the lesser movies by director P. T Anderson, because the leading characters are unknowns, who are simply lacking charisma of the likes of brilliant A-list actors, like Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hofmann, Tom Cruise etc, who were starring in P. T Anderson's movies before...Forget about the leading actor being the son of Philip Seymour Hofmann, the guy just hasnt got the charisma of his father, nowhere near!The few (very short) supporting roles by A-list actors like Sean Penn, Tom Waits and Bradley Cooper may sound interesting, but when they act together with these unknown leading actors, they only accentuate the LACK OF CHARISMA of these leading uncharismatic unknown actors. A bit painful to watch.More bad: there is definitely a lack of drama and thrill. It really does become a bit tedious after an hour and that's a first for me when watching a P. T Anderson movie.Most people did come to see it because of an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. That nomination is rather laughable, because P. T. Anderson has made several movies worthy of an Oscar, but this is NOT one of them. Not bad, but it certainly aint brilliant either.Not any good? Famous director P. T Anderson always delivers.

5.0,An Aesthetic Masterpiece That Is Also Devoid Of Any Discernible Plot Or Meaning,"What an experience watching ""Licorice Pizza"" was. In terms of aesthetic qualities like the ability to put the viewer in a setting (in this case 1970s Los Angeles), a wonderful soundtrack, some rollicking fun sequences, and phenomenal cinematography. Truly a technical masterpiece in nearly every sense.Sadly, ""Licorice Pizza"" is also not all that great of a film for one very specific reason: it completely and utterly lacks a plot or overall meaning to all the technical expertise.For a very basic overview, the movie tells the story of Gary (Cooper Hoffman), a high school student with a taste for showbiz, and Alana (Alana Haim), a 25-year-old Jewish ""Valley Girl"" stuck in neutral but always looking for the next adventure. As the two circle around each other trying to determine their romantic wants/needs, they stumble in and out of any number of period-specific historical events/schemes, such as a fuel shortage, waterbed craze, and pinball machine ban being lifted, to name a few.Like I said, ""Licorice Pizza"" is truly remarkable at setting a scene. I felt like I was back in time and nothing ever broke that illusion. I was also extremely impressed by the acting performances from newcomers (at least to the big screen) Hoffman & Haim. They are more than capable of carrying the entire film, which is exactly what they are asked to do here.But when the credits rolled--and even some time after--I'm struggling to figure out any discernible value or lasting concepts to take from the experience. In a certain sense, the viewing experience (plot-wise) felt like a cipher to which I wasn't given the key. A whole bunch of mini-escapades transpire--all at least somewhat entertaining--and the movie just ends. No more, no less.I very much liken ""Licorice Pizza"" to 2019's ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"", though I have to say I liked that Tarentino film a bit more because even it hewed to the plot--not just the spirit--of the current events it was depicting. Here, director Paul Thomas Anderson creates a movie that is almost entirely aesthetic and eschews plot/meaning entirely. As such, it is difficult for me to grade it as ""good"" or ""bad"", hence the right-down-the-middle five stars.",aesthetic masterpiece that is also devoid any discernible plot or meaning,what experience watching licorice pizza was terms aesthetic qualities like ability put viewer setting this case 1970s los angeles wonderful soundtrack some rollicking fun sequences phenomenal cinematography truly technical masterpiece nearly every sense sadly licorice pizza is also not all that great film one very specific reason it completely utterly lacks plot or overall meaning all technical expertise very basic overview movie tells story gary cooper hoffman high school student with taste showbiz alana alana haim 25 year old jewish valley girl stuck neutral but always looking next adventure as two circle around each other trying determine their romantic wants needs they stumble out any number period specific historical events schemes such as fuel shortage waterbed craze pinball machine ban being lifted name few like i said licorice pizza is truly remarkable at setting scene i felt like i was back time nothing ever broke that illusion i was also extremely impressed by acting performances newcomers at least big screen hoffman haim they are more than capable carrying entire film which is exactly what they are asked do here but when credits rolled even some time after im struggling figure out any discernible value or lasting concepts take experience certain sense viewing experience plot wise felt like cipher which i wasnt given key whole bunch mini escapades transpire all at least somewhat entertaining movie just ends no more no less i very much liken licorice pizza 2019s once upon time hollywood though i have say i liked that tarentino film bit more because even it hewed plot not just spirit current events it was depicting here director paul thomas anderson creates movie that is almost entirely aesthetic eschews plot meaning entirely as such it is difficult me grade it as good or bad hence right down middle five stars,0.4081136621315193,0.12004960317460318,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
6.0,Muddled With Interesting Details,"Alana Haim admits to being 25, and may be 28. She has no idea what she wants to do. Cooper Hoffman is 15, a successful child actor, a budding entrepreneur -- waterbeds and newly decriminalized pinball machines -- and wants her.Paul Thomas Anderson's latest movie is set, like Tarrantino's ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, in Los Angeles some time in the 1960s or 1970s -- the scripts make Leave It To Beaver contemporaneous with the Oil Crisis. Anderson takes a viewpoint that is more realistic, more sympathetic, and at the same time, more cynical. His camera looks at its subjects like 1970s cameras did; people are not flattered by the 1970s clothes they wear, and the visible architecture is tired and ugly. And no one approves of the relationship between the leads, not even Miss Haim.The movie is filled out with contemporary individuals, some appearing under their real names -- John C. Reilly appears as Fred Gwynne in Munsters make-up, and Bradley Cooper as Jon Peters -- while others show up under pseudonyms -- Christine Ebersole is Lucy Doolittle, clearly a drunken, foul-mouthed Lucille Ball hyping a thinly disguised YOURS, MINE, AND OURS.As for the story, well, it's like most of Anderson's movies, a tale about not particularly likeable people trying to be happy in a world that doesn't approve of anything.

4.0,A blip,"Paul Thomas Anderson has written and directed so many excellent films that it saddens me to declare this one to be underwhelming, but that's the way it is. It feels like one, long in-joke masquerading as a coming-of-age movie. Lots of talent involved, including, fortunately, Alana Haim, around whom the movie seems to have been built, given the rest of her family play the rest of her character's family. That's all fine and funny. But there's something icky in the presence of Hollywood princes and princesses such as Cooper Hoffman, Willa Hoffman, Tallulah Hoffman, Sasha Spielberg, Dexter Demme. Not to mention Leonard di Caprio's dad. George. It's as if we're intruding on a home movie. Maybe that was the idea. If so, I'm surprised that Mr Anderson didn't realise how patronising that might seem.There are minor joys in the bravura turns of Christine Ebersole, Tom Waits, Sean Penn and Bradley Cooper, though perhaps the last goes so over-the-top he's probably in orbit by now.Come back soon, Paul Thomas Anderson, and bring us another good movie.

2.0,An Emperors New Clothes movie for me,"My Review - Liquorice Pizza My Rating 2/10It will be along time before I ever watch another ""Coming of Age ."" movie or any movie that involves Paul Thomas Anderson the Director Writer Producer of Liquorice Pizza.It may be a generation divide but it's a divide I never want to cross again the only aspect that I enjoyed about this movie was a few of the nostalgic 1970's pop hits.The story for what it's worth and it's not worth much is about two people one not so young immature 25 year old woman Alana Kane and Gary Valentine a podgy Ron Weasley look alike 15 year old teenager who has the hots for Alana . They spend most of the movie running around together selling water beds in the San Fernando Valley in 1973.I couldn't help thinking if the genders and ages were swapped around the film would probably be called Carnal Knowledge .The critics obviously love this movie and it's unbelievably nominated for 3 Oscar's Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay while a film like Guillermo Del Toro's superb Nightmare Alley is virtually ignored.The last coming of age movie I recall as annoying as this was the 2019 movie Booksmart but at least I enjoyed the cast in that and it was about real teenage angst not one teenager and a 25 year old woman.The two stars in this film Alana Haim who plays 25 year old Alana and Cooper Hoffman as 15 year old Garry I found a very odd couple I suppose that was intentional?Their Acting ability was ok I suppose but I thought they were mismatched physically and intellectually in fact they're not really romantically involved much at all ? Or their involvement is a very one sided affair.Liquorice Pizza is a puzzling combination of flavours that to me are as unappealing as the title suggests even cameos from Bradley Cooper as Jon Peter's Barbra Streisand's ex boyfriend and Sean Penn as Jack Holden couldn't make this movie a tasty dish for me.I only have one more 2022 Best Picture nominated movie to see before the awards are announced ""Drive My Car ""I hope it's better than this mishmash .",emperors new clothes movie me,my review liquorice pizza my rating 2 10it will be along time before i ever watch another coming age movie or any movie that involves paul thomas anderson director writer producer liquorice pizza it may be generation divide but its divide i never want cross again only aspect that i enjoyed about this movie was few nostalgic 1970s pop hits story what its worth its not worth much is about two people one not so young immature 25 year old woman alana kane gary valentine podgy ron weasley look alike 15 year old teenager who has hots alana they spend most movie running around together selling water beds san fernando valley 1973 i couldnt help thinking if genders ages were swapped around film would probably be called carnal knowledge critics obviously love this movie its unbelievably nominated 3 oscars best picture best director best screenplay while film like guillermo del toros superb nightmare alley is virtually ignored last coming age movie i recall as annoying as this was 2019 movie booksmart but at least i enjoyed cast that it was about real teenage angst not one teenager 25 year old woman two stars this film alana haim who plays 25 year old alana cooper hoffman as 15 year old garry i found very odd couple i suppose that was intentional their acting ability was ok i suppose but i thought they were mismatched physically intellectually fact theyre not really romantically involved much at all or their involvement is very one sided affair liquorice pizza is puzzling combination flavours that me are as unappealing as title suggests even cameos bradley cooper as jon peters barbra streisands ex boyfriend sean penn as jack holden couldnt make this movie tasty dish me i only have one more 2022 best picture nominated movie see before awards are announced drive my car i hope its better than this mishmash,0.40631313131313124,0.1928127428127428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.34}"

3.0,"Show-offy, empty, kind of desperate","A 15-year-old boy in the '70s lives like an adult, courting a grown woman and running two businesses. It might be some high-concept Hollywood kids' comedy like Big, except it's all done out in artsy grainy realism so you can almost believe it - if not feel much for these characters who seem largely without vulnerabilities or struggles.The implicitly weird premise and generally missing emotion might suggest Anderson got too up in his head constructing some riddle or logic problem - but indicating what? About the most I can see is, it continues his interest in force-of-nature types and the mystery of their instinctive, amoral, self-absorbed successes. Perhaps now showing a kid like this, Anderson's saying we all started growing up faster after the sixties? Or the boy businessman, peddling waterbeds and pinball to me-generation hedonists, is part of the coming yuppie wave?I dunno and the problem is I don't really care - or believe all this code-breaking is deserved or to much purpose. Drifting like a dull biopic from one disconnected episode to another, the film seems as bereft of meaning as of story. The only idea, really, appears to have been to corruscatingly stud the surface with brilliantly observed period detail, florid dialogue and extravagant side characters - all of which, adding up to nothing, feels overwrought and tediously pleased with itself.It's a perfect case study, then, in how you can execute near flawlessly throughout - though actually, most of the jokes fall flat - but if your movie's not really about anything, it's still bad.

3.0,I wish I could endorse this movie.,"But I watched, I looked, and I couldn't find anything there. It's aimless. It doesn't start anywhere, it doesn't end anywhere, and in between it doesn't bother to go anywhere. Other than ""but it's a young love slice of life in the early-70s Valley"" - which is just a copout for not having a narrative arc - about the most interesting thing is the conflict-that-should-have-happened-but-didn't with Bradley Cooper's Jon Peters. That was hilariously manic, and seemed to presage SoCal's cocaine obsession by five or ten years.To be honest, though, what bothered me most was that the title referred to *nothing*. I used to go to LA in the early 80s and buy a lot of records, and Licorice Pizza was one of the stores I frequented. So I'd hoped for a little selfish nostalgia and was disappointed when the store didn't feature in the movie AT ALL. So other than being an odd name to anyone not familiar with the music scene at the time, there was no reason to choose it, and I felt kinda robbed.",i wish i could endorse this movie,but i watched i looked i couldnt find anything there its aimless it doesnt start anywhere it doesnt end anywhere between it doesnt bother go anywhere other than but its young love slice life early 70s valley which is just copout not having narrative arc about most interesting thing is conflict that should have happened but didnt with bradley coopers jon peters that was hilariously manic seemed presage socals cocaine obsession by five or ten years be honest though what bothered me most was that title referred nothing i used go la early 80s buy lot records licorice pizza was one stores i frequented so id hoped little selfish nostalgia was disappointed when store didnt feature movie at all so other than being odd name anyone not familiar with music scene at time there was no reason choose it i felt kinda robbed,0.5147058823529411,0.07990196078431375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.44, 'Fear': 0.28}"
,Muted romance,"I love this movie but can't explain why, left the cinema same way I felt after watching ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"". Don't really know what to say apart from I enjoyed it. Was it the era it's based in, was it the chemistry the characters shared, was it the way it was filmed, the dialogues, or was it the idyll charm Alana and Gary created? I don't know. It felt like the writers just started writing with no actual plot line, let the story flow and develop on it's own, because I can tell you what happened in the movie but don't really know what the movie's about yet it was still perfect the way it was. Felt like just watching life unfold for the characters. It wasn't complicated, at no point do you feel the script was altered to make it more witty, funny or dramatic, everything was just natural. I think more movies like this should be made. I wasn't around in the 70's, but movies like this make it feel like I'm right there with them; nostalgia to a time I never knew.

7.0,A Total Vibe Movie,"A total vibe movie that you're either going to enjoy or not depending on how into that vibe you are.Paul Thomas Anderson's latest is a nostalgic romcom of sorts about a teenager and the much older woman he wants to have a romance with in 1970s California. The film is obviously made by someone with first-hand experience of what it was like to grow up near L. A.'s entertainment industry, and the film, which is more a series of vignettes than a continuous narrative, captures the weirdness, desperation, and sometimes scariness of famous people living in a vacuum.The film's biggest asset is Alana Haim, playing either a 25 year old or 28 year old (a blink and you'll miss it line throws some doubt on her actual age) who's oppressive Jewish household makes the antics of a child star high schooler (Cooper Hoffman, son of Phillip Seymour) at first a welcome distraction and later leads to an endearing bond between the two. The movie is winsome and enjoyable as long as it focuses on these two and their prickly relationship, but it's derailed by two lengthy segments featuring Sean Penn and Bradley Cooper that aren't as funny as Anderson seems to think they are and flab out the film's running time.Also, much as I enjoyed the film while watching it, I couldn't shake an extreme feeling of ickiness when I started to think back on it. The age difference between Haim and Cooper is treated as mostly a non-issue within the world of the film, and their romance is served straight up -- we're obviously supposed to be rooting for them to be together. But if this were a movie about a 25 year old man romancing a 15 year old girl, it would play quite differently, and the double standard bothered me. I also felt like the script let Haim down. She's so likable and such a good actress that I was disappointed her character didn't have more growth. She's a young woman who hasn't seen much of the world but starts to thanks to Hoffman, but I wish the movie had been more about her learning that, much as she likes Hoffman as a friend, she's too old for him and has more potential than that of being his girlfriend and sidekick.So, overall a mixed bag of a movie for me, though I was entertained watching it and would recommend it to others.Grade: A-",total vibe movie,total vibe movie that youre either going enjoy or not depending how into that vibe you are paul thomas andersons latest is nostalgic romcom sorts about teenager much older woman he wants have romance with 1970s california film is obviously made by someone with first hand experience what it was like grow up near l s entertainment industry film which is more series vignettes than continuous narrative captures weirdness desperation sometimes scariness famous people living vacuum films biggest asset is alana haim playing either 25 year old or 28 year old blink youll miss it line throws some doubt her actual age whos oppressive jewish household makes antics child star high schooler cooper hoffman son phillip seymour at first welcome distraction later leads endearing bond between two movie is winsome enjoyable as long as it focuses these two their prickly relationship but its derailed by two lengthy segments featuring sean penn bradley cooper that arent as funny as anderson seems think they are flab out films running time also much as i enjoyed film while watching it i couldnt shake extreme feeling ickiness when i started think back it age difference between haim cooper is treated as mostly non issue within world film their romance is served straight up were obviously supposed be rooting them be together but if this were movie about 25 year old man romancing 15 year old girl it would play quite differently double standard bothered me i also felt like script let haim down shes so likable such good actress that i was disappointed her character didnt have more growth shes young woman who hasnt seen much world but starts thanks hoffman but i wish movie had been more about her learning that much as she likes hoffman as friend shes too old him has more potential than that being his girlfriend sidekick so overall mixed bag movie me though i was entertained watching it would recommend it others grade,0.4299782135076252,0.16838779956427014,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.31}"
4.0,A throwback coming of age story,"""Licorice Pizza"" is a coming of age story set in 1973's Los Angeles-Encino.
