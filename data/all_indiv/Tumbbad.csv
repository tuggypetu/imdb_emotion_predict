9.0,"The constant rain, vivid local landscapes, unique storyline n the amazeballs ending. If only the subject of true horror 'Sati' was explored more.","The film begins with top notch cinematography.The story is unique, bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed.The story is based on the spooky Indian mythology/horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food.One family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion. Cos of this the family is ostracised.The mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion. The wife/mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand-job n while she gives him the hand-job, she asks him to hurry up, to which the oldie replies in a funny way.The wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon's idol.The house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism.The house is a striking image on top a hill, reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside.There are no close-by neighbors, as the family is on their own after their ostracisation.There is something very trance like feel in this movie, especially the weather n the locations.The constant rain and vivid, well filmed local landscapes are characters themselves.It is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere.Kudos to the cinematographer n director, they did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear.The director also did a nice job of building a concrete, hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing.The story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled.If u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years, u will see all the details.Attention has been paid in the local ethnic details, the time period, costumes n architecture.Also the moral subject of greed n lust are handled very well.The subject of Sati n female subjugation are sprinkled but not explored.Soham Shah and the kids gave noteworthy performances.Appreciate Soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film.Kudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending.Love to see a prequel or sequel with more emphasis on the true horror Sati n the demon's backstory.",constant rain vivid local landscapes unique storyline n amazeballs ending if only subject true horror sati was explored more,film begins with top notch cinematography story is unique bringing mythology n moral subject human greed story is based spooky indian mythology horror folktale demon who is loaded with gold but deprived food one family has been able revive demon by building temple inside isolated n creepy mansion cos this family is ostracised mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only old father resides mansion wife mistress do visit mansion everyday give old husband hand job n while she gives him hand job she asks him hurry up which oldie replies funny way wife also inquires about gold coin which is kept near demons idol house family is walking distance away mansion which is inhabited by wife n her two kids along with great great grandmother old husband who is being cursed live forever after bite demon n old hag needs be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort cannibalism house is striking image top hill reminding viewers isolation countryside there are no close by neighbors as family is their own after their ostracisation there is something very trance like feel this movie especially weather n locations constant rain vivid well filmed local landscapes are characters themselves it is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere kudos cinematographer n director they did fantastic job creating perpetual palpable sense tension fear director also did nice job building concrete hypnotizing story without ever having sacrifice pacing story takes place span thirty years n details r appropriately handled if u notice mansion beginning n after fifteen years u will see all details attention has been paid local ethnic details time period costumes n architecture also moral subject greed n lust are handled very well subject sati n female subjugation are sprinkled but not explored soham shah kids gave noteworthy performances appreciate soham n producers producing such good horror film kudos director fantastic twist ending love see prequel or sequel with more emphasis true horror sati n demons backstory,0.528396311291048,0.16788942052099945,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,A Welcome Maturity In Indian Horror,"Original, unsettling & enveloped with a dreadful aura, Tumbbad is a wicked blend of fantasy & folklore that makes fab use of its rich & riveting mythology to deliver a dark, delirious nightmare, and is all the more strengthened by its claustrophobic set pieces, ominous camerawork & unrelenting score.Directed by Rahi Anil Barve, the most impressive bit about his first feature is that it is devoid of the awful gimmicks that destroy most Bollywood horrors. It retains its Indian roots, relies on its chilling ambience to ratchet the tension, and doesn't go overboard with most elements, thus keeping the interest alive until the end.The remote location, period setting, dilapidated sets, perpetual rain & pitch dark alleys contribute plenty in creating a sense of apprehension that keeps us riveted throughout. The sophisticated camerawork & menacing score further amplify the unsettling vibe. Performances, however, are a bit overdone and certainly could've used some restraint.Overall, Tumbbad is a welcome entry in Bollywood horror with a level of maturity that most of its counterparts lack. Scoring high marks on storytelling & technical fronts, it is a polished piece of work that puts greater emphasis on atmosphere to derive the chills instead of resorting to tiresome clich√©s, and is neatly executed by the debutant filmmaker. Definitely worth a shot.",welcome maturity indian horror,original unsettling enveloped with dreadful aura tumbbad is wicked blend fantasy folklore that makes fab use its rich riveting mythology deliver dark delirious nightmare is all more strengthened by its claustrophobic set pieces ominous camerawork unrelenting score directed by rahi anil barve most impressive bit about his first feature is that it is devoid awful gimmicks that destroy most bollywood horrors it retains its indian roots relies its chilling ambience ratchet tension doesnt go overboard with most elements thus keeping interest alive until end remote location period setting dilapidated sets perpetual rain pitch dark alleys contribute plenty creating sense apprehension that keeps us riveted throughout sophisticated camerawork menacing score further amplify unsettling vibe performances however are bit overdone certainly couldve used some restraint overall tumbbad is welcome entry bollywood horror with level maturity that most its counterparts lack scoring high marks storytelling technical fronts it is polished piece work that puts greater emphasis atmosphere derive chills instead resorting tiresome clich s is neatly executed by debutant filmmaker definitely worth shot,0.5784217687074831,0.04783673469387754,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Definitely original a masterpiece,"TumbbadWith this movie , indian film making has definitely gained a certain level of maturity . I have lost my faith in horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced in india, in past all they do is cut copy paste. This movie is definitely original. They do not use sudden creepy sound effects or the old tricks of moving camera over the shoulder. The director completely relies on the story to work and it works. The camera lenses are well used to portray the claustrophobic scenes . The production value is top notch , totally uplifts the movie. Most of the scene includes rain , the greens and a dark environment which works superbly . Director duo do not try to scare you through formula film making methods. They don't even try to do that ,it's the story and the environment which worked for them. Most of the scenes are designed in low light conditions but the contrast is high enough to attract your eye's attention towards the character. Actors have pulled there character successfully specially Soham Shah who is also the producer. A thousand year old myth , greed, deep dark corner of a humen's psyche , a monster (within and out too), ajay atul's precise background score , the spellbound scenic value and a world class direction . There is so much more this movie has to offer. The masala movie watcher may not able to appreciate the movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves a sensible class of audience.",definitely original masterpiece,tumbbadwith this movie indian film making has definitely gained certain level maturity i have lost my faith horror cum thriller zone movies which are produced india past all they do is cut copy paste this movie is definitely original they do not use sudden creepy sound effects or old tricks moving camera over shoulder director completely relies story work it works camera lenses are well used portray claustrophobic scenes production value is top notch totally uplifts movie most scene includes rain greens dark environment which works superbly director duo do not try scare you through formula film making methods they dont even try do that its story environment which worked them most scenes are designed low light conditions but contrast is high enough attract your eyes attention towards character actors have pulled there character successfully specially soham shah who is also producer thousand year old myth greed deep dark corner humens psyche monster within out too ajay atuls precise background score spellbound scenic value world class direction there is so much more this movie has offer masala movie watcher may not able appreciate movie as it must be but this movie definitely deserves sensible class audience,0.5433743842364532,0.13556650246305418,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,Not really Bollywood,"This was something that may give may give 'goosebumps' to the makers of Hollywood movies. This is a movie that will add to the Indian cinema a tons but unfortunately Indian cinema is not prepared for it. The viewers are not prepared for it. We are still into watching that regular melodrama and item songs. I was fantasized for the making of Stree and acting and drama that made it. But after watching this I can proudly appreciate the concept and depth that this movie offers. This shows us what a thriller can be like. The biggest attraction of the movie was the story that was very symbolic of the human craving. Human craving takes you into darkness is the message of the movie . Sohum Shah has played his part powerfully and so has Anita Date. The direction was not orthodox and was original. This is the first movie of its type and definitely Hollywood can learn from it. This is a much an improvement over the Hollywood stories like Annabelle, Conjuring. A must entertainment for all. Watch it, especially if you are not into watching the regular drama that Indian cinema offers like Race 3",not really bollywood,this was something that may give may give goosebumps makers hollywood movies this is movie that will add indian cinema tons but unfortunately indian cinema is not prepared it viewers are not prepared it we are still into watching that regular melodrama item songs i was fantasized making stree acting drama that made it but after watching this i can proudly appreciate concept depth that this movie offers this shows us what thriller can be like biggest attraction movie was story that was very symbolic human craving human craving takes you into darkness is message movie sohum shah has played his part powerfully so has anita date direction was not orthodox was original this is first movie its type definitely hollywood can learn it this is much improvement over hollywood stories like annabelle conjuring must entertainment all watch it especially if you are not into watching regular drama that indian cinema offers like race 3,0.39143049932523616,0.08026315789473686,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.46}"
10.0,Imagine if this film got more publicity...,"Would you believe me if I tell you the budget of this film is just 5 crores (nearly $700k)? Before you let that fact sink in, would you believe me if I also tell you that this is the director's first ever film? Rahi Anil Barve - remember this name. You might need to speak it when someone asks you who your favourite Bollywood director is. This film was made for 6 years. Keep reading, I will tell you why it took so long.Tumbbad is set in the village of the same name in Maharashtra. The story is set during the colonial period, and also some of it just after the independence. Though the village exists in real, it is nothing like what has been described in the film. According to the film the village has been cursed for writing the name of Hastar, a demon son of a Goddess who gave birth to 160 million gods. Because of the curse it is always raining in Tumbbad. Since the budget of this film was so low, the filming was only done during monsoon season when it was actually raining in the village. That's how low the budget of the film is - they couldn't even afford fake rain so they had to wait for 6 years to complete the filming.In spite of the low budget, it does not give the feeling of being cheap at all. In fact if I didn't know better, I'd think this is a very expensive film. The actors aren't popular, but I don't see where the problem is over there. How many of us knew the names of all the actors from Baahubali? Still we watched it, right? So I'd think this is also a regional film. The acting is phenomenal. The horror scenes absolutely give me the creeps. It's perfect in every sense. Even the ending is left on an ambiguous note, enough to leave a shrill down anyone's spine. The posters of this film are also very good, and it's a shame to say that the worst one has been used over here. Look up for the other posters on Google Images.The reason why Tumbbad failed to cross a huge commercial mark is because it wasn't advertised at all. If I hadn't read an answer on Quora that said it should have been sent to the Oscars instead of Gully Boy, I'd have never even known about its existence. There was literally no talk of it. Sure it has a low budget for making the film, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't spend in the marketing at all. It was so awesome, I for one would have definitely seen it if I had heard about it before. Also the only way to watch it now is through Prime, which will show you this film only if you type the correct spelling in the search box. It's a shame that you can't watch this film unless you know specifically what you're looking for.I really admire the dedication of the director to make this film. He clearly knew this film wasn't going to be earning those big bucks, yet he continued to make it. This is what happens when you have directors who treat their work not as products but rather as works of art. I really aspire to be a filmmaker of that type. This film will be a very big lesson to me. I wish Rahi Anil Barve a very successful and prosperous career in the future.",imagine if this film got more publicity,would you believe me if i tell you budget this film is just 5 crores nearly 700k before you let that fact sink would you believe me if i also tell you that this is directors first ever film rahi anil barve remember this name you might need speak it when someone asks you who your favourite bollywood director is this film was made 6 years keep reading i will tell you why it took so long tumbbad is set village same name maharashtra story is set during colonial period also some it just after independence though village exists real it is nothing like what has been described film according film village has been cursed writing name hastar demon son goddess who gave birth 160 million gods because curse it is always raining tumbbad since budget this film was so low filming was only done during monsoon season when it was actually raining village thats how low budget film is they couldnt even afford fake rain so they had wait 6 years complete filming spite low budget it does not give feeling being cheap at all fact if i didnt know better id think this is very expensive film actors arent popular but i dont see where problem is over there how many us knew names all actors baahubali still we watched it right so id think this is also regional film acting is phenomenal horror scenes absolutely give me creeps its perfect every sense even ending is left ambiguous note enough leave shrill down anyones spine posters this film are also very good its shame say that worst one has been used over here look up other posters google images reason why tumbbad failed cross huge commercial mark is because it wasnt advertised at all if i hadnt read answer quora that said it should have been sent oscars instead gully boy id have never even known about its existence there was literally no talk it sure it has low budget making film but that doesnt mean they shouldnt spend marketing at all it was so awesome i one would have definitely seen it if i had heard about it before also only way watch it now is through prime which will show you this film only if you type correct spelling search box its shame that you cant watch this film unless you know specifically what youre looking i really admire dedication director make this film he clearly knew this film wasnt going be earning those big bucks yet he continued make it this is what happens when you have directors who treat their work not as products but rather as works art i really aspire be filmmaker that type this film will be very big lesson me i wish rahi anil barve very successful prosperous career future,0.5033887235449735,0.11932622354497353,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8.0,"""The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed.""","I have to say, that old grandmother was more horrifying than just about any movie monster you can think of, and I'm including Godzilla and Freddie Kruger in that statement. That was one ugly make-up job. The demon Hastar was no slouch either, but I did have to laugh the first time it defecated gold coins out it's butt. That was just a bit too outlandish. The film appears to be a cautionary tale about what greed does to a person, and as sins of the father are passed down to the son, the avarice has the tendency to perpetuate itself through the ages. The story is told in three chapters set about fifteen years apart, beginning around 1918 in the Western India village of Tumbbad, from which the movie takes it's name. It takes a doll made out of dough to summon the creature Hastar, which also has the tendency to distract it long enough to gather up the gold coins it produces. Multiple dolls suggest the distraction will last longer thereby allowing additional time to collect more gold coins, but instead, the surplus dolls summon an equal number of surplus demons. Another outcome of unintended consequences. I've seen over a dozen films out of India but this was the first true horror picture from that country. It was quite original in execution, with spectacular if terrifying imagery that's bound to cause nightmares for the more timid.",world has enough everyones need but not enough everyones greed,i have say that old grandmother was more horrifying than just about any movie monster you can think im including godzilla freddie kruger that statement that was one ugly make up job demon hastar was no slouch either but i did have laugh first time it defecated gold coins out its butt that was just bit too outlandish film appears be cautionary tale about what greed does person as sins father are passed down son avarice has tendency perpetuate itself through ages story is told three chapters set about fifteen years apart beginning around 1918 western india village tumbbad which movie takes its name it takes doll made out dough summon creature hastar which also has tendency distract it long enough gather up gold coins it produces multiple dolls suggest distraction will last longer thereby allowing additional time collect more gold coins but instead surplus dolls summon equal number surplus demons another outcome unintended consequences ive seen over dozen films out india but this was first true horror picture that country it was quite original execution with spectacular if terrifying imagery thats bound cause nightmares more timid,0.4669191919191919,0.041792929292929284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,Dark and deep üëç,"-----A young boy Vinayak Rao is affected by a personal tragedy. His encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed. He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions. The best form of horror is one which plays with your mind. The fear of the uncertain and the unknown is what evokes the strongest emotions. Tumbbad is a perfect example of a film that creates a surreal illusion. This psychological horror has its traditional moments of blood and gore, but the most promising part of this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out of ordinary men. A greedy human can be a lot more malicious than a cursed supernatural entity. Ideas like that make Tumbbad a real mind-bender and the film's top-notch production design makes it a movie that truly reinvents the horror genre for Indian cinema. The film kicks off with a CGI sequence of gods and goddesses and a strong allegory of the destructive nature of greed. Tumbbad, an actual village in Maharashtra, becomes the fabric of this tale. Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing, but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre. This one is genuinely scary.",dark deep,young boy vinayak rao is affected by personal tragedy his encounter with wretched old lady who knows buried treasure sets him path greed he grows up explore local legend monster named hastar his gold medallions best form horror is one which plays with your mind fear uncertain unknown is what evokes strongest emotions tumbbad is perfect example film that creates surreal illusion this psychological horror has its traditional moments blood gore but most promising part this terrifying fable is that it makes monsters out ordinary men greedy human can be lot more malicious than cursed supernatural entity ideas like that make tumbbad real mind bender films top notch production design makes it movie that truly reinvents horror genre indian cinema film kicks off with cgi sequence gods goddesses strong allegory destructive nature greed tumbbad actual village maharashtra becomes fabric this tale tumbbad is moody atmospheric film some viewers may find film little too deep disturbing but fans hollywood horror films will be reminded memorable movies genre this one is genuinely scary,0.5016666666666666,0.07208333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.25}"

,"""I'll Sing You A Lullaby!""...","TUMBBAD is a small village in India where a shrine was built for a god named Hastar. He was the greedy, malevolent offspring of the goddess of prosperity, and was only spared from obliteration by the other gods, on the condition that he never be worshiped.This is not a spoiler, since it is told in the first few minutes of the film.What follows is the story of what happens when human and demonic desires intersect.

8.0,One of the Original best since long.,"TUMBAAD is a highly engrossing movie and a Visual treat. Original Story amidst a backdrop of folklore makes Tumbbad a delight. Though watched it at its initial screening at the Venice festival but writing this review after re-watch again.Story about greed that start from an ancient treasure hidden in a mansion. The process of reaching to that wealth and the desire to grab more of it and in the process going to any extent. I'll sum this movie in these couple of lines not giving the entire story and the plot. It has some Excellent background score and gripping screenplay. Does have some minor flaws that can be ignored. Overall, original story and folklore make it a worthy watch with a superlative effort from the actor and producer Soham Shah. Enjoy almost two hours of adventure with a seasoning of Horror and you will not be disappointed. Did read some weird reviews from critics mentioning it "" as an art film"" not for everybody and some even mentioning "" it has a lot of Marathi influence and Hindi speaking audience might not like it "" very sad Indeed. My request please do watch it.",one original best since long,tumbaad is highly engrossing movie visual treat original story amidst backdrop folklore makes tumbbad delight though watched it at its initial screening at venice festival but writing this review after re watch again story about greed that start ancient treasure hidden mansion process reaching that wealth desire grab more it process going any extent ill sum this movie these couple lines not giving entire story plot it has some excellent background score gripping screenplay does have some minor flaws that can be ignored overall original story folklore make it worthy watch with superlative effort actor producer soham shah enjoy almost two hours adventure with seasoning horror you will not be disappointed did read some weird reviews critics mentioning it as art film not everybody some even mentioning it has lot marathi influence hindi speaking audience might not like it very sad indeed my request please do watch it,0.598015873015873,0.13293650793650796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,Sheer Brilliance,This was a spine chilling tale of greed and its repercussions. Sohum Shah and Mohammed Samad play father and son in this brilliant story. Sohum Shah looks the part and acts well. Mohammad Samad is the star here. He steals the show. He plays two roles in this movie. The Second one being the grand mother. He does equally well in both roles. There is an eerie feeling as soon as the movie starts. The folk tale of a legendary god who was never worshiped because of his greed sets the context. Every scene has been shot with finesse. The locations are breath taking. The scenes keep you on the edge and the story moves at an even pace. Indian Horror is finally soaring new heights. Kudos to Anand Gandhi and Sohum Shah for producing this one and a big applause for the writer Rahi Anil Barve. This is a brilliant horror story set in an Indian village called Tumbbad.,sheer brilliance,this was spine chilling tale greed its repercussions sohum shah mohammed samad play father son this brilliant story sohum shah looks part acts well mohammad samad is star here he steals show he plays two roles this movie second one being grand mother he does equally well both roles there is eerie feeling as soon as movie starts folk tale legendary god who was never worshiped because his greed sets context every scene has been shot with finesse locations are breath taking scenes keep you edge story moves at even pace indian horror is finally soaring new heights kudos anand gandhi sohum shah producing this one big applause writer rahi anil barve this is brilliant horror story set indian village called tumbbad,0.7045454545454545,0.203030303030303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Making Indian film proud.,"This movie will definitely be in the conversation of the greatest Indian movies ever made. 50 years from now, people will be referring to this film as an absolute classic and masterpiece in the genre. Sohum Shah, take a bow. Whoever did the VFX and Makeup deserves all the awards. The story is so original and I felt the eerie atmosphere throughout the movie. Also, today's bollywood movies often try to show as much brightness in every scene. The fact that the cinematography of this film is so awesome, that it's dark, in the rain, just immerses you in the plot and the 1900s. I heard it took 6 years of hard work. Thank you for giving the Indian audience this amazing film. A big step for the future of Indian cinema",making indian film proud,this movie will definitely be conversation greatest indian movies ever made 50 years now people will be referring this film as absolute classic masterpiece genre sohum shah take bow whoever did vfx makeup deserves all awards story is so original i felt eerie atmosphere throughout movie also todays bollywood movies often try show as much brightness every scene fact that cinematography this film is so awesome that its dark rain just immerses you plot 1900s i heard it took 6 years hard work thank you giving indian audience this amazing film big step future indian cinema,0.6130952380952381,0.24285714285714288,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,Absolute Masterclass........,"Tumbbad is a Silky visual masterpiece Interwoven in a beautifully filled with suspense, mystery and horror. Only a very few Indian movies can match Tumbbad's Mind boggling artistic appeal, the credit should go entirely to the director and the whole crew of the film. The movie was shot over a period of multiple years and though it was completed in 2012, it was reshot again and completed in 2015 as the director was not completely happy with the first version. The script was in the making for almost a couple of decades and when it was ready many production houses walked out time and again due to the various differences. The final end product that we see today is a dedicated and sustained effort this dedicated core team. The movie is poetry in every department the standout being the Cinematography, editing, costumes design, production design, VFX, Music, shooting locations and layered acting. Though shot on a minuscule budget by today's standards, the work can be compared to the best of the best movies ever made, yes it is that good. I Normally never give ratings over 8 for any movie but this one deserves a full 10/10 for its visual pleasure and the way it works one's mind. This movie is a must for any movie lover all around the world with a disclaimer to be ready to get engulfed into the world of a Mystic Adventure which will be enthralled on your minds forever.",absolute masterclass,tumbbad is silky visual masterpiece interwoven beautifully filled with suspense mystery horror only very few indian movies can match tumbbads mind boggling artistic appeal credit should go entirely director whole crew film movie was shot over period multiple years though it was completed 2012 it was reshot again completed 2015 as director was not completely happy with first version script was making almost couple decades when it was ready many production houses walked out time again due various differences final end product that we see today is dedicated sustained effort this dedicated core team movie is poetry every department standout being cinematography editing costumes design production design vfx music shooting locations layered acting though shot minuscule budget by todays standards work can be compared best best movies ever made yes it is that good i normally never give ratings over 8 any movie but this one deserves full 10 10 its visual pleasure way it works ones mind this movie is must any movie lover all around world with disclaimer be ready get engulfed into world mystic adventure which will be enthralled your minds forever,0.502638888888889,0.18638888888888885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.32}"
