,Not for young children,"I confess that I had to watch this twice before I could properly assess it. It's definitely not a young children's film, as there's precious little to entertain them, but it does have much to consider for older children and (young) adults. As a rumination on what drives us all through life, this is very effective, but I do feel that the story lacks something for making Riley so isolated in her world. Perhaps if she interacted a bit more in the story, this would be a more involving film, but the reflections on lost innocence do add some poignancy and lift this film slightly above average.",not young children,i confess that i had watch this twice before i could properly assess it its definitely not young childrens film as theres precious little entertain them but it does have much consider older children young adults as rumination what drives us all through life this is very effective but i do feel that story lacks something making riley so isolated her world perhaps if she interacted bit more story this would be more involving film but reflections lost innocence do add some poignancy lift this film slightly above average,0.4487179487179488,0.17762820512820512,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.47}"
9.0,Classic for the new generation? Yes!,"I just knew this was gonna be amazing. Such a great idea for an animated movie, even by Pixar's standards. It's truly a perfectly executed vision that did not disappoint on almost all levels. There's a lot of fun to be had with this, it's one of the funnier and more thought provoking Pixar movies. The scene where Bing Bong disappears is also extremely sad. I could also tell that this is one of Pixar's more mature films, about the struggles of growing up. It explored Nostalgia for most of the movie without even using the word. When sadness touched a core memory and turned it blue, it was a symbol for Riley feeling nostalgic for her best memories. In my book, this is yet another Pixar classic.",classic new generation yes,i just knew this was gonna be amazing such great idea animated movie even by pixars standards its truly perfectly executed vision that did not disappoint almost all levels theres lot fun be had with this its one funnier more thought provoking pixar movies scene where bing bong disappears is also extremely sad i could also tell that this is one pixars more mature films about struggles growing up it explored nostalgia most movie without even using word when sadness touched core memory turned it blue it was symbol riley feeling nostalgic her best memories my book this is yet another pixar classic,0.5086174242424242,0.29810606060606065,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.5, 'Fear': 0.06}"
10.0,Best Pixar Since Toy Story,"After some ho-hum years and too many sequels, Pixar is back and better than ever with Inside Out, a boldly unique animated film that renews our faith in what a giant studio can do with an original concept. Docter combines the strengths of his two Pixar masterworks here: the endless inventiveness of Monster's Inc. and the poignant strength of Up. A truly fantastic mixture of fantasy-adventure-comedy and small-family-drama, it's a genius work of conception, execution and emotion that will go down in the annals of Disney animation as an instant and enduring classic. It follows Joy, the leading-emotion of an 11-year-old girl, as she tries to navigate a big change in her young life. Much like Toy Story 3, we're shown the inherent difficulties of growing up through a fresh viewpoint, learning what makes you ""you"". It's a convoluted idea that's nearly impossible to explain, and yet Pixar nails it, perfectly shifting between its parallel universes with ease. The humor throughout will undoubtedly have kids and adults in equal stitches, with fantastic turns from everyone, notably Poehler, Smith, Black, and Kind. However, this film's high-point may be the multiple emotional gut-punches that will reduce parents to tears. That fearlessness to be gloomy is basically the thesis of the film: true joy comes when every emotion is allowed to be recognized and dealt with healthfully. It's quite a psychologically complex stance to take for a film that manages to be so kid-friendly. This wonderful balancing act helps make Inside Out worthy of the ""M"" word (masterpiece) and gives it the distinction of being Pixar's best since the unparalleled Toy Story.",best pixar since toy story,after some ho hum years too many sequels pixar is back better than ever with inside out boldly unique animated film that renews our faith what giant studio can do with original concept docter combines strengths his two pixar masterworks here endless inventiveness monsters inc poignant strength up truly fantastic mixture fantasy adventure comedy small family drama its genius work conception execution emotion that will go down annals disney animation as instant enduring classic it follows joy leading emotion 11 year old girl as she tries navigate big change her young life much like toy story 3 were shown inherent difficulties growing up through fresh viewpoint learning what makes you you its convoluted idea thats nearly impossible explain yet pixar nails it perfectly shifting between its parallel universes with ease humor throughout will undoubtedly have kids adults equal stitches with fantastic turns everyone notably poehler smith black kind however this films high point may be multiple emotional gut punches that will reduce parents tears that fearlessness be gloomy is basically thesis film true joy comes when every emotion is allowed be recognized dealt with healthfully its quite psychologically complex stance take film that manages be so kid friendly this wonderful balancing act helps make inside out worthy m word masterpiece gives it distinction being pixars best since unparalleled toy story,0.5114245014245014,0.24541310541310546,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,Misery on a stick,"OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel – c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille – all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel – even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised – even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.",misery stick,ok playtimes over pixar now get over it this film is so plainly prequel c f references puberty button new emote console character rileys brain you will fail find anything entertaining value your 100 minute investment you may harbour fond memories toy story finding nemo incredibles ratatouille all unique funny thrilling entertaining but that is not what you will get with inside out joy after all is banished long term memory cant get back charge console since when was single emotion ever charge anyway inside out can be taken as metaphor poor sops who work disney corporation yes they started out with true optimism about life journey they had chosen with pixar then all sudden they are taken over by less than friendly peer compound this they are moved their original playpen new post industrial work lot all is grim sadness takes hold taints everything that is done even joy begins sob with sadness grief save us this self indulgent misery not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder those us who are sentient self aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness by way most human brains have fat controller who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything even keel even if that is sadness while rileys brain seems be lobotomised even before puberty has hit give this film wide berth fact it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before pestilence its carrying spreads,0.49300641886848784,0.13087401104642485,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Mandatory watch for children and parents alike.,"I did exactly what I was supposed to when watching this brilliant movie, I felt all the emotions at some point. Pixar did it again with Inside Out. For a long time I had stubbornly repeated that Toy Story would always be my favourite from Pixar, but I changed my mind shortly after watching this one. Like Toy Story you were offered a setup every adult can identify. Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them. The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection. I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it. I must admit that I cried a couple of times during the movie, because it has some really touching moments. You should be feeling all emotions when watching Inside Out. It is a must watch.",mandatory watch children parents alike,i did exactly what i was supposed when watching this brilliant movie i felt all emotions at some point pixar did it again with inside out long time i had stubbornly repeated that toy story would always be my favourite pixar but i changed my mind shortly after watching this one like toy story you were offered setup every adult can identify growing up learning how control your feelings learning importance every one them it is okay be angry sad happy afraid as long as we are taught how manage them idea having this control panel inside human body has been done before by osmosis jones 2001 but lets say with much less success inside out takes it highest level perfection i loved way pixar made this world inside main character riley it is very creatively done was some ways just how i had imagined it i must admit that i cried couple times during movie because it has some really touching moments you should be feeling all emotions when watching inside out it is must watch,0.5472222222222223,0.16666666666666666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,I feel like everybody has missed the point,"I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.",i feel like everybody has missed point,i am not normally one write reviews but i couldnt help reading several this film this site that just didt seem understand where i think film was supposed be coming majority complaints i saw were that film was too depressing childrens film but whilst i see where they are coming some regards every child who i have seen watch this film i work cinema has absolutely loved it laughed out loud almost constantly they are not old enough realise message film is trying convey that life isnt all about happiness i applaud attempt pixar make film that is not only hilarious places but is also major comment what life is like be younger teenager transitioning through one most important moments life more personal perspective why should everything we show our children gloss over reality life try make them believe everything is rosy 24 7 again what this film does brilliantly through message i took away at end was that life will never be 100 full happiness but that is fine why does it have be little bit sadness is necessary if person was never sad they would be inhumane overall then i suppose my review is more comment type film we exhibit children how nanny state we live looks protect them most lives inevitabilities either way what cant be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad equal parts what i am sure will become timeless classic years come,0.5453968253968254,0.17913419913419912,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
3.0,Emotions...what are you doing?,"INSIDE OUT is a colorful animated feature that I doubt if Disney and Pixar realize is probably too complex for the viewers they intend to reach. Riley(Kaitlyn Dias)is an 11 year old girl, who is really upset with her mom(Diane Lane)and dad's(Kyle MacLachlan)decision to uproot and move the family to San Francisco. Riley is separated from her friends and is just not so happy with dealing with a new house, school and city. She would rather be back in Minnesota playing hockey.Most of the film takes place inside Riley's young brain where she must deal with five emotions that dwell in Headquarters; there is Joy(Amy Poehler), Sadness(Phyllis Smith), Anger(Louis Black), Disgust(Mindy Kailing) and Fear(Bill Hader)that jostle to and fro trying to dominate control.

2.0,8.4 for shallow techno new age gibberish going nowhere?,"A young girl's five emotions try to solve her identity crisis caused by moving, but when the wrong levers in brain's control center are pushed, things go awry. That synopsis made me push watching this further and further ahead to, but I loved Docter's masterpiece ""Up"" so I had to watch this in a theater while I still could. Me and my partner thought, well, not really expecting much, so it will probably be OK. But oh what a disappointment it was. OK, I admit we are not teens. And love Japanese animation. And I do not appreciate Disney because of their marketing bonanza and ill-fitting gender stereotypes. But this film is so chock-full of fantasy-killing and misguided ideological messages that I am flabbergasted. It is beyond me how so little viewers find offense with the messages, and that these are thoroughly inappropriate for kids. Like for instance: 1) You are not in control of your emotions, your emotions control you. 2) Thought and reason have no influence at all on your decisions. 3) If you do not keep your emotions in check, you will lose your memories. If you lose your memories, you will become emotionally unresponsive. 4) There is only one good emotion (joy). There are four negative ones (sadness, anger, disgust, fear). That is it. That is what everyone feels. To hell with love. Or desire. Or curiosity. Or faith. 5) In order to grow up, your joyful memories have to become sad memories. Why? Good question. That is the climax of the movie and there is no explanation why this should be the case.None of this makes any sense. The whole plot is completely incoherent. These messages hold no educational value whatsoever. And strangely this seems to be more obvious to children than to adults - I heard a boy asking his parents what any of that was supposed to mean. This is obviously made and marketed for tech-savvy young parents who think they should take their kids to something more ""challenging"" than ""Planes 2"". The parents look like what an ad exec at Disney imagines Google employees to look like - mom wears cute specs, dad a hipster beard and it is set in San Francisco on top of that. The whole thing is probably the most in-your-face marketing device posing for a movie that I have ever seen. And everybody seems to be literally buying it.Well, not everybody. Some of the reviewers here do have similar issues, so all is not lost for the human race. If you care for an alternative story about a girl away from home struggling to adapt, there is the fantastic new Ghibli feature ""When Marnie was there"". That film has everything ""Inside Out"" has not: a story, believable characters, imagination, mystery, and most importantly: heart.",8 4 shallow techno new age gibberish going nowhere,young girls five emotions try solve her identity crisis caused by moving but when wrong levers brains control center are pushed things go awry that synopsis made me push watching this further further ahead but i loved docters masterpiece up so i had watch this theater while i still could me my partner thought well not really expecting much so it will probably be ok but oh what disappointment it was ok i admit we are not teens love japanese animation i do not appreciate disney because their marketing bonanza ill fitting gender stereotypes but this film is so chock full fantasy killing misguided ideological messages that i am flabbergasted it is beyond me how so little viewers find offense with messages that these are thoroughly inappropriate kids like instance 1 you are not control your emotions your emotions control you 2 thought reason have no influence at all your decisions 3 if you do not keep your emotions check you will lose your memories if you lose your memories you will become emotionally unresponsive 4 there is only one good emotion joy there are four negative ones sadness anger disgust fear that is it that is what everyone feels hell with love or desire or curiosity or faith 5 order grow up your joyful memories have become sad memories why good question that is climax movie there is no explanation why this should be case none this makes any sense whole plot is completely incoherent these messages hold no educational value whatsoever strangely this seems be more obvious children than adults i heard boy asking his parents what any that was supposed mean this is obviously made marketed tech savvy young parents who think they should take their kids something more challenging than planes 2 parents look like what ad exec at disney imagines google employees look like mom wears cute specs dad hipster beard it is set san francisco top that whole thing is probably most your face marketing device posing movie that i have ever seen everybody seems be literally buying it well not everybody some reviewers here do have similar issues so all is not lost human race if you care alternative story about girl away home struggling adapt there is fantastic new ghibli feature when marnie was there that film has everything inside out has not story believable characters imagination mystery most importantly heart,0.5132651515151514,0.14228787878787882,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 and one of their finest overall,"Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.Pixar films can be relied upon to have great animation, and Inside Out certainly does have great animation. No, wonderful animation and some of the company's most ingeniously inventive, with gorgeously vibrant colours, a very imaginatively rendered setting (and the lands even more ingeniously done, the next land more so than the last), very meticulous and beautifully modelled backgrounds and clever character designs that match the emotions more than ideally. Michael Giacchino's sparkling, rousing and very charming score is one of my personal favourite scores of the year so far, and every bit as great as his score for Up.A superb job was done with the script here too, the comedy is clever and witty without ever being forced and balances subtly with the drama, the drama is some of the most truly poignant of any Pixar film and it doesn't ever feel manipulative or overdone and it's very smartly insightful. The story, not one of THE most innovative concepts but is one of the more imaginative uses of it and is quite original for Pixar actually, goes at a slightly steadier pace than other Disney films, but still captivated. It was very easy to completely connect with Riley and her situation and this was easily the Pixar film since Toy Story 3 that I connected with emotionally the most, also one of Pixar's most moving stories quite easily.Loved the characters too, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Bing Bong (the imaginary friend and the 'epitome of immaturity', without ever being annoying, his back story did bring a tear to the eye) stole every scene they were in, and even Sadness managed to crack some funny one-liners even in her depressive state. Joy also positively lights up the screen and Riley was easy to connect with and much more than just a stereotypical teen girl. The voice acting is splendid. Amy Poehler is note perfect as Joy with her spirited banter giving the character so much life while also bringing a human element to her as well, Lewis Black gives an explosively barn-storming turn as Anger, Phyllis Smith is amusing and affecting, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are similarly priceless and in a way that makes the characters of Fear and Disgust endearing rather than annoying, Richard Kind is innocently charming and Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane are appropriately compassionate.Overall, a masterful return to form for Pixar.

3.0,Good enough,"Inside Out is the story of how emotions work in our minds (in a girl's mind to be precise). The emotions, Joy and Sadness, wonder around the girl's mind, aiming to find a way back to the controlling room where they can help her through a big change in her life. The story is interesting, but it gets boring towards the end, as the one twist follows the other. Joy is a control freak, dictating every emotions' move and pretty much dominating the girl's mood. Other than that, and the overjoy-full mood, Inside out is funny and entertaining. The colours are vivid and the action enough to make a good movie. But I guess the whole control room, memories, dreams etc etc are kind of confusing, with all the islands and the maze.

10.0,Everyone that rated this below a 7 are why can't have nice things.,"Oh my god. This has to be the most misunderstood Pixar film ever created. I never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now, but, reading through the reviews, it just isn't justified. All of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children, but, this film isn't for them. I found that it reached out to a completely new audience, one that Pixar hasn't really touched upon recently, and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression. I am now 14 years old, and this film came out at just the right time for me, when things were taking a turn for the worst. I was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that I don't want to talk about, around the time in which this film was released. I hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time, and my little sister really wanted to see this one. Looking at all the generally positive feedback, I decided to go see it with her. The opening sequence was possibly one of the best Pixar had done since Wall-E. It was beautiful and cinematic, and just adorable. Riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint. As the film moved on, I started to realize how well this film related to my life, and how well riley related to me as a character. Pixar was very subtle with it, but, managed to develop Riley's character so well, with her barely being on screen. The characters themselves were shockingly complex, especially sadness and joy. (Joy has a brilliant character design, with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.) The main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home, away from her friends, her hockey team. Depression, in my experience, isnt what it says it is. To me, it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. When joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile, this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. Joy and sadness are the two most important emotions, and riley didnt have them anymore. A complete lack of emotion, a state of depression. The rest of the film after that was enjoyable, and a certain character whom I was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'Frozen', turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. Everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. I had one. It helped me cope with stress, I talked to it when I was mad about something, and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason, she was always there. That's why Bing Bong's death was just so hard to watch, because of how painfully true it is. I guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. The thing is, he didnt die, he was completely forgotten. When you think about it, it seems so much worse than dying. After that, joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. He isnt mentioned ever again in the movie, but, I'm kinda okay with that. If the movie forgets about him, the audience does as well, which creates an illusion. Now, let's talk about the ending. When riley returns home to her worried parents, she seems emotionless. Then I realized something, a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film. True happiness cannot exist without sadness. This realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever, mixed emotions. As riley is growing up and maturing, mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. This symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up. This film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have matured just like riley did in the film. Pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions, personalities, and maturity. I love this film so much, and it changed my life.",everyone that rated this below 7 are why cant have nice things,oh my god this has be most misunderstood pixar film ever created i never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now but reading through reviews it just isnt justified all these are parents complaining about it being too intense young children but this film isnt them i found that it reached out completely new audience one that pixar hasnt really touched upon recently that is pre teens teenagers that suffer depression i am now 14 years old this film came out at just right time me when things were taking turn worst i was going through depression suicidal thoughts reasons that i dont want talk about around time which this film was released i hadnt seen disney film quite long time my little sister really wanted see this one looking at all generally positive feedback i decided go see it with her opening sequence was possibly one best pixar had done since wall e it was beautiful cinematic just adorable riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions detailing animation standpoint as film moved i started realize how well this film related my life how well riley related me as character pixar was very subtle with it but managed develop rileys character so well with her barely being screen characters themselves were shockingly complex especially sadness joy joy has brilliant character design with blue eyes blue hair which well get later main plot basically revolves around pre teen going into state depression after moving her new home away her friends her hockey team depression my experience isnt what it says it is me it is complete lack any feeling whatsoever when joy sadness basically lose control riley awhile this perfectly captured what is going inside their head meaning at beginning film joy sadness are two most important emotions riley didnt have them anymore complete lack emotion state depression rest film after that was enjoyable certain character whom i was almost sure going be twist villain after that monstrosity that was frozen turned out be my personal favorite character film everyones had some sort imaginative personality growing up i had one it helped me cope with stress i talked it when i was mad about something whenever no one seemed want talk me whatever reason she was always there thats why bing bongs death was just so hard watch because how painfully true it is i guarantee that 99 people earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up thing is he didnt die he was completely forgotten when you think about it it seems so much worse than dying after that joy seems have forgotten about him as well he isnt mentioned ever again movie but im kinda okay with that if movie forgets about him audience does as well which creates illusion now lets talk about ending when riley returns home her worried parents she seems emotionless then i realized something slow realization that happened throughout final scene film true happiness cannot exist without sadness this realization is depicted one most brilliant forms ever mixed emotions as riley is growing up maturing mixed emotions become apart her her core memories this symbolizes maturity complexity as you grow up this film got me open up my parents about my depression anxiety i feel like i have matured just like riley did film pixar did brilliant job as depicting our emotions personalities maturity i love this film so much it changed my life,0.5345969479531123,0.23601598173515978,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,A brilliant depiction of adolescence,"As an adult, I love animated films but the trailers made this one look like it was really just for kids. I gave it a shot anyway and I didn't expect to love it--but it's depth absolutely shocked me. Not only is it a whimsical, funny film, but the poetry is off the charts.The creators of this film truly remember what it was like to be a child and continue to express understanding to children's feelings today. Riley is a light hearted little girl on the cusp of adolescence, approaching that turbulent age where everything changes and it seems like there is no one there to help you.Riley's emotions are portrayed using colorful creatures inside her head. Joy has been the ringleader of the emotions up until now, but Riley's life changes are starting to shake things up and Sadness has begun to take over. Truly amazing how this was depicted! Absolutely brilliant.As a kid, adults are often dismissing your emotions and never listening to you when you need them most. Often times kids cannot express themselves and turn to anger, panic or disgust, all emotions that will only heighten your problems as Riley comes to learn.When Joy finally lets Sadness take the reins and Riley opens up to her parents and they actually LISTEN to her...it is breathtaking.Don't miss out on this movie, definitely a must see!

1.0,"I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, let alone children","The trailer was so misleading. It portrayed the film as funny, but this film is anything but. It starts off where 11 year old Riley moves from Minnesota to California which she is unhappy about. She gets to the gloomy grey house in a gloomy grey street and you feel her depression and disappointment. It was California but there was no sunshine to speak of. You wouldn't expect this kind of bleakness in a film aimed at young people let alone children. The film barely gave Riley any screen time and spent most of the time on emotions Joy and Sadness, who were both trapped outside brain headquarters and trying to get back. Sadness has to be the most annoying, unlike-able character. On the way they meet Bing Bong, Riley's old imaginary elephant friend. Seeing him cry because he's sad Riley no longer plays with him made me cry, but it gets worse, when he and Joy get trapped in a dump and both try to escape, they can't get out together because he's to heavy,so he let's her go alone, she looks back to see him disappearing into thin air while saying ""take Riley to the moon for me"". This was a Bambi sad moment. We never get reunited with Bing Bong and never see or hear from him again, this is such a downer, he was innocent,helpful and likable.There was one scene where Riley introduces herself to her new classmates and then bursts into tears because she didn't want to be there, I couldn't help but think this was an overreaction. Since Joy and Sadness were no longer in her mind she's only left with Disgust,Anger and Fear (these characters had nowhere near enough screen time and were much more entertaining than Joy and Sadness). She decides to steal money from her mother and run away back to Minnesota, but as soon as she's on the bus, Sadness and Joy have made it back to headquarters and Joy orders Sadness to do her work. Riley suddenly feels sadness and realising she'll miss her family changes her mind and runs back home. As soon as she sees her parents she starts crying and says she doesn't like living here. Her parents comfort her and the film ends there.So the moral of the story is its okay to cry and that all our emotions are important,even the bad ones. If Riley didn't feel sadness she would have never seen sense and went ahead with her stupid plan and probably end up being raped and murdered.Once the film is over you don't feel happy, nothing good really happened it was just wall to wall misery. Bing Bongs death, Riley being isolated from her parents, ditching her hobbies, losing her two important emotions, losing her old friends, hating her new house, eating lunch alone at her new school and running away. This is a Disney film right? Talk about putting bad ideas in children heads. After the film was over I felt sad for the rest of the day and night. I wish I never watched this.",i wouldnt recommend this film anyone let alone children,trailer was so misleading it portrayed film as funny but this film is anything but it starts off where 11 year old riley moves minnesota california which she is unhappy about she gets gloomy grey house gloomy grey street you feel her depression disappointment it was california but there was no sunshine speak you wouldnt expect this kind bleakness film aimed at young people let alone children film barely gave riley any screen time spent most time emotions joy sadness who were both trapped outside brain headquarters trying get back sadness has be most annoying unlike able character way they meet bing bong rileys old imaginary elephant friend seeing him cry because hes sad riley no longer plays with him made me cry but it gets worse when he joy get trapped dump both try escape they cant get out together because hes heavy so he lets her go alone she looks back see him disappearing into thin air while saying take riley moon me this was bambi sad moment we never get reunited with bing bong never see or hear him again this is such downer he was innocent helpful likable there was one scene where riley introduces herself her new classmates then bursts into tears because she didnt want be there i couldnt help but think this was overreaction since joy sadness were no longer her mind shes only left with disgust anger fear these characters had nowhere near enough screen time were much more entertaining than joy sadness she decides steal money her mother run away back minnesota but as soon as shes bus sadness joy have made it back headquarters joy orders sadness do her work riley suddenly feels sadness realising shell miss her family changes her mind runs back home as soon as she sees her parents she starts crying says she doesnt like living here her parents comfort her film ends there so moral story is its okay cry that all our emotions are important even bad ones if riley didnt feel sadness she would have never seen sense went ahead with her stupid plan probably end up being raped murdered once film is over you dont feel happy nothing good really happened it was just wall wall misery bing bongs death riley being isolated her parents ditching her hobbies losing her two important emotions losing her old friends hating her new house eating lunch alone at her new school running away this is disney film right talk about putting bad ideas children heads after film was over i felt sad rest day night i wish i never watched this,0.45496264488199967,0.08378718056137412,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.5, 'Fear': 0.23}"
6.0,An Interesting Concept with a Handful of Inconsistencies,"Inside Out is the hit Disney-Pixar animated movie about emotions, specifically emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat human form and controlling how people react to things. It's an interesting concept, and for the most part it's presented well, but there are flaws for sure. The plot is, like I already said, interesting but flawed. It bothers me that people are saying that this is an incredibly original concept despite the fact that it's been done before. It's just the most popular use of the idea, but it's not the original. The story itself, however, has a handful of really good ideas, but there are inconsistencies with it too. The disappointing part is that most of the inconsistencies are actually pointless scenes that don't add to the story but instead end up taking away from it. There aren't a lot of them, but there's enough to take away from the movie itself. Most of the inconsistencies would spoil the movie, so you'll just have to watch it to understand. Other than that the ideas are good and some are even pretty amusing. The characters are okay. I found the most interesting characters to be the parents personally, with Riley being as flat as a pancake and everyone else just not being important enough to even remember by the time the credits roll. For a movie about emotion, Riley really isn't presented in a very realistic way. Sure, at times she's good, but most of the time her character is just inconsistent. The parents were, on the other hand, much more consistent, and funnier most of the time. I think that this movie had a great beginning and a great ending, it was just the middle stuff that struggled. It's a very emotionally intense movie, especially towards the end. I felt much more into the movie at these points, and even on my third watch I got a bit emotional about the ending. The movie felt a little too short as well, but maybe that's because I've seen it so many times already. Overall Inside Out is just good. I think that I loved it so much originally (I gave it a 10/10) because of the ending. It was pretty emotional the first time, but after the second watch I started to question it. By the third watch I found inconsistencies and a handful of things that I just didn't like about the movie. Ideas and such that just weren't nearly as good as I remember. In the end I'd still certainly recommend this movie, but if you want to really love it then don't analyze it, because otherwise you'll notice the things that I did (probably).",interesting concept with handful inconsistencies,inside out is hit disney pixar animated movie about emotions specifically emotions living inside persons brain somewhat human form controlling how people react things its interesting concept most part its presented well but there are flaws sure plot is like i already said interesting but flawed it bothers me that people are saying that this is incredibly original concept despite fact that its been done before its just most popular use idea but its not original story itself however has handful really good ideas but there are inconsistencies with it too disappointing part is that most inconsistencies are actually pointless scenes that dont add story but instead end up taking away it there arent lot them but theres enough take away movie itself most inconsistencies would spoil movie so youll just have watch it understand other than that ideas are good some are even pretty amusing characters are okay i found most interesting characters be parents personally with riley being as flat as pancake everyone else just not being important enough even remember by time credits roll movie about emotion riley really isnt presented very realistic way sure at times shes good but most time her character is just inconsistent parents were other hand much more consistent funnier most time i think that this movie had great beginning great ending it was just middle stuff that struggled its very emotionally intense movie especially towards end i felt much more into movie at these points even my third watch i got bit emotional about ending movie felt little too short as well but maybe thats because ive seen it so many times already overall inside out is just good i think that i loved it so much originally i gave it 10 10 because ending it was pretty emotional first time but after second watch i started question it by third watch i found inconsistencies handful things that i just didnt like about movie ideas such that just werent nearly as good as i remember end id still certainly recommend this movie but if you want really love it then dont analyze it because otherwise youll notice things that i did probably,0.4953162578162578,0.24971139971139972,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.25}"

,The Older You Are the More You'll Like It,"Inside Out (2015) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Eleven-year-old Riley has a wonderfully fun childhood thanks to the emotions working inside of her. Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) all help keep the young girl moving forward but when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransisco it throws everyone for a loop and soon Joy and Sadness find themselves lost in her system and trying to find their way back.INSIDE OUT is certainly another winner from Pixar who are clearly the experts of the family movie. What really amazes me about the studio is that they're actually just making adult movies that kids happen to enjoy because of the pretty characters on the screen. I say this because films like this one, UP and WALL-E really do have adult stories dealing with adult issues yet somehow the studios are able to keep kids entertained while their parents get a lot more of the jokes and the emotions that the story provides. This one here is an incredibly touching story from a parent's point of view simply because of the changes that their kids go through.There's no doubt that the animation is the star of this picture and we're really treated to some wonderful images. I especially loved the use of colors in the picture and how various colors had a certain emotion attached to it. This is certainly excellent once our adventure begins as there's a ""long term memory"" section where these wonderful color marble like things are collection. Just the site of this are a true treat for the eyes. All of the ""emotion"" characters are perfectly brought to life with both Joy and Anger really standing out. The human characters are also quite entertaining and there's no doubt that the Bing Bong character will go down as a favorite decades from now.As I said, this film is going to work a lot better for older kids and adults as I'm sure the majority of young children aren't fully going to grasp the idea of emotions and how they effect our lives. The story itself is quite charming throughout and I was surprised at how many adult issues they were able to work on throughout the running time.

5.0,Doctor's only real misfire. It is so fundamentally confused,"This film is very frustrating because it is so close to being a wonderful experience that ranks among the very best Pixar. But the concept is just not suited to a longer narrative film-especially one that is intended to be a bittersweet comedy. The emotion-people are driving around us people-people is a funny, striking concept. The film flashes brilliance repeatedly by using this concept logically. Lewis Black as Anger is some of the best casting of all time. But alas the film doesn't work. I believe the following three conceptual problems are what do the film in.First Riley is not a real character in the film because Riley is not the seat of consciousness-Joy is. (This is true for all human ""characters"" and their dominate emotions.) This means that the story of Riley adjusting to moving to San Francisco rings entirely hollow because Riley is a mere automaton. She feels *nothing* only her emotion-people do. (The film's conception of how emotions work is *really* hard to work out the details.)Second, Joy and the other emotion-people are basically stuck in whatever emotion they are or cause. I.e. Joy is joyful, Fear is fearful, etc. This ends up causing two problems: the characters can be annoying because conceptually they are stuck in a single mode. Joy-being the main character-suffers the most from this. She is too chirper and it is grating. People might differ on this and find say Sadness too morose. Second, the emotion-people should not be able to feel emotions besides they one they are. Joy is Joyful and she should be unable to feel anything else at all.This brings me to the third conceptual problem. The film cheats on the last point and allows the emotion-people to have emotions besides the one they are. Joy for example *feels* sadness. This is because drama requires characters to change through time-this is why I think the concept is better suited to a short. However, this utterly undermines the explanation of where emotions come from that is the basis of the film. Either Joy herself has five emotions in *her* head to control *her* emotions or the emotion-people feel emotions as brute fact. In either case it does not work as an explanation; you either get an infinite regressions (it's emotions in heads all the down!) or there is no explanation for the emotion-people emotions beyond brute fact but in that case why no simply say humans feel as brute fact?The last point might seem like I am taking the film too literally. Perhaps I am but even as metaphor I find the conceptual problems to much to stomach. I simply cannot suspend my disbelief and go with the film. It is more perplexing and ill-considered the more you look at it.",doctors only real misfire it is so fundamentally confused,this film is very frustrating because it is so close being wonderful experience that ranks among very best pixar but concept is just not suited longer narrative film especially one that is intended be bittersweet comedy emotion people are driving around us people people is funny striking concept film flashes brilliance repeatedly by using this concept logically lewis black as anger is some best casting all time but alas film doesnt work i believe following three conceptual problems are what do film first riley is not real character film because riley is not seat consciousness joy is this is true all human characters their dominate emotions this means that story riley adjusting moving san francisco rings entirely hollow because riley is mere automaton she feels nothing only her emotion people do films conception how emotions work is really hard work out details second joy other emotion people are basically stuck whatever emotion they are or cause i e joy is joyful fear is fearful etc this ends up causing two problems characters can be annoying because conceptually they are stuck single mode joy being main character suffers most this she is too chirper it is grating people might differ this find say sadness too morose second emotion people should not be able feel emotions besides they one they are joy is joyful she should be unable feel anything else at all this brings me third conceptual problem film cheats last point allows emotion people have emotions besides one they are joy example feels sadness this is because drama requires characters change through time this is why i think concept is better suited short however this utterly undermines explanation where emotions come that is basis film either joy herself has five emotions her head control her emotions or emotion people feel emotions as brute fact either case it does not work as explanation you either get infinite regressions its emotions heads all down or there is no explanation emotion people emotions beyond brute fact but that case why no simply say humans feel as brute fact last point might seem like i am taking film too literally perhaps i am but even as metaphor i find conceptual problems much stomach i simply cannot suspend my disbelief go with film it is more perplexing ill considered more you look at it,0.459860376249265,0.10993239271017047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9.0,9/10,"94 minutes of pure joy and emotion. A return to masterclass from pixar and not only that, probably their best work outside of Toy Story 1 and 2. This film does deserves every bit of praise it has got and more. I will say without hesitation that if you haven't seen this film, believe me you should.Lets just start easy by saying that the animation is something other-wordily. We are beyond the point where anyone needs to express the fact that pixar's animation is gorgeous, but the fact is this animation is some of the most intelligent and dense animation I have ever seen. There are easter eggs in every single frame and more than that every visual element in the movie is well rounded and clearly thought out which makes the storytelling so much more gripping. Talking about storytelling, rarely does a film do visual storytelling so brilliantly. Five minutes into the movie I was in and I knew how things were rolling. This s really a lesson on how to think things out visually and how to use visuals to your advantage as much as it is possible, combining them to smart, engaging ideas.And now to the layers the film has. The deepness of its themes, the intelligence of its story, the subtext behind every action and word, the comedic touches, the insanely funny pop culture references, the poetic approach to joy and sadness, the emotional depth, everything, I'm telling you everything here is gut wrenching. There isn't one scene where you feel time is being wasted, there isn't one word a character speaks that doesn't feel genuine, there isn't one idea that is boring or unoriginal. This film is beyond emotionally engaging, this film gives you a mirror on which to reflect your life and think about it, but no wait it doesn't stop there, it also gives you the opportunity to laugh about it, that no matter what is going on there is also space for a laugh and for lightness. Wow.After a second viewing I have settled on the problem I originally had and can now honestly say this film really just has nitpick issues, it's truly a great one and definitely the best we've been given in 2015 so far. After my first viewing I was all enthusiastic about everything above, but I also was left a little confused by the mythology the film uses and wasn't quite sure it always fit. Upon a second viewing I guarantee that there is no such problem. The mythology is perfect and works with a solid and thought out logic that takes into account the chaos of life. What doesn't quite work is the fact that the film does have a few really minor shortcuts or conveniences that may stick out and I honestly wanted a little bit more of the control center room scenes and see some more of how it worked there, but then again I am really nitpicking.Incredible for me to say it, but I really want a sequel to this film, it's incredible. I want to see another two hours of the five emotions battling in out in the life of Riley and her further struggles, especially want to see the teenage years. This idea is truly amazing and special and it is so inspiring to me, I just really want a sequel to this film and that's the first time I've ever said that in my life.Trust me this film deserves every single bit of your attention and heart, it will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions and entertainment that is absolutely delightful and will also leave you thinking for days.",9 10,94 minutes pure joy emotion return masterclass pixar not only that probably their best work outside toy story 1 2 this film does deserves every bit praise it has got more i will say without hesitation that if you havent seen this film believe me you should lets just start easy by saying that animation is something other wordily we are beyond point where anyone needs express fact that pixars animation is gorgeous but fact is this animation is some most intelligent dense animation i have ever seen there are easter eggs every single frame more than that every visual element movie is well rounded clearly thought out which makes storytelling so much more gripping talking about storytelling rarely does film do visual storytelling so brilliantly five minutes into movie i was i knew how things were rolling this s really lesson how think things out visually how use visuals your advantage as much as it is possible combining them smart engaging ideas now layers film has deepness its themes intelligence its story subtext behind every action word comedic touches insanely funny pop culture references poetic approach joy sadness emotional depth everything im telling you everything here is gut wrenching there isnt one scene where you feel time is being wasted there isnt one word character speaks that doesnt feel genuine there isnt one idea that is boring or unoriginal this film is beyond emotionally engaging this film gives you mirror which reflect your life think about it but no wait it doesnt stop there it also gives you opportunity laugh about it that no matter what is going there is also space laugh lightness wow after second viewing i have settled problem i originally had can now honestly say this film really just has nitpick issues its truly great one definitely best weve been given 2015 so far after my first viewing i was all enthusiastic about everything above but i also was left little confused by mythology film uses wasnt quite sure it always fit upon second viewing i guarantee that there is no such problem mythology is perfect works with solid thought out logic that takes into account chaos life what doesnt quite work is fact that film does have few really minor shortcuts or conveniences that may stick out i honestly wanted little bit more control center room scenes see some more how it worked there but then again i am really nitpicking incredible me say it but i really want sequel this film its incredible i want see another two hours five emotions battling out life riley her further struggles especially want see teenage years this idea is truly amazing special it is so inspiring me i just really want sequel this film thats first time ive ever said that my life trust me this film deserves every single bit your attention heart it will take you roller coaster emotions entertainment that is absolutely delightful will also leave you thinking days,0.5068364476592325,0.26488848704038576,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
