1.0,This Movie fails...on so many levels.,"No matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful.If you view it as a horror, then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets.If you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame.If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a B**ch!If you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero.As you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining. As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie. This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre. Critters looked pretty good, so did the Ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these. The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable. The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid. I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum (which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21.

2.0,A Rip-off of Rip-offs,"If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins, then Hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like Ghoulies. These barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams - oh joy), but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess, except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica.

2.0,Truly a cinematic milestone.,"So there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's KEVIN, the world's biggest wuss. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, bratty, and virginal girlfriend AMY. As he returns from work to... a random house... he finds his ""friends,"" the sexually confusing red-shorted KYLE and the truly revolting sluttish DAPHNE. They are soon joined by Daphne's boyfriend, the trigger-happy sex-crazed macho lunkhead NICK. And there's the title creatures, horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire. Kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy, yucky woman in spandex. Nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria-- I mean nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne's already a disgusting slut, so she doesn't have a heart's desire. Along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song.

,"Not only fails on every level, it invents new levels to fail on!","There is a bizarre reverse synergy at work in ""Hobgoblins"". I've seen movies with poorer acting (""EEGAH!"" and any number of Italian rip offs of American hits), worse writing (""Castle of Fu Manchu""), more pathetic sets and effects (""Future War""), and more repellent performers (""Teenagers Battle the Thing""). I've seen movies which were more badly conceived and executed (""Deafula""). But ""Hobgoblins"" is something truly special in the Annals of Suck.Watching this movie, I kept rubbing my eyes and smacking myself on the side of the head, thinking that maybe something was wrong with my optic nerves or focal lenses and if I could only get them jarred back into place, ""Hobgoblins"" might resolve into something made by human beings. Alas, this turned out not to be the case. Everything up there on the screen is there on purpose, and rarely have people collaborated to make something so completely wrongheaded and goofy.The kids who play the leads have no frigging idea of what they are doing on camera. None. Zip, zilch, nada. (On the positive side, they seems to know their lines, and there isn't too much obvious reading from teleprompter and cue cards.) I hate to trash them too badly, because it was someone else's decision to cast them in the first place, and the director apparently had an attitude of ""I just point the camera and let it roll"". I'll be generous, and rate their performances slightly above those of the wives of Manos during the nightgown wrestling scenes in ""Manos: The Hands Of Fate"".I've seen better monster SFX in home movies filmed by ambitious 8th graders. There are several scenes where the camera is pointed straight at one or more monsters, with nothing to disguise or soften the view, and they are so obviously stuffed puppets being shaken or held against the actors by someone's hand (just off camera), that your job drops beholding the sheer incompetence of it. Seriously, low budget soft core porn movies do a better job with their effects, and no one expects those films to even try in the first place.The script throws in every cliché you can think of: weenie kid discovers his inner hero and becomes a man and gets the girl, shy girl has an inner slut just dying to come out, army jock is a bully, and later becomes a killing machine, old caretaker hides a dangerous secret, magical creatures doom you by granting your fondest wish, underground dance club is the scene for danger and adventure... The plot staggers drunkenly from one story element to the next, slobbers on a given theme for a few seconds and then goes on to another theme and slobbers on that one for a bit. Not one scene, not a single story thread, is ever dealt with in a convincing (or even entertaining) matter, and in the end all the viewer is left with is some vague memories of stuffed puppets and shrill trollops who resemble Lorraine Newman and a geek who whines a lot.The first 2/3rds of the film is deliriously bad. But the inanity ramps up to unspeakable levels once the story moves to ""Club Scum"". This increases the number of people who don't know what they are doing in a scene from 4-5 to dozens, and the results are too appalling to describe in a family-oriented web site. I especially hated the bouncer character and the MC/announcer - they camp it up outrageously, and the viewer wishes a horrible death upon them as punishment for their sins. And the so-called band performs a song during all this (""Pig-Sticker""?? ""Sh*t Kicker""?? ""Pit Licker""?? ""Sick Liquor""??) that qualifies as the least believable music performance in a film since the concert scene in ""Howard the Duck"".You have to see this film to believe such a thing exists. I rank it as one of the most idiotic and goofy film experiences ever, and I've seen ""Deafula"" and ""The Magic Land of Mother Goose"".",not only fails every level it invents new levels fail,there is bizarre reverse synergy at work hobgoblins ive seen movies with poorer acting eegah any number italian rip offs american hits worse writing castle fu manchu more pathetic sets effects future war more repellent performers teenagers battle thing ive seen movies which were more badly conceived executed deafula but hobgoblins is something truly special annals suck watching this movie i kept rubbing my eyes smacking myself side head thinking that maybe something was wrong with my optic nerves or focal lenses if i could only get them jarred back into place hobgoblins might resolve into something made by human beings alas this turned out not be case everything up there screen is there purpose rarely have people collaborated make something so completely wrongheaded goofy kids who play leads have no frigging idea what they are doing camera none zip zilch nada positive side they seems know their lines there isnt too much obvious reading teleprompter cue cards i hate trash them too badly because it was someone elses decision cast them first place director apparently had attitude i just point camera let it roll ill be generous rate their performances slightly above those wives manos during nightgown wrestling scenes manos hands fate ive seen better monster sfx home movies filmed by ambitious 8th graders there are several scenes where camera is pointed straight at one or more monsters with nothing disguise or soften view they are so obviously stuffed puppets being shaken or held against actors by someones hand just off camera that your job drops beholding sheer incompetence it seriously low budget soft core porn movies do better job with their effects no one expects those films even try first place script throws every clich you can think weenie kid discovers his inner hero becomes man gets girl shy girl has inner slut just dying come out army jock is bully later becomes killing machine old caretaker hides dangerous secret magical creatures doom you by granting your fondest wish underground dance club is scene danger adventure plot staggers drunkenly one story element next slobbers given theme few seconds then goes another theme slobbers that one bit not one scene not single story thread is ever dealt with convincing or even entertaining matter end all viewer is left with is some vague memories stuffed puppets shrill trollops who resemble lorraine newman geek who whines lot first 2 3rds film is deliriously bad but inanity ramps up unspeakable levels once story moves club scum this increases number people who dont know what they are doing scene 4 5 dozens results are too appalling describe family oriented web site i especially hated bouncer character mc announcer they camp it up outrageously viewer wishes horrible death upon them as punishment their sins so called band performs song during all this pig sticker sh t kicker pit licker sick liquor that qualifies as least believable music performance film since concert scene howard duck you have see this film believe such thing exists i rank it as one most idiotic goofy film experiences ever ive seen deafula magic land mother goose,0.5425595238095238,-0.08321656413761676,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,"Call the Fashion Police, there's a crime in progress!","There can be no questions of spoilers for this movie, the director beat us all too and spoiled this movie in oh so many ways.A blatant rip-off of stuff like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails on so many levels to recapture the humour and horror of those better made films. It ends up a sleazy waste of time, where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director, who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them. They wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening. It's painful to watch, and not helped by the mental 80's fashions worn by the cast.Basically, some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement, and begin to telepathically screw around with peoples minds. The guards new recruit, the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings, gets his gang of 80's friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to recapture the Grem... Hobgoblins.All life is here, with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock, his 80's slut girlfriend, the 'hero's frigid and prissy girlfriend, and the young hero, lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway.First off comes the infamous rake fighting scene, where the ex-military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully, poking the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours. Then there's some running around, terminating in a real pie-fight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand-grenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them. Then the film sorta ends, and alls well that ends well.It's not. This is like watching a train wreck, you cant take your eyes off it, it's so bad. Perfect fare for Mystery Science Theater, but god-awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut. The Fashion Police still have a number of outstanding warrants for the cast, and I dare anyone not to laugh in outright derision at the rake fight. This scores 2 out of 10 at most, on a good day.",call fashion police theres crime progress,there can be no questions spoilers this movie director beat us all too spoiled this movie oh so many ways blatant rip off stuff like critters gremlins this movie fails so many levels recapture humour horror those better made films it ends up sleazy waste time where bad actors deliver bad dialogue front idiot director who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them they wrestle with said toys much same manner as old tarzan films used use rubber crocodiles shaking them whilst screaming trying their best make it look slightly threatening its painful watch not helped by mental 80s fashions worn by cast basically some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by aging security guard film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement begin telepathically screw around with peoples minds guards new recruit idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings gets his gang 80s friends together they go off have minor adventures together while trying recapture grem hobgoblins all life is here with gang consisting knucklehead jock his 80s slut girlfriend heros frigid prissy girlfriend young hero lacking confidence wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway first off comes infamous rake fighting scene where ex military jock shows how he was trained army be bully poking nerdy hero with wrong end rake what seems like hours then theres some running around terminating real pie fight style ending scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand grenades blowing up everything except people standing right next them then film sorta ends alls well that ends well its not this is like watching train wreck you cant take your eyes off it its so bad perfect fare mystery science theater but god awful should you try watch it alone uncut fashion police still have number outstanding warrants cast i dare anyone not laugh outright derision at rake fight this scores 2 out 10 at most good day,0.5146490414347559,-0.09957354153782726,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Desperately unfunny,"After Gremlins hit box office gold it must have seemed like a really good idea to rip it off. Unfortunately Hobgoblins lacks some of the key ingredients of Gremlins, notably the likable characters, plot, credibility and effects, and Gremlins was quite funny in places whereas Hobgoblins just isn't.In fiction good writers try hard to make you like the main character, that's how fiction has worked ever since some Greek guy put a mask on and pretended to be someone else. So what character have you got to bond with in Hobgoblins? How about a whiny henpecked little weasel in a dead end job with a totally frigid girlfriend and a bunch of friends that are more irritating than having Vanessa Feltz sewn into your face? His friends include a rake-fighting military tough guy, some weedy gay guy in red shorts and a girl so sexual that the mere sound of her boyfriends car horn causes her to lift her skirt up in anticipation.The film has one good idea, basically these hobgoblins can bring your every fantasy to life. Sadly this good idea is squandered by the actors sheer inability to act as well as plenty of scenes where they hug plush toys to themselves and try to act scared. There's not much logic to it either, the hobgoblins are supposedly locked safely away in a vault with a cage around it. But when we see it neither are even shut. How much effort would it have taken to shout at a stage hand to close them? Too much for this movie unfortunately.I couldn't escape the feeling that the people responsible for this film put in the very least effort they thought they could get away with.

1.0,Cinemantastic Disasterpiece,"Usually a review starts with a small synopsis of the film. This is difficult when the director, Rick Sloane, forgets what film he was making half-way through and only gives enough of a damn to hand his camera over to his eight-year-old imagination. *Spoiler* Rick was molested as an eight-year-old.This movie starts off in an abandoned movie lot (sigh) where the protagonist, Kevin, starts his new job as an undoubtedly small- genitalled night-watch man. The old-hat night-watch mentor guy tells Kevin that he can't open the vault for no particular reason. At some point, the vault gets opened and the hobgoblins escape. The hobgoblins are capable of making people's wishes come true and funnily enough *spoiler* every character's deepest wish costs less than twenty-dollars and never involves naked boobs. According to the old guy, they have to get the hobgoblins back into the vault before dawn or else – you guessed it – something. We never find out what 'something' is, but it's only mentioned about twice before the script runs out and the cast improvises the rest of the film. There's a rake-fight in there somewhere and something to do with a nunchuk bikie fight(ish) so that Kevin can impress his hag girlfriend.

2.0,"Things I learned watching ""Hobgoblins""","1. Aliens resemble plush toys and hand puppets, while having arms that don't function.2. Aliens mastered intergalactic space travel, but they don't know how to push an unlocked vault door open, yet can push open a door being held shut by five people.3. Old Security Guards know how to get a hold of C4, and are just waiting for the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly fired for no explainable reason.4. Apparently, US Army boot camp, in the 80's, involved several sessions of ""garden tool combat"", including the pirouette spin of death.5. To impress your prudish girl friend, you have to ""save the world...err...neighborhood"" from aliens.6. All women are sluts, either openly or secretly.7. Scummy night clubs look like bad diners.8. ""Scummy"" waitresses double as dancers for The Fontanelles (how did they get talked into this?) who can only do bad 60's dance moves.9. Army privates secretly dream of being Rambo.10. Grenades apparently have a setting for ""flash-bang"". 11. Being burned alive apparently only leaves one with minor burns on their arms.12. US Army Staff Sargeants apparently happen to always be in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area.13. Aliens apparently always ""go home"", which means back to the vault they were un-locked in.14. Aliens are attracted to bright lights, which apparently means in the Los Angeles area one would assume, the protagonist's house is the most brightly lit thing in the area.15.

1.0,"Big hair, spandex, ""Hobgoblins"" - 3 bad things about the '80s!","For starters, ""Hobgoblins"" tries to ape the more successful ""Gremlins"".

HOBGOBLINS is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.The story is stupid, so I won't go into much detail. I don't really remember many of the characters anyway. A loser named Kevin (Tom Bartlett) is trying to make his annoying and non-supportive girlfriend proud of him, so he takes a job as a security guard and unleashes a band of stupid-looking puppets called Hobgoblins, who kill people by giving them what they really want. The way this leads to people getting killed is very idiotic. The hobgoblins go on a rampage which results in one guy getting hurt a little and a car getting destroyed. The ending is also stupid and not worth bringing up.The acting is the worst I have ever seen. None of the actors went anywhere after this movie, nor did any of them deserve to. The special effects, if you can really call them that, were unforgivable. The hobgoblins themselves are the most fake looking puppets I have ever seen.Unless in MST3K, this movie should be avoided at all costs.

It realizes it's garbage and makes no apologies--a bad movie that never tries to be anything more! The film is about an old movie studio that's no longer functioning. When young guys are given jobs here as security guards, they have a habit of dying--and the old guy working with them doesn't do a whole lot to stop this until our hero (i.e., a big wuss) saves the old guy and the oldster tells him about the hobgoblins that live there. These creatures grant people whatever wish they want but end up killing them in the process. A not particularly good deal if you ask me. When these things get loose and attack the neighborhood, it's time to destroy these malevolent pests.The film is an obvious knock-off of GREMLINS, though with practically no budget and actors who are ALL worse than Zack Galligan!!! But the most hilariously bad part of the film are the hobgoblins which are nothing more than cheap puppets--not much more realistic than ones kids might get from Toys R Us!

2.0,"A waste of money, time and resources","Whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the MST3K version, you can only be impressed by the utter GALL that went into this production. The filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so.Everything about it is rock-bottom cheap. Even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard.The ""hobgoblins"" are, as you probably know, ""realized"" with badly-crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them, it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body. When the critters scurry away from the two security guards, this is shown (or rather, not shown) by the camera aiming UP at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past. It's reminiscent of the scene in the film ""Tangents"" where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world, surveying the wreckage, and we aren't shown any of it. Budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing, so why try? The ""sets"" were utterly laughable. ""Club Scum"" was an obvious diner; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot. The ""spacecraft"" is something I would have been ashamed to build when I was a model-making 10 year-old.The motivations of the characters make no sense-- Kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her ""proud of him."" I'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go to hell and left her. Nick is supposedly back from 2 months of Army training (yeah, nice regulation haircut, Nick,) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a phone-sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix type, but he's so effeminate that he's more likely gay than not. One of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze.And the hobgoblins? At the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years. Why? Who knows? Who cares?

Very simple, the movie is about a bunch of Munchies-like gremlins on the loose, exploiting people's desires for fame, fortune, prowess, and of course, sex in ways that end up with people getting killed. But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools), the writing is so forced (such as the oft-described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left... and this isn't the first time in the movie this happens), and the story is so... rarely given attention (hence the MST3K riff about a ""law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers), that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen.

3.0,Purely and patently ridiculous,"Directed, written, and produced by Rick Sloane, Hobgoblins rises above expectations - I was thinking this was just another Gremlins rip-off - to be about diminutive furry wish-granting beasts that look a lot like my cat Norris. I think that's a compliment.Security guards are working at an old movie studio which has a vault of old films and a secret. Dreams come true there, but cost people their lives, like a young guard named Dennis who gets to be a rock star, yet dies on stage.Kevin takes the job to impress his girlfriend Amy, who soon visits along with their friends Kyle, Daphne and Nick. After an extremely long rake battle - yes, you read that - Amy makes fun of her man with Daphne has sex with Nick in his van. Ah, the 80's!The next night, Kevin chases a burglar into the film vault where he releases the hobgoblins, which his boss reveals are aliens that crash landed years ago that he's guarded from people for decades. They have the power to make people's greatest fantasies come true, but then they kill them.Of course, following exploitation film logic, the hobgoblins head to Kevin's house where his friends are already partying. His girlfriend Amy really is the worst girlfriend for Kevin, as there's no way he can handle her fantasy of being a stripper. Everyone heads to Club Scum to rescue her, but the furry little guys soon attack, turning the rub and tug club into chaos.Soon, everyone has to battle their fantasies and the beasts themselves, but of course, everyone makes it out happily, even Nick who seemed to have been blown up earlier. The movie studio gets blown up real good and everyone has sex, except for the dork, who calls a girl for phone sex.This is a movie that has a woman newly released from a mental hospital operating the puppets and a budget so low that they couldn't even get John Carradine to be in the film!

In this film, a night security guard watching some random warehouse doesn't listen to the senior guard and accidentally releases some poor looking, cat-like, puppet hobgoblins. They make people's fantasies come true, then kill them. Everything about this movie is just horrible. The characters are really dumb, and extremely clichéd.

Another very brainless scene has a man sitting in his car while his date tried to shove it down a cliff, and he just sits there like a moron.

4.0,"""You're not young like you used to be""","At times grating, at times hilarious, yet always exceptionally horrendous, Hobgoblins stands out for its immense stupidity and ineptitude. It fails so throughly in so many ways that it deserves a viewing based on that merit alone.It's hard for a movie this bad to fail at being top quality trash, but Hobgoblins somehow manages to. Hobgoblins even fails to deliver some good ole-fashioned nudity, even when the story provides clear opportunities for it.

I would have subtracted five stars for that letdown alone were it not for the marvelous use of grenades that follows shortly after, a fantastic display in which one character gets blown up at point-blank range, and another goes up in flames and runs around screaming while on fire.There are enough hilarious moments here to amuse trash seekers, though not enough to place Hobgoblins anywhere close to the top of their list. Mildly recommended.",youre not young like you used be,at times grating at times hilarious yet always exceptionally horrendous hobgoblins stands out its immense stupidity ineptitude it fails so throughly so many ways that it deserves viewing based that merit alone its hard movie this bad fail at being top quality trash but hobgoblins somehow manages hobgoblins even fails deliver some good ole fashioned nudity even when story provides clear opportunities it ultimate insult is when amy main characters overly prudish incredibly demanding all around despicable girlfriend possessed by gremlins overcome by her real subconscious urges become superslut performs impromptu strip act at club scum this is insulting part doesnt show any skin what failure i would have subtracted five stars that letdown alone were it not marvelous use grenades that follows shortly after fantastic display which one character gets blown up at point blank range another goes up flames runs around screaming while fire there are enough hilarious moments here amuse trash seekers though not enough place hobgoblins anywhere close top their list mildly recommended,0.6150000000000001,0.01694444444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
