2.0,"A unimaginative, pointless, cheap family film","Hopes were not high coming into Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It is the fourth film in a franchise suffering from diminishing returns, plus it was using the stupid idea of smell-o-vision. And this family film does not disappoint.Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) is a top OSS spy who retires after capturing a super villain, Tik Tok, and starts a family with her husband Wilbur (Joel McHale) and stepchildren Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook). A year later a new villain has emerged, the Time Keeper, who speeds up time using the Armageddon Device to punish humanity for wasting time. Marissa is called back by the OSS director, Danger D'Amo (Jeremy Piven), to recapture Tik Tok which should lead them to the Time Keeper. But the Time Keeper sets out to kidnap Rebecca and Cecil because Rebecca has the only thing that could stop the Armageddon Device.There are many problems with Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It's a cheap and unimaginative film where you could easily predict how they would play out. We have seen these story elements so many times before: the dad is a workaholic; there is animosity between step-mum and step-daughter as the step-mum tries to get closer to the children; the revelation of a lie, and so many others. The humour is crude, mostly poo, fart and vomit gags, basically the lowest common denominator which most children will easily outgrow. The other major route of humour is the barrage of puns: time puns, dog puns and smell puns – we're not stupid! The action is rudimentary; it is easy to expect much better from Robert Rodriguez who just uses poor CGI and quick cuts. And if you can't guess who the Time Keeper really is then you haven't seen enough movies. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World feels like it is a movie that is only made for a quick buck, not for any love of the material or the need to tell a good story.A movie aimed at children should be able to enliven their imaginations: Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is not going to do that. The artificial CGI scenes just look too fake for children to accept and buy into the action and the basic predictable plot will mean that children will not love it. Adults and parents will feel nothing but suffering when watching this movie. This is just a mindless movie with no imagination, which is ironic considering it makes a point that children make better spies because they have more imagination. Children are smart; they ask questions, see plot holes and come up with ideas involving sci-fi concepts. The best family and children's movies are clever, well-plotted affairs and often have good ideas behind them. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World does not share those traits. Plus this movie carries on the awful trend of spies with babies not working.Most of the acting is sub-par. The child leads are bland and not natural actors; it's your typical weak-child acting, and they are no Chloe Mortez or Kodi Smit-McPhee. McHale was truly unconvincing as the father and again a typical bad performance in a bad family movie. Alba was a punch bag for gags to be bounded off on. Ricky Gervais seemed to be having fun, but I'm sure that's because he got a paycheck for saying bad lines in a recording studio. Piven is much the same, having fun and just being over the top.As movie fans we expect better from Rodriguez, who's done great movies like Sin City, From Dusk to Dawn and the ""Mexico"" Trilogy. Let's hope he is doing this movie so we can finally get Sin City 2.And I am sure you are asking the big question – what was the Scratch-and-Sniff card like? It was just a bunch of sickly sweet smells and simply just a gimmick.

6.0,I rate this film as a parent who took his kids...,"...Took the family (5 year old son, 2.5 year old daughter) to see Sky Kids 4 today..Speaking as an adult who saw all 3 of the original SPY KIDS movies in the theatre, this is easily the worst of the series. Joel Mchale (who i have actually become a fan of based off his THE SOUP and COMMUNITY work), Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara give some incredibly bad performances. Embarrassingly-so. Jessica Alba does what Jessica Alba does (thank the Gods she's cute and met Robert Rodriguez), and Jeremy Piven....actually i liked Piven. His character had an interesting story- arc, and he gives a solid performance.Some of Ricky Gervais' one-liners were funny, too.The rest of the film was pretty unbearable. However, speaking as a parent who was out hoping to show his kids a good time, i actually have to give this movie a solid rating. My 2 kids enjoyed the heck out of it, from the talking dog to the baby decking a bad guy, the kids loved it. And my son had a lot of fun keeping track of when to engage the AROMASCOPE scratch card.

1.0,"The worst of the series, and one of the worst movies so far this year","I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Spy Kids films, they were fun, entertaining and ideal family films. Spy Kids 3 was rather mediocre and disappointing, but any horrible assets that film had was nothing compared to this.When I entered the theatre to watch this, yes I wanted to see it despite the trailer not looking that good, I thought if it is bad surely it can't be as bad as The Adventures of Sharkboy and LavaGirl. I was wrong, as awful as that film was Spy Kids 4 takes the cake as Rodriguez's worst film.The film for starters looks cheap. The camera work at best is odd, and the effects lack clarity. The gadgets looked cool from the outset but once the nappy bombs for instance are introduced they lose their appeal very quickly.I didn't think much of the soundtrack either. I found it rather generic here rather than jaunty and memorable. And Rodriguez's direction is his most unfocused and inept directing job in my opinion of his career.The script is awful, relying far too much on tired slapstick and heavy-handed messaging, while the story is rushed and much too thin for the film's running time and the action is dull and not helped by the haphazard editing.Acting-wise, this film is disappointing. It was nice to be Daryl Sabarra and Alexa Vega here but other than the basic concept of the movie, them and Rodriguez, there seemed to be no connection to its predecessors. The new kids do what they can, but they aren't as confident or as appealing.Jeremy Piven does give his all into a very underwritten and uninteresting villain part and his two other roles as well but at points it feels like he's overdoing it. Danny Trejo is wasted, Antonio Banderas was cut which is yet another reason why this doesn't feel like a Spy Kids movie, Jessica Alba does nothing with her role other than look pretty, while even Ricky Gervais is flat.The cast are not helped by how their characters are written. The characters here are so cardboard, it is difficult to engage with them on any level.Overall, despite the trailer I was all for seeing this film. But it was awful(as part of a franchise and on its own terms) and a big disappointment. 1/10 Bethany Cox",worst series one worst movies so far this year,i thoroughly enjoyed first two spy kids films they were fun entertaining ideal family films spy kids 3 was rather mediocre disappointing but any horrible assets that film had was nothing compared this when i entered theatre watch this yes i wanted see it despite trailer not looking that good i thought if it is bad surely it cant be as bad as adventures sharkboy lavagirl i was wrong as awful as that film was spy kids 4 takes cake as rodriguezs worst film film starters looks cheap camera work at best is odd effects lack clarity gadgets looked cool outset but once nappy bombs instance are introduced they lose their appeal very quickly i didnt think much soundtrack either i found it rather generic here rather than jaunty memorable rodriguezs direction is his most unfocused inept directing job my opinion his career script is awful relying far too much tired slapstick heavy handed messaging while story is rushed much too thin films running time action is dull not helped by haphazard editing acting wise this film is disappointing it was nice be daryl sabarra alexa vega here but other than basic concept movie them rodriguez there seemed be no connection its predecessors new kids do what they can but they arent as confident or as appealing jeremy piven does give his all into very underwritten uninteresting villain part his two other roles as well but at points it feels like hes overdoing it danny trejo is wasted antonio banderas was cut which is yet another reason why this doesnt feel like spy kids movie jessica alba does nothing with her role other than look pretty while even ricky gervais is flat cast are not helped by how their characters are written characters here are so cardboard it is difficult engage with them any level overall despite trailer i was all seeing this film but it was awful as part franchise its own terms big disappointment 1 10 bethany cox,0.6141109369557645,-0.06445924764890282,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,A Juvenile Effort Meant for those Under Five,"I have often said that in order to enjoy mindless movies like ""Transformers"", we should ""leave our brains at the door of the cineplex"". Well, in order to enjoy this ""Spy Kids"" sequel, we need to lower our IQ to the level of four-year olds! 'Mindlessness' doesn't quite cut it, it is juvenile indulgence, meaning, it is only for kids below five.And if you have been following the cinema ads and promos, you would know that this movie comes in 4D - with the added dimension of 'smell'. For that, viewers are given a numbered card (called Aroma-Scope) so that they can scratch-and-smell when the number appears on the screen. This is a childish gimmick aimed at kids. For adults, it is more of a nuisance because the scents are faint and the exercise distracts us from the action on the screen. Although there are many fart and poop scenes, the Aroma-Scope only provides scents of chewing gum and other edible stuff (thank goodness for that). History has demonstrated that all smell-o-vision gimmicks mostly stink.Marissa Cortez Wilson (Jessica Alba) is such a dedicated spy that even when she is nine months pregnant, she manages to take down notorious villain Tick Tock (Jeremy Piven) before going into labor and retiring from her spy duties. Her aim is to devote all her time to her newborn and her step-kids, Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook) and hubby Wilbur (Joey McHale).Soon, however, she may not have that much time. One year later, Tick Tock and accomplice, The Timekeeper (also Piven), are back at their attempt to rob the world of 'time' - and Rebecca, Cecil and their 'guard dog' Argonaut (voice of Ricky Gervais) must save the world (what else?). Also, they team up with Marissa's niece and nephew, Carmen and Juni Cortez (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara reprising their former Spy Kids roles) to make this mission a family reunion of sorts.Writer-director Robert Rodriguez seems to be milking the same old cinema-script cow, urging parents to spend more time with their kids. This 'message' has been used by almost all family movies throughout the decade. The time-theft and time-travel conceits can be puzzling to children even if they allow Rodriguez to make use of all sorts of time-related gags. Of course, Rodriguez cannot resist the poop and fart gags, as well as throwing food all over the place. These, I understand, are the laugh-out-loud staple for American kids below five.Among the cast, Blanchard and Cook are suitably cute and effective as the new title characters. Bringing back former Spy Kids, Vega and Sabara, is a good idea, adding a nostalgic touch for parents in the audience. Ditto that for Danny Trejo's short cameo as Uncle Machete. However, the irony of Daddy Wilbur being a 'Spycatcher' on TV is lost on the kids and scores no points with the adults.As for Jessica Alba (as Marissa, the younger sister to Antonio Bandera's character), she provides the main box-office lure, nothing more. Strictly kids' stuff.

,Multiple Copies,"I'm aware that many people like to encounter films as a small, unchallenging adventure. That isn't possible with me, but I have something similar: sometimes a simple film is a relaxed encounter with the filmmaker, a sort of illustrated visit in his home.I like Rodriguez. I like his joy in image and his independent enthusiasm. I do not ever expect him to produce something that changes my life, like fellow Austinite Malick can. But sometimes you just want to hang out. One thing that is impressive is knowing that he creates his films mostly in his own studio with greenscreen, networked to special effects subcontractors. He must have had to do things that few others do in order for his work to seamlessly integrate with his life.So, though there is nothing profound about him except his passion, visiting a film can simply relax into that passion. I am particularly hooked on the Spy Kids franchise because the first one had so many inside references to old AI tools and techniques that I assume he worked very closely with someone from that era, perhaps even someone I know. Perhaps it was a side effect from setting up his personal production infrastructure.But it also because I know he is coming at this as a dad who enjoys his kids and basically wants to share at a cinematic level. That is why, for instance that I tolerate the over top 'dad message' about the importance of spending time with your kids now rather than be absent in a studio. (Yes, that is the basic plot.)The first film was themed on AI as mentioned. The second on genetics, and the third on a Tron-like game. This one plays — in the most superficial way — with speculations on parallel universes and time joins. Others will inform about the amazingly bad acting by both pairs of siblings, the really off- beat pacing and the general heavy-handed nature of the thing. But under all that is a genuine human, being genuine and open, inviting us into the world he decorated himself (there's a joke about that). Where else but with Rose's influence will you get a superspy kicking butt first as she goes into labor and later with the baby strapped on her chest. That alone will stick with you.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",multiple copies,im aware that many people like encounter films as small unchallenging adventure that isnt possible with me but i have something similar sometimes simple film is relaxed encounter with filmmaker sort illustrated visit his home i like rodriguez i like his joy image his independent enthusiasm i do not ever expect him produce something that changes my life like fellow austinite malick can but sometimes you just want hang out one thing that is impressive is knowing that he creates his films mostly his own studio with greenscreen networked special effects subcontractors he must have had do things that few others do order his work seamlessly integrate with his life so though there is nothing profound about him except his passion visiting film can simply relax into that passion i am particularly hooked spy kids franchise because first one had so many inside references old ai tools techniques that i assume he worked very closely with someone that era perhaps even someone i know perhaps it was side effect setting up his personal production infrastructure but it also because i know he is coming at this as dad who enjoys his kids basically wants share at cinematic level that is why instance that i tolerate over top dad message about importance spending time with your kids now rather than be absent studio yes that is basic plot first film was themed ai as mentioned second genetics third tron like game this one plays most superficial way with speculations parallel universes time joins others will inform about amazingly bad acting by both pairs siblings really off beat pacing general heavy handed nature thing but under all that is genuine human being genuine open inviting us into world he decorated himself theres joke about that where else but with roses influence will you get superspy kicking butt first as she goes into labor later with baby strapped her chest that alone will stick with you teds evaluation 3 3 worth watching,0.353015873015873,0.14904761904761904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.39}"

4.0,Escapism at its finest.,"The real purpose of a movie is to entertain (escapism) - to distance you from your problems for a short period of time. If you will look at this movie from the perspective of a person viewing movies for entertainment purposes, then this movie is good (not very good since there are a lot of better escapist movies out there). If you look at it from the perspective of a movie critic, then this is a horrible movie, filled with clichés and poop jokes.The first film of this franchise may have had some cliché plot points, but it didn't rely on poop and fart jokes to move the story or try to make the viewer laugh.This movie has the usual 'stepdaughter-hates-stepmom' and the 'geeky brother' story lines along with the happily ever after ending. It seems the movie thinks that watching these story lines is entertaining to kids, when in fact, it's not (speaking from my perspective as a 13 year old kid). To be frank, it's quite annoying.However, this movie doesn't lack on the entertainment value. CGI all-around, gadgets everywhere, this movie has tons of cool stuff to keep the viewer at the edge of their seat. There are jokes that if you watch first may seem funny, but in the end will make you think ""is that joke really funny, or is it offensive"".Bottomline is, this movie can be good or bad, depending on your perspective.

7.0,"Not bad, but please be more original.","Writer, director Robert Rodriguez, seems to like to entertain kids, or he's just bored, reviving a franchise that does need to be. Now I was entertained by the first two Spy Kids movies, but the third one was rip off of Tron(1982).Jessica Alba is amusing in her role, as a retired spy, wanting to become stepmother to her husbands(Joel McHale The Soup)kids, and having one of her own. But then an old enemy comes back in the picture, and she is called back into action. But will her husbands kids become the new spy kids?The two original spy kids make an appearance, they are Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara, and you know they are not kids anymore.

1.0,Possibly the worst movie of all time!,"This movie is not only the worst movie of the summer, it could possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen. I took my two boys aged 7 and 4 to watch this sorry excuse for a movie. The boys actually were fairly entertained, but I must say they are not exactly seasoned veterans of the movie watching experience.We saw it in 2D but also had the '4th D' experience. This amounted to a card they gave you that you scratch and sniff at certain points during the movie. It is a horrible gimmick that does not even work. I scratched as hard as I could and could only smell a faint flowery smell. That is only one minor flaw of the movie.The other flaws are as follow. The acting is horrendous. How they continue to let Jessica Alba act and even STAR in a movie is a decision that some Hollywood exec will eventually pay for with their job. Her lack of acting abilities were only surpassed by the rest of the cast. But it was not entirely their fault as the film's basic plot and script was about as thin as Kate Moss on a hunger strike.So what do you combine with horrible acting, a thin plot and countless moronic lines written by the worst screen writers they could dig up? Mindless violence that is not suitable for small children. This movie is supposed to be about spy kids I presumed, based on the title. Most of the scenes and actions were played out by adults and the plethora of punching and kicking scenes was immature and detrimental to young, easily influenced minds.This movie is disturbing for young children and is completely inappropriate for children of all ages. It also is so horribly acted and the screenplay so ill-conceived that adults are left wondering how in the world Hollywood can continue to put out such dribble and expect us to shell out our hard earned dollars on such mindless 'entertainment.'To sum it all up, avoid this movie at all costs. Even if your children have seen the other versions and beg you to see it be strong and suggest alternatives. Show Hollywood that you will not be swayed by their slick advertising and inept film-making.",possibly worst movie all time,this movie is not only worst movie summer it could possibly be worst movie i have ever seen i took my two boys aged 7 4 watch this sorry excuse movie boys actually were fairly entertained but i must say they are not exactly seasoned veterans movie watching experience we saw it 2d but also had 4th d experience this amounted card they gave you that you scratch sniff at certain points during movie it is horrible gimmick that does not even work i scratched as hard as i could could only smell faint flowery smell that is only one minor flaw movie other flaws are as follow acting is horrendous how they continue let jessica alba act even star movie is decision that some hollywood exec will eventually pay with their job her lack acting abilities were only surpassed by rest cast but it was not entirely their fault as films basic plot script was about as thin as kate moss hunger strike so what do you combine with horrible acting thin plot countless moronic lines written by worst screen writers they could dig up mindless violence that is not suitable small children this movie is supposed be about spy kids i presumed based title most scenes actions were played out by adults plethora punching kicking scenes was immature detrimental young easily influenced minds this movie is disturbing young children is completely inappropriate children all ages it also is so horribly acted screenplay so ill conceived that adults are left wondering how world hollywood can continue put out such dribble expect us shell out our hard earned dollars such mindless entertainment sum it all up avoid this movie at all costs even if your children have seen other versions beg you see it be strong suggest alternatives show hollywood that you will not be swayed by their slick advertising inept film making,0.6176339285714284,-0.1990079365079365,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,Not Bad At All!,"In one of the most surprising happenings that occurred to me, I found out that I actually liked the fourth installment in the Spy Kids franchise for the most part. The first two films are definitely better but this is way better than the horrid third film. I guess I liked this film because it brought back so many memories from my childhood. That was true when Carmen and Juni appeared on screen. I know the acting was cheesy and there were plenty of potty humor, but I couldn't bring myself to hate this film.Robert Rodriguez's film is about an evil guy who is bent on making time go faster so a retired spy and her kids are recruited to turn time back to normal.As I mentioned earlier, the acting is kind of cheesy. Jessica Alba is pretty good and is quite nice on the eyes. The kids are decent even though they say some weird stuff. Ricky Gervais makes an awesome dog with his voice.Overall, this is a decent film but I can see why many people despised it. Despite my thumbs up, I think it's time for this franchise to hit the bucket as I can see some wear and tear. This film wasn't even asked for in the first place but it's a nice distraction for the kids. It doesn't have the great visuals as the earlier films, but it wont matter to the kids.

2.0,Stop dropping the title,"I have very fond memories of the original ""Spy Kids"" movie that came out in 2001. Ever since then, a sequel was made once a year probably so the lead kids wouldn't get older. They ended up making a sequel eight years later and it's even more pointless than you would imagine. This movie features a new stepmother who's a spy trying to stop a villain named Tick Tock (really dumb supervillain name) along with the Timekeeper. We get this tired cliché that actually happens to both parents in different jobs, not having enough time for their kids. The worst thing about this movie is the crude humor.There's a robot dog that literally pees oil and poops bombs. Oh, and he can fart for no reason other than that it entertains him. Farting dogs didn't work in ""Space Buddies"", why did they think they would work here? There's even one scene where the boy character has to throw up in barf bags so he can throw his barf at the bad guys. This was released in something called 4-D, which apparently added smells or something when it was in theaters. The 3D looks horribly out of place and if 3-D is dead, 4-D was the nail in the coffin.The special effects are really bad and I read that this movie was mostly made because of something Robert Rodriguez had in his contract with Harvey Weinstein. We should have been to tell he was a huge scumbag for being responsible for this atrocity. These movies started out great, but declined in quality with every sequel all leading up to the worst one of them all. Seriously, the original only has a rating of 5.5 here? It's got a 93% on RottenTomatoes! Any film with a baby throwing food in her mother's cleavage can't be good. *",stop dropping title,i have very fond memories original spy kids movie that came out 2001 ever since then sequel was made once year probably so lead kids wouldnt get older they ended up making sequel eight years later its even more pointless than you would imagine this movie features new stepmother whos spy trying stop villain named tick tock really dumb supervillain name along with timekeeper we get this tired clich that actually happens both parents different jobs not having enough time their kids worst thing about this movie is crude humor theres robot dog that literally pees oil poops bombs oh he can fart no reason other than that it entertains him farting dogs didnt work space buddies why did they think they would work here theres even one scene where boy character has throw up barf bags so he can throw his barf at bad guys this was released something called 4 d which apparently added smells or something when it was theaters 3d looks horribly out place if 3 d is dead 4 d was nail coffin special effects are really bad i read that this movie was mostly made because something robert rodriguez had his contract with harvey weinstein we should have been tell he was huge scumbag being responsible this atrocity these movies started out great but declined quality with every sequel all leading up worst one them all seriously original only has rating 5 5 here its got 93 rottentomatoes any film with baby throwing food her mothers cleavage cant be good,0.5971600238841619,-0.058269891028511704,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
3.0,I wish they'd just stopped after the first one.,"The original ""Spy Kids"" movie was a cute little kids film which was actually enjoyable for adults as well. So, the studio did what they often do...take a good idea and beat it to death with sequel after sequel! As a result, his fourth installment managed something no other ""Spy Kids"" movie did...it managed to make IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. In other words, it's among the 100 wide release films that are hated most by IMDB users.In order to try to keep interest in the franchise, later films added gimmicks to keep the kids interested. This one has several....it's in 3D, it has 'smell-o-vision' (theaters were equipped with machines that dispensed scents) and there's a talking robotic dog....all of which loudly scream out 'jumped the shark'.When the movie begins, you'll notice that barely anyone from the original movie is here. This makes sense, as the two children from the first one were no longer kids...as a decade has passed. Interesting, the fully grown kids from the original films DO show up later in this movie as their original characters. And, since the kids in the film are new, so are the parents. One is a TV host of a show called ""Spy Hunter"", the step-mom is an actual spy for OSS*.When a super-villain named the Time Keeper starts affecting the passage of time, the step-mom is called into action. Almost immediately after, minions of this baddie show up and try to abduct the kids...and they realize their step is a spy! How do the kids defeat this first wave of minions? By hurling puke bags at them...an excellent metaphor for this picture!So, was there anything I liked about this film? A few things. I appreciated how the boy in the film wore hearing aids. You rarely have deaf or hard of hearing characters in movies. The only sad part is that it didn't look as if they hired an actual hard of hearing kid for this part. The look of the film is also nice...they clearly spent money on the movie and came up with some cool gadgets. And, finally, I did appreciate that they brought back the grown up spy kids...a nice touch.What I disliked mostly was the scatological nature of much of the film. These were just gross and unnecessary...and guaranteed to offend and bring down the quality of the production. The film also lacks originality and it looks like there have just been a few too many trips to the well, so to speak. What was original, but unwanted, was the robot dog. While a few of his comments were kind of clever, mostly he was there to provide potty humor.The bottom line is that I definitely did NOT like this film but feel that kids may like it...parents certainly won't in most cases. The same things that turned me off might be enjoyed by some kids...especially the robotic dog. So, I'll give it a 1 for parents and a 5 for kids...and will split the difference for my overall score.*There really was an OSS. The Office of Strategic Services was created for WWII and later was renamed the CIA.Three times could be the charm...but what about four??",i wish theyd just stopped after first one,original spy kids movie was cute little kids film which was actually enjoyable adults as well so studio did what they often do take good idea beat it death with sequel after sequel as result his fourth installment managed something no other spy kids movie did it managed make imdbs infamous bottom 100 list other words its among 100 wide release films that are hated most by imdb users order try keep interest franchise later films added gimmicks keep kids interested this one has several its 3d it has smell o vision theaters were equipped with machines that dispensed scents theres talking robotic dog all which loudly scream out jumped shark when movie begins youll notice that barely anyone original movie is here this makes sense as two children first one were no longer kids as decade has passed interesting fully grown kids original films do show up later this movie as their original characters since kids film are new so are parents one is tv host show called spy hunter step mom is actual spy oss when super villain named time keeper starts affecting passage time step mom is called into action almost immediately after minions this baddie show up try abduct kids they realize their step is spy how do kids defeat this first wave minions by hurling puke bags at them excellent metaphor this picture so was there anything i liked about this film few things i appreciated how boy film wore hearing aids you rarely have deaf or hard hearing characters movies only sad part is that it didnt look as if they hired actual hard hearing kid this part look film is also nice they clearly spent money movie came up with some cool gadgets finally i did appreciate that they brought back grown up spy kids nice touch what i disliked mostly was scatological nature much film these were just gross unnecessary guaranteed offend bring down quality production film also lacks originality it looks like there have just been few too many trips well so speak what was original but unwanted was robot dog while few his comments were kind clever mostly he was there provide potty humor bottom line is that i definitely did not like this film but feel that kids may like it parents certainly wont most cases same things that turned me off might be enjoyed by some kids especially robotic dog so ill give it 1 parents 5 kids will split difference my overall score there really was oss office strategic services was created wwii later was renamed cia three times could be charm but what about four,0.4851187862057428,0.1266197168371081,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.37, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.28}"
4.0,"Kids will get a kick out if it, but it's not a patch on the first movies","Like Jaws 4 and Superman IV: The Quest For Peace. Spy Kids 4 or ""Spy Kids: All The Time In The World"" is a Franchise killer. Although it was a moderate financial success against its $27 million budget. It is such a poor movie, it ended any interest in any future movies. Mason Cook (in his first movie) and Rowan Blanchard (in her 2nd) are not as annoying as most child actors and are certainly cute enough, but they lack the chemistry that Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabra had in the first three movies. So Jessica Alba is pretty much left to carry the movie on her own. She tries hard but the movie is missing some of the charm and magic that made the first movies so likable. It also misses the talents of Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino.

,Farty fun for kids,"I went to see this 4th entry in Robert Rodrigez' Spy Kids series with a 9 year old and a 13 year old, and they thoroughly enjoyed it. They enjoyed the story and the action, and they laughed at the slapstick, and the humour (much of which involved unsavoury smells and substances emanating from a dog and a baby). This film was pretty much pitched straight at them, and worked very successfully - on that level I must judge it a critical success.Personally, as an adult male, Jessica Alba in tight leather is probably the high point of this movie, although I have to say that she is very ready to make herself the butt of sight gags. Apart from that it is mildly, but not greatly, entertaining (I find fart jokes funny, so that was a plus).Rodriguez has fun playing with 3D - the use in this film is far more gimmicky than in most of the other 3D movies over the last two or three years.To address one of the criticisms levelled at this movie: yes, the message is one that we have seen a hundred times in movies before.

Meanwhile, Marissa's husband Wilbur is launching a new reality show that follows him as he tries to catch spies. Unbeknownst to Wilbur, his wife is a spy and has been called out of retirement to stop Tick Tock and his boss, the Timekeeper, from stopping time. As Marissa is dragged back into service, her niece Carmen recruits Rebecca and Cecil in an effort to revive the OSS's now-defunct Spy Kids Division.The performances range from solid to fantastic. Newcomers Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook play off each other well as the squabbling twin siblings. I hope they'll continue to do well in the future. As the kids are recruited, they learn that their dog Argonaut is actually an OSS-issue robot dog being used to supervise them. Ricky Gervais provides Argonaut's wisecracking voice, and you can tell he's having fun doing it. Joel McHale's specialty is playing the man who doesn't have all the answers but is positive he does. Wilbur Wilson is one such overly cocky character, and McHale throws himself into the role with his typical wacky aplomb. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara return as original Spy Kids Carmen and Juni Cortez. Their roles are relatively small now, but Vega and Sabara retain the chemistry that makes them so believable as siblings. Jessica Alba proves she's more than just a pretty face, showing pathos and surprising comic timing as Marissa tries to save the world and patch up her relationship with Rebecca.Jeremy Piven gets his own paragraph because he probably has the hardest job in the movie, playing the triple roles of the Timekeeper, Tick Tock, and Danger D'Amo. While the Timekeeper is something of a stereotypical supervillain, Piven's other roles come with unique challenges. He completely transforms his face and voice as the grotesque henchman Tick Tock; in fact, I wouldn't have known it was him if I hadn't seen him on Leno and Kimmel; but his third role is the toughest. The Timekeeper turns out to be none other than Danger, who is desperately trying to reconnect with his late father after a time-travel experiment in his childhood separated them. His sorrow and regret seemed to run deeper than the D'Amos and their time-travel experiment to Piven and his own late father, a suspicion that was later confirmed in an online interview. Watching him long for what can never be was heartwrenching and made me wish I could step into the movie and try to comfort him-both Danger and Piven. Playing what is billed as a triple role but comes closer to 24 roles once henchmen, duplicates, time travel, and the elder D'Amo are factored in is fraught with physical and emotional challenges, all of which Piven handles superbly. He gives his multiple roles his all, and as a result he may have delivered one of the best underrated performances of the year.I would like to conclude by mentioning that Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D is already getting Razzie buzz-and that said Razzie buzz is largely undeserved. Go to this movie expecting nothing but a good time with a good message-you might be surprised at what you find. I was, and I can't wait for the Blu-ray so I can relive my amazing discoveries in the comfort of my own home.",not oscar caliber but high concept family fun oh 24 pivens,i dont understand why this movie is getting panned so badly no its not oscar quality but most movies arent when i go movies my goal is usually just have good time spy kids all time world fit bill me with added bonus message that so often goes ignored record movie is billed as 4d but i saw it 2d without aromascope card anyone who hasnt heard much about this movie heres brief synopsis oss im sorry ive forgotten what it stands agent marissa cortez wilson makes deal with oss chief danger damo she can retire raise family after one last mission capturing villainous tick tock who has stolen vital oss information year later shes raising her baby daughter trying bond with her twin stepkids rebecca cecil but rebecca still resents her trying take place twins late mom meanwhile marissas husband wilbur is launching new reality show that follows him as he tries catch spies unbeknownst wilbur his wife is spy has been called out retirement stop tick tock his boss timekeeper stopping time as marissa is dragged back into service her niece carmen recruits rebecca cecil effort revive osss now defunct spy kids division performances range solid fantastic newcomers rowan blanchard mason cook play off each other well as squabbling twin siblings i hope theyll continue do well future as kids are recruited they learn that their dog argonaut is actually oss issue robot dog being used supervise them ricky gervais provides argonauts wisecracking voice you can tell hes having fun doing it joel mchales specialty is playing man who doesnt have all answers but is positive he does wilbur wilson is one such overly cocky character mchale throws himself into role with his typical wacky aplomb alexa vega daryl sabara return as original spy kids carmen juni cortez their roles are relatively small now but vega sabara retain chemistry that makes them so believable as siblings jessica alba proves shes more than just pretty face showing pathos surprising comic timing as marissa tries save world patch up her relationship with rebecca jeremy piven gets his own paragraph because he probably has hardest job movie playing triple roles timekeeper tick tock danger damo while timekeeper is something stereotypical supervillain pivens other roles come with unique challenges he completely transforms his face voice as grotesque henchman tick tock fact i wouldnt have known it was him if i hadnt seen him leno kimmel but his third role is toughest timekeeper turns out be none other than danger who is desperately trying reconnect with his late father after time travel experiment his childhood separated them his sorrow regret seemed run deeper than damos their time travel experiment piven his own late father suspicion that was later confirmed online interview watching him long what can never be was heartwrenching made me wish i could step into movie try comfort him both danger piven playing what is billed as triple role but comes closer 24 roles once henchmen duplicates time travel elder damo are factored is fraught with physical emotional challenges all which piven handles superbly he gives his multiple roles his all as result he may have delivered one best underrated performances year i would like conclude by mentioning that spy kids all time world 4d is already getting razzie buzz that said razzie buzz is largely undeserved go this movie expecting nothing but good time with good message you might be surprised at what you find i was i cant wait blu ray so i can relive my amazing discoveries comfort my own home,0.5166591080876795,0.14415824915824915,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
