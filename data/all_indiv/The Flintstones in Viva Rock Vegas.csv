6.0,Why all the hate towards this film?!,"When both Flintstone movies came out, my daughter wanted to see them, so we did. I was not especially impressed by the films...but I thought they weren't bad. Well, apparently I am not the typical viewer, as both films (especially ""Viva Rock Vegas"") have very low scores on IMDB...and ""Viva Rock Vegas"" now made the Bottom 100 list following the recent changes to this list (increasing the minimum number of votes greatly impacted the list....and about 2/3 of the films are new to the list). Because of this change, I decided to try seeing the film again....and perhaps I was mistaken the first time.The first thing you'll notice is that although the look of the film is great (much like the first film), all the principal actors are different. Apparently, the studio had a hard time getting the old actors to commit to the film...so to try to get around this, the movie is supposed to be a prequel which occurred long before the Spielberg film.When the story begins, Gazoo is being punished for some unknown mistakes. His punishment is to be banished to Earth to observe human mating rituals. Not surprisingly, he picks Fred and Barney to follow...as the boys have not yet met Betty and Wilma. Once they do, they all fall in love but it doesn't go THAT smoothly. First, Wilma comes from a rich and snooty family...and they have no interest in low-brow Fred. Second, Wilma's old boyfriend invites the four of them to Rock Vegas....and he obviously has some underhanded scheme in mind for them. Third, once in Rock Vegas, Betty mistakenly thinks Barney is chasing another woman and she ends up being one of Mick Jagged's entourage.So was I wrong the first time? I don't think so. While the film isn't exactly brilliant, it is what it is supposed to be...a live action version of a cartoon...no more, no less. And, despite me not seeing it with my daughter this time, I had a fine time watching the film. Pleasant and adequate...and not at all deserving all the hate it's received. Believe me...there are many, many, many worse kids films, such as ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", ""Baby Geniuses"" (1 and 2), ""Son of the Mask"" and most of the ""Land Before Time"" films (they made 14 of them!!!). Don't be afraid to buck conventional wisdom, as I think this film is enjoyable and a decent story to watch with your kids.",why all hate towards this film,when both flintstone movies came out my daughter wanted see them so we did i was not especially impressed by films but i thought they werent bad well apparently i am not typical viewer as both films especially viva rock vegas have very low scores imdb viva rock vegas now made bottom 100 list following recent changes this list increasing minimum number votes greatly impacted list about 2 3 films are new list because this change i decided try seeing film again perhaps i was mistaken first time first thing youll notice is that although look film is great much like first film all principal actors are different apparently studio had hard time getting old actors commit film so try get around this movie is supposed be prequel which occurred long before spielberg film when story begins gazoo is being punished some unknown mistakes his punishment is be banished earth observe human mating rituals not surprisingly he picks fred barney follow as boys have not yet met betty wilma once they do they all fall love but it doesnt go that smoothly first wilma comes rich snooty family they have no interest low brow fred second wilmas old boyfriend invites four them rock vegas he obviously has some underhanded scheme mind them third once rock vegas betty mistakenly thinks barney is chasing another woman she ends up being one mick jaggeds entourage so was i wrong first time i dont think so while film isnt exactly brilliant it is what it is supposed be live action version cartoon no more no less despite me not seeing it with my daughter this time i had fine time watching film pleasant adequate not at all deserving all hate its received believe me there are many many many worse kids films such as santa claus conquers martians baby geniuses 1 2 son mask most land before time films they made 14 them dont be afraid buck conventional wisdom as i think this film is enjoyable decent story watch with your kids,0.4898117291513518,0.09679000245037982,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
6.0,"Better than expected prequel, and a decent movie","I came on here to review this movie, and I was really surprised at the rating. I didn't think the movie was that bad. It is flawed in a lot of ways, but there is some fun embedded in the film. I am stuck on whether it is better than the 1994 movie or inferior. If I were to be picky, I would say better in some areas, inferior in others. My main flaws were with the script and some of the plot. The script is weak in places, but has some funny moments, mainly with the little green alien. The plot I think is stronger than the one in the 1994 movie, but slower in pace and does suffer from one or two hasty and over-familiar subplots like Chip stealing Wilma's necklace and framing Fred. I liked it though that it detailed of how Fred and Wilma met, and the scene at the bowling area was sweet with the Nutcracker serving as background music. Mark Addy looks more the part of Fred than John Goodman, but I felt that he slightly underplayed, and I did find Stephen Baldwin too tall and too gormless as Barney. However, Kristen Johnson is wonderfully voluptuous as Wilma and Jane Krakowski, what can I say, better than Rosie O'Donnell. As much as I like O'Donnell, she wasn't quite right for Betty in the 1994 film, Krakowski was perfect. In terms of supporting actors, Alan Cumming is amusing as Mick Jagged and even better as Gazoo and Joan Collins is a sheer delight as Pearl. Thomas Gibson has his moments as Chip. The soundtrack is great, and the scenery, costumes and design of Dino were spot on. Plus that little alien is cute, and the dance routine at the end was lots of fun. All in all, has its flaws but it's a fun prequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox",better than expected prequel decent movie,i came here review this movie i was really surprised at rating i didnt think movie was that bad it is flawed lot ways but there is some fun embedded film i am stuck whether it is better than 1994 movie or inferior if i were be picky i would say better some areas inferior others my main flaws were with script some plot script is weak places but has some funny moments mainly with little green alien plot i think is stronger than one 1994 movie but slower pace does suffer one or two hasty over familiar subplots like chip stealing wilmas necklace framing fred i liked it though that it detailed how fred wilma met scene at bowling area was sweet with nutcracker serving as background music mark addy looks more part fred than john goodman but i felt that he slightly underplayed i did find stephen baldwin too tall too gormless as barney however kristen johnson is wonderfully voluptuous as wilma jane krakowski what can i say better than rosie odonnell as much as i like odonnell she wasnt quite right betty 1994 film krakowski was perfect terms supporting actors alan cumming is amusing as mick jagged even better as gazoo joan collins is sheer delight as pearl thomas gibson has his moments as chip soundtrack is great scenery costumes design dino were spot plus that little alien is cute dance routine at end was lots fun all all has its flaws but its fun prequel 6 10 bethany cox,0.5723616473616473,0.22146074646074643,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.25}"

8.0,"Lighten up, Francis. It's a cartoon sequel.","Way too many critical comments. This is a cute family movie with just enough humor and tensions and moral to suit all viewers regardless of age.

8.0,A prequel to the first movie with a different cast and almost as good,"While critics love to bash the two live-action versions of ""The Flintstones"" and the ratings at IMDb are surprisingly low, the first film was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because it's a great movie for what it is. The second one came out six years later in 2000 and features a different cast, which is appropriate since the story is a prequel, taking place when the four main characters are in their late teens or early twenties and romance blossoms between the couples.Although Mark Addy as Fred isn't as good as John Goodman, he's a more-than-acceptable substitute and, besides, Fred is much younger here so it's fitting. Stephen Baldwin is even better (slightly) than Rick Moranis as Barney. Jane Krakowski is also better than Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, not to mention one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet. As for Wilma, Kristen Johnston isn't technically as good as Elizabeth Perkins because the latter had Wilma's 'look' to a ""T"" and Johnston is noticeably too tall, but she makes up for it with her goofy charisma that can't be beat. Lastly, who better to replace Elizabeth Taylor as Fred's stepmother than Joan Collins? Both Flintstones movies are easy prey to incessant panning because they're based on a 60's cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, do they work for what they are and the answer is a resounding ""yes""! Movies must be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve, not according to what they aren't. For instance, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is a goofy comedy and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original ""Apocalypse Now"" it's a throwaway flick, but how does it stack-up to other silly comedies? It's the same thing with both Flintstones movies – how do they stack up to other live-action versions of cartoons? Are they amusing? I always loved Gazoo and he's effectively brought to life in ""Viva Rock Vegas."" The sets and F/X are top-of-the line and hold up to this day. Being a prequel, it's natural to think that the producers lowered the budget, but this wasn't the case at all. The original cost $45 million while this one cost a whopping $83 million; but, while the first film raked in $360 million worldwide, this one only made $60 million.Like the first movie, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.The first two acts of ""Viva Rock Vegas"" are just as entertaining as the previous film, but there aren't as many laughs in the third act as the plot busily ties things up. Don't get me wrong, the third act is eventful and amusing, but there simply aren't as many laughs as the first two acts. Nevertheless, ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is entertaining from beginning to end as a live-action cinematic rendition of the cartoon and wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Parmount Ranch, Agoura, California, and Page, Arizona.GRADE: A-",prequel first movie with different cast almost as good,while critics love bash two live action versions flintstones ratings at imdb are surprisingly low first film was huge hit 1994 fittingly so because its great movie what it is second one came out six years later 2000 features different cast which is appropriate since story is prequel taking place when four main characters are their late teens or early twenties romance blossoms between couples although mark addy as fred isnt as good as john goodman hes more than acceptable substitute besides fred is much younger here so its fitting stephen baldwin is even better slightly than rick moranis as barney jane krakowski is also better than rosie odonnell as betty not mention one most beautiful women walk planet as wilma kristen johnston isnt technically as good as elizabeth perkins because latter had wilmas look t johnston is noticeably too tall but she makes up it with her goofy charisma that cant be beat lastly who better replace elizabeth taylor as freds stepmother than joan collins both flintstones movies are easy prey incessant panning because theyre based 60s cartoon so freaking what question is do they work what they are answer is resounding yes movies must be critiqued graded according what they are aspire achieve not according what they arent instance ace ventura pet detective is goofy comedy should be reviewed that level compared original apocalypse now its throwaway flick but how does it stack up other silly comedies its same thing with both flintstones movies how do they stack up other live action versions cartoons are they amusing i always loved gazoo hes effectively brought life viva rock vegas sets f x are top line hold up this day being prequel its natural think that producers lowered budget but this wasnt case at all original cost 45 million while this one cost whopping 83 million but while first film raked 360 million worldwide this one only made 60 million like first movie story has warmth offers realistic worthy themes take instance fred barneys bond theyre best friends their personalities balance each other out youll see this real life my best friend example is similar some ways barney while i more fit fred role first two acts viva rock vegas are just as entertaining as previous film but there arent as many laughs third act as plot busily ties things up dont get me wrong third act is eventful amusing but there simply arent as many laughs as first two acts nevertheless flintstones viva rock vegas is entertaining beginning end as live action cinematic rendition cartoon wisely doesnt overstay its welcome at 91 minutes film was shot at vasquez rocks santa clarita parmount ranch agoura california page arizona grade,0.4798992673992674,0.2782148407148407,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,A Sequel That Is a Prequel That Is Not Equal to the Original,"Like its predecessor, ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" tries to be likeable. However, this film is not quite up to par with the original. This version deals with the way the Flintstones came into existence. Young dino-crane operators Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) find true love in fast-food waitresses Wilma (Kristen Johnston) and Betty (Jane Krakowski). They take an expense-paid trip to Rock Vegas, but the evil Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson) has a plan to get rid of Fred so he can have Wilma for himself. That is about it for the near invisible plot. Once again the production values are high, but that does not save this film from being a dud. The casting is impressive, but there is nothing for the cast to work with. Basically the first film with a different situation and different actors in the key roles. 2 out of 5 stars.",sequel that is prequel that is not equal original,like its predecessor flintstones viva rock vegas tries be likeable however this film is not quite up par with original this version deals with way flintstones came into existence young dino crane operators fred flintstone mark addy barney rubble stephen baldwin find true love fast food waitresses wilma kristen johnston betty jane krakowski they take expense paid trip rock vegas but evil chip rockefeller thomas gibson has plan get rid fred so he can have wilma himself that is about it near invisible plot once again production values are high but that does not save this film being dud casting is impressive but there is nothing cast work with basically first film with different situation different actors key roles 2 out 5 stars,0.6170833333333333,0.144375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,Spectacular in the support,"I know a lot of people hate this movie and it's rated ridiculously low but it has always been a favourite of mine.Bright colours and goofy pre-historic puns make it easy for the whole family to watch, and if you have to get up to do something, you won't miss any crucial plot points.There may be some casting that you didn't like but Jane Krakowski is perfect as Betty and Alan Cumming is always perfect, he plays great as Great Gazoo AND Mick Jagged (""snag m. Even Joan Collins was outrageous as mother Slaghoople, but who else could bring glam to a time without modern techniques?? And, as reminder, she was a prequel version of Liz Taylor from the original. Special mention to Thomas Gibson as the handsome villain. I'm no movie producer or whatever but the sets looked mostly real, unlike most movies now filmed almost exclusively in warehouses, and the effects they do use are better than some I see now, 17 years later. Sure, if you look closely, the lighting is off or poor depth perspective on some of the fast-moving effects, but this was the show based on a cartoon style that repeated it's backgrounds while eyes and mouths basically had two positions, open and closed. The music is rompy and fun, classic style meet-cute and Vegas tunes. And who doesn't love an origin story? And I can't resist a Vegas movie. Hello? Ann Margrock seeing a stone-age Elvis cover? EPIC! Flintstones (this one and it's predecessor) are among the first of the live-action cartoon revivals, I cash cow that Disney is now suckling to.

3.0,Fossilized dino deposits,"This movie makes an awkward attempt to stay faithful to the spirit of the cartoon. It has moments, but far too few of them.The few things done right first: Jane Krakowski makes a wonderful Betty; why couldn't she have been in the first movie? She makes the silly dialog somehow sweet and fun. The dating sequence is cute and the Vegas arrival scene has some clever sight gags, but these were fleeting montages. Harvey Korman is wasted in a throw-away role with few lines; instead of voicing Gazoo (as he did in the original cartoon), and the guy they use for Gazoo sounds like slate grinding on bedrock.Joan Collins is obnoxious enough on her own; this movie has her play a wrenching stereotypical loudmouth mother-in-law who you want to feed to the nearest T-Rex you can find. And the guy that plays Barney? What the heck is he doing? His entire performance looked like a rejected audition for a junior high school production of ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure in Jurassic Park."" Fred? The guy had a voice almost as nasally as Joan Collins. Wilma is cast as a 7-foot-tall giraffe. Fred goes gambling: Gee, what's gonna happen there? Fred and Barney dress up as dancers: they even manage to ruin this classic comedy routine.

10.0,"***** A perfect 5 stars:An excellent underrated ""simple-gag"" comedy that slightly surpasses its original.","The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000) Directed by Brian Levant (Beethoven) Starring: Mark Addy (Full Monty), Stephen Baldwin (Fled), Kristen Johnston (3rd Rock from the Sun), Jane Krakowski (Ally McBeal),Thomas Gibson (Dharma & Greg), Alan Cumming (Goldeneye), Joan Collins (Dynasty), Harvey Korman (The Original Flintstones series) Featuring voices of: Mel Blanc (Jetsons the movie), Rosie O'Donell (The Flintstones) Rated PG: Light Adult Content, One swear word. (Yes, that can happen because that is the reason why the 1998 film ""Madeline"" got a PG rating) Genre(s): Family, Comedy, Romance, Based on a TV show (The Flintstones animated series of the 60's) Summary: It is basically a prequel of the 1994 underrated hit. (The Flintstones starring John Goodman). Fred (Addy) and Barney (Baldwin) just got their jobs in the rock quarry. Barney is feeling highly in content of his life although Fred is unsure of his future. Yet they'll meet ""The Great Gazoo"" (Cumming) for the 1st time soon enough. Meanwhile Wilma (Johnston) despite her financially wealthy life is feeling rather bored with her glamorous but rather humdrum life. After all she has her overbearing mother (Collins) her ex-boyfriend soon to be suitor for financial reasons of course Chip Rockefeller (Gibson) and who is trying to win Wilma's heart for financial reasons only, but at least she had her senile but good-hearted father (Korman). Wilma tries to escape her wealthy but unhappy life. So she runs away and gets a job at a local fifty-ish fast food place. Soon she meets with Betty (Krakowski) after trying to give a reason why she came there in the first place (but failing because Betty wouldn't let her completely explain) Betty gets Wilma a job at the fast food place. (Known as ""Bronto King"" gee try to guess what product plug in joke that was suppose to be.) Soon Fred and Barney meet the girls and you pretty much have an idea what's going on here.  The good: If it weren't for the fact that this was a prequel the casting would look downright absurd. (I mean c'mon a Baldwin Brother as Barney Rubble? I don't hate the Baldwins but still). The special effects are first rate. Yet despite the special effects and the gags this isn't just ""eye candy with simple gags"" the movie was well made as itself. The cast did well & the performances were well done too. Despite the fact that this is a PG film this is perfectly fine for the whole family. And I can easily recommend this to any Flintstone fan. (Although I am not a Flintstone fan, I did enjoy the show and the movies though). The animals were a really nice touch such as dino (Blanc) a massaging squid (O'Donell) and more. From start to finish this film plays out really well. Overall this is one of the best ""gag"" comedies I have seen for a while but so far the animation world is on a winning streak this year I hope the simple gag comedy world can do the same.

2.0,Truly Awful...I Had a Hard Time Watching it...,"""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is one of the poorest excuses for a family film I've seen in a long time.The original remake with John Goodman was at least decent, but this flop has not only an awful cast, but awful dialogue, filming techniques, jokes...it's straight out of a made-for-TV sequel. Only one thing: It's even worse.In this live-action prequel to the 1994 comedy hit, Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy) and wife Wilma (Kristen Johnston) go to Rock Vegas along with the Rubbles, Barney (Stephen Baldwin) and Betty (Jane Krakowski), where Wilma is pursued by playboy Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). This is the setup for a bunch of tiring gags that also have to do with a little green space alien coming to earth to see how humans mate, or something as such.This has to be one of the worst comedies I've seen it a while. It was actually painful for me to watch. There really are no redeeming values whatsoever, and I don't think I'd like it even if I was a five-year-old. It treats the audience like dirt, and it obviously seeing if there's any juice left in the audience to pay for another ""Flintstone"" flick.Instead of trying to improve upon the first film--which was a bit underrated--this film seems to go for the bare minimum in an effort only to draw money from the audience. I have to ask myself, if they knew the first was so critically-declaimed, why release another awful flick? Try to improve and get good reviews.But nope, no luck here. Instead we are treated to a truly awful and hard-to-watch comedy with no redeeming values whatsoever.Avoid at all costs.0.5/5 stars--John Ulmer",truly awful i had hard time watching it,flintstones viva rock vegas is one poorest excuses family film ive seen long time original remake with john goodman was at least decent but this flop has not only awful cast but awful dialogue filming techniques jokes its straight out made tv sequel only one thing its even worse this live action prequel 1994 comedy hit fred flintstone mark addy wife wilma kristen johnston go rock vegas along with rubbles barney stephen baldwin betty jane krakowski where wilma is pursued by playboy chip rockefeller thomas gibson this is setup bunch tiring gags that also have do with little green space alien coming earth see how humans mate or something as such this has be one worst comedies ive seen it while it was actually painful me watch there really are no redeeming values whatsoever i dont think id like it even if i was five year old it treats audience like dirt it obviously seeing if theres any juice left audience pay another flintstone flick instead trying improve upon first film which was bit underrated this film seems go bare minimum effort only draw money audience i have ask myself if they knew first was so critically declaimed why release another awful flick try improve get good reviews but nope no luck here instead we are treated truly awful hard watch comedy with no redeeming values whatsoever avoid at all costs 0 5 5 stars john ulmer,0.5976190476190476,-0.18979437229437232,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.28}"

This one had decent performances, really excellent art direction, and some really cool FX. I especially liked the Bronto-bridge and the Great Gazzoo. Unlike the first Flintstones, this prequel is smart, fun, and the actors truly become the characters they play. The story? LAME. The first 60% or so of the film DOES CLICK. But the rest, when they arrive in Rock Vegas, is pure dreck appealing to the lowest common denominator. But the film is so fun to look at, you really don't care.

,Mark Addy's Fred Flintstone is better than John Goodman's.,"I was surprised by this movie.I hated the original, I suppose because none of the cast of the original (except Elizabeth Perkins) resembled the Cartoon cast. I'll probably get stoned alive for saying this, but I didn't like John Goodman's Fred Flintstone. I think he played him awkwardly as though, he didn't really want to be in the movie.But Mark Addy was a lot lot better. OK, he didn't have the voice down to a tee, but he resembles Fred, when made up, a whole lot more than Mr. Goodman.I just wish they would have asked Elizabeth Perkins to re-create her role as Wilma. She did a great job in the original, and resembled and sounded like the cartoon character, where Kristen Johnston, didn't quite do it for me in the role. She looked far too mature to be playing Wilma, and didn't have the voice either. But full marks to Stephen Baldwin and Jane Krakowski as Barney and Betty. They were also a lot better than Rick Moranis and Rosie O'Donnell from the original film. Mostly because, again, they sounded like the cartoon characters and Krakowski resembled Betty. (Baldwin in no way looked like Barney though - oh, well, can't be perfect, but he makes up for it with the voice and laugh).Joan Collins is also hilarious in the film, as the Filthy Rich Mother of Wilma, and again, does a better job that Elizabeth Taylor from the original.Also watch out for Alan Cumming. He almost steals the film with his ""Mike Jagged"" from the Stones, while also playing an alien in a dual role.With great creatures (Jim Henson workshop), good gadgets and an all-round enjoyable film, I give this an 8 out of 10.",mark addys fred flintstone is better than john goodmans,i was surprised by this movie i hated original i suppose because none cast original except elizabeth perkins resembled cartoon cast ill probably get stoned alive saying this but i didnt like john goodmans fred flintstone i think he played him awkwardly as though he didnt really want be movie but mark addy was lot lot better ok he didnt have voice down tee but he resembles fred when made up whole lot more than mr goodman i just wish they would have asked elizabeth perkins re create her role as wilma she did great job original resembled sounded like cartoon character where kristen johnston didnt quite do it me role she looked far too mature be playing wilma didnt have voice either but full marks stephen baldwin jane krakowski as barney betty they were also lot better than rick moranis rosie odonnell original film mostly because again they sounded like cartoon characters krakowski resembled betty baldwin no way looked like barney though oh well cant be perfect but he makes up it with voice laugh joan collins is also hilarious film as filthy rich mother wilma again does better job that elizabeth taylor original also watch out alan cumming he almost steals film with his mike jagged stones while also playing alien dual role with great creatures jim henson workshop good gadgets all round enjoyable film i give this 8 out 10,0.6320261437908498,0.23807189542483662,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10.0,"a great, fun little movie","In reading a few of the negative reviews of this movie, I'm wondering if certain detractors actually even watched it. It's too easy for some people just to dis a flick because it is a sequel, or because it went straight to video, or because it's expected to be bad, or whatever. Don't let that happen with ""Viva Rock Vegas"": it is a fine little movie: fun, funny and visually rich in cartoony colors, costumes and sets. The acting (and voices) are top notch: Stephen Baldwin's ""Barney"" and Mark Addy's ""Fred"" are just fantastic; voices, mannerisms, etc. Jane Krackowski is spot on as Betty, (ditzy-ness and giggle-wise). Alan Cumming as ""The Great Gazoo"" is perfectly sarcastic and wise-ass. The CGI is very good, considering, as are the sets and costumes. The storyline makes sense, is plausible, and even engrossing (again, considering). For what it is, this is a great little movie, and compared to the first one (sheesh) it TOTALLY rocks (""rocks"". get it?).

6.0,"Unfairly hated, just like the first one","Since I grew up as a child in the 2000s I saw almost all the good movies based on classic cartoons (such as the GARFIELD ones, the SCOOBY DOO ones and of course THE FLINTSTONES ones). I must have seen the FLINTSTONES movies at least 3 times during my childhood and when I looked about them on IMDB I was shocked at their appalling scores (and this one has also made the new Bottom 100 at #87 at the moment as in 2018 the Bottom 100 changed the criteria for including movies in its list, so increasing the number of votes up to 10,000 for being eligible greatly impacted the list, and almost all of the movies in it are from the last 21 years.This film isn't really a sequel of the movie with John Goodman and Rick Moranis as apparently the studio had an hard time in calling back the actors for the previous movie so, for getting around this, this is a prequel about what happened before the events of the 1994 movie hit.In the beginning the alien Gazoo (Alan Cumming) is banished from his planet for some unknown mistakes and he has to go to Earth to follow the humans' mating rituals. Quite coincidentally, he picks as his subjects Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble (played this time by Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin) as they are freshly graduated and began to work in the quarry. After a while they meet Wilma Slaghoople and Betty Rubble (played this time by Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski) and they fall in love and they go on Rock Vegas, but soon trouble follows; Wilma comes from a rich and spoiled family and they are not really interested in low brow Fred; her former boyfriend Chip Rockfeller has a scheme for them when they go to the casino; after some misunderstanding Betty ends up in Mick Jagged's tour.So it really deserves its bad score and reviews? I don't think so. While the movie isn't a masterpiece it's good in what it is... a live action version of a cartoon. And despite having a different cast and a different story, I enjoyed it on the same level of the predecessor. It has the same colorful sets and funny looking dinosaurs and prehistoric animals from the first movie. The cast has improved a little bit; while Stephen Baldwin was a bit better than Rick Moranis in the first one as Moranis was less clueless, I prefer John Goodman over Mark Addy as Fred Flintstone. While Kristen Johnston is gorgeous just like Elizabeth Perkins (and even a bit taller), I think that Jane Krakowski was a cuter choice for Betty Rubble as she is less fat than Rosie O'Donnell. Thomas Gibson as the villain looked a LOT like Kyle MacLachlan for me.In substance, I'll simply suggest to don't be afraid to buck conventional wisdom, as this is a very cute and harmless family movie that can be enjoyed by both adults and children.",unfairly hated just like first one,since i grew up as child 2000s i saw almost all good movies based classic cartoons such as garfield ones scooby doo ones course flintstones ones i must have seen flintstones movies at least 3 times during my childhood when i looked about them imdb i was shocked at their appalling scores this one has also made new bottom 100 at at moment as 2018 bottom 100 changed criteria including movies its list so increasing number votes up 10 000 being eligible greatly impacted list almost all movies it are last 21 years this film isnt really sequel movie with john goodman rick moranis as apparently studio had hard time calling back actors previous movie so getting around this this is prequel about what happened before events 1994 movie hit beginning alien gazoo alan cumming is banished his planet some unknown mistakes he has go earth follow humans mating rituals quite coincidentally he picks as his subjects fred flintstone barney rubble played this time by mark addy stephen baldwin as they are freshly graduated began work quarry after while they meet wilma slaghoople betty rubble played this time by kristen johnston jane krakowski they fall love they go rock vegas but soon trouble follows wilma comes rich spoiled family they are not really interested low brow fred her former boyfriend chip rockfeller has scheme them when they go casino after some misunderstanding betty ends up mick jaggeds tour so it really deserves its bad score reviews i dont think so while movie isnt masterpiece its good what it is live action version cartoon despite having different cast different story i enjoyed it same level predecessor it has same colorful sets funny looking dinosaurs prehistoric animals first movie cast has improved little bit while stephen baldwin was bit better than rick moranis first one as moranis was less clueless i prefer john goodman over mark addy as fred flintstone while kristen johnston is gorgeous just like elizabeth perkins even bit taller i think that jane krakowski was cuter choice betty rubble as she is less fat than rosie odonnell thomas gibson as villain looked lot like kyle maclachlan me substance ill simply suggest dont be afraid buck conventional wisdom as this is very cute harmless family movie that can be enjoyed by both adults children,0.4752099567099565,0.053347402597402595,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
4.0,The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,"This prequel to the live action film based on the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon sitcom is just as cheesy and ridiculous, and yet it does have slightly more to offer, from the same director Brian Levant (Beethoven, Jingle All The Way). Basically The Great Gazoo (Alan Cumming) has come to Earth to see how humans (or should that be Neanderthals) mate, in his case, Fred Flintstone (A Knight's Tale's Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin). Soon enough Fred and Barney meet and fall in love with Wilma Slaghoople (Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me's Kristen Johnston) and Betty O'Shale (30 Rock's Jane Krakowski). Betty and Barney suit each other perfectly, but Wilma's mother Pearl (Joan Collins) is not impressed with Fred, she wants Wilma to marry rich bastard Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). Chip obviously plans to make Fred and Barney look like criminals by giving them some credit to gamble in Viva Rock Vegas, they obviously see the opportunity to make money to impress their girlfriends. In the end, Chip is obviously defeated, and Fred and Wilma marry, with Betty catching the flowers, oh, and Gazoo (who only Fred and Barney could see) succeeded in his ""mission"". Also starring Cumming as Mick Jagged, Harvey Korman as Colonel Slaghoople, American Pie's John Cho as Parking Valet, The Mask's Jim Doughan as Dinosaur Confessor and Rosie O'Donnell as the voice of the Octopus Masseuse.

4.0,Even weaker than the mediocre 1994 movie,"I saw the 1994 live action ""Flintstones"" movie on video for the second time in 2000, about 4 ½ years after I first saw it, and thought it was great during my second viewing. That was shortly after this prequel, featuring a different cast, came to the silver screen, and I remember hearing about this film around that time. Since I was not nearly as impressed during my last couple viewings of 1994's ""The Flintstones"" (both many years after my second), I was in no hurry to see ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"", especially since I knew it had an even worse reputation than its predecessor. It's been over 2 ½ years since I last saw the first live action ""Flintstones"" effort, and I've finally seen this second one, which is unsurprisingly not good.The Great Gazoo is an alien who is sent to Earth by his species to learn about human mating rituals. Back on Earth, in the prehistoric town of Bedrock, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble are two best friends who are both in search of girlfriends. They are the first ones Gazoo sees after he lands on the planet, so he decides to follow them around, even though he annoys them. Meanwhile, a rich young woman named Wilma Slaghoople is fed up with the snobbish people around her, especially her mother, and runs away. She goes to a restaurant and meets a waitress named Betty O'Shale, and they quickly become friends. Fred and Barney go to this restaurant and meet the two women. Fred gets a date with Betty and Barney gets one with Wilma. When the four of them go out together, Fred and Barney end up swapping girlfriends, but both of them are successful with their romance. Both couples are invited by Chip Rockefeller, Wilma's rich and arrogant ex-boyfriend, to his resort in Rock Vegas, but what they don't realize is that this is just a cruel scheme for Chip to win Wilma back! The main problem with the 1994 film is that it simply isn't funny, and that's most certainly a major issue with this prequel as well. The only part of this film I couldn't keep a straight face while watching was the ""I'm ignoring you"" part. There's one memorably lame moment with a farting dinosaur, and most of the other gags are just mediocre. I was also not impressed with many of the performances here. Mark Addy may not be bad as Fred, and I guess Stephen Baldwin isn't that bad as Barney, though I definitely preferred Rick Moranis' portrayal of the character in the first film. These performances certainly aren't great, however, and I certainly didn't care for Kristen Johnston and Jane Krakowski as Wilma and Betty respectively. Also, Alan Cumming plays two characters, which are Gazoo and Mick Jagged (obviously based on real-life Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger), and both his performances fail, especially the former, I would say. At the beginning, showing Gazoo with other members of his species on a spaceship before he is sent to Earth, it already looks like this is going to be a very unfunny comedy movie, and unfortunately, that beginning sequence doesn't lie.The first live action film adaptation of ""The Flintstones"" was a critical failure but a box office success, whereas ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" was both a critical AND box office flop. After watching it, that doesn't surprise me. I can't really think of anything wrong with the 1994 release other than the absence of laughs, but I would say that REALLY brings it down if quality, since it is supposed to be a comedy. Just like its predecessor, this prequel failed to make me laugh even one time, but this second film of the two also has inferior cast performances, and maybe a slightly more boring plot as well (I'm not 100% sure about that, as it's been a while since I last watched the first film), which makes it even worse. I only found it a BIT worse than the 1994 film, and don't absolutely hate it like many others clearly do, but some could find it a LOT worse, including some of those who like the first film. If you don't like 1994's ""The Flintstones"", you probably wouldn't like this prequel. If you do like that movie, there's probably STILL a good chance you wouldn't like ""Viva Rock Vegas"".",even weaker than mediocre 1994 movie,i saw 1994 live action flintstones movie video second time 2000 about 4 years after i first saw it thought it was great during my second viewing that was shortly after this prequel featuring different cast came silver screen i remember hearing about this film around that time since i was not nearly as impressed during my last couple viewings 1994s flintstones both many years after my second i was no hurry see flintstones viva rock vegas especially since i knew it had even worse reputation than its predecessor its been over 2 years since i last saw first live action flintstones effort ive finally seen this second one which is unsurprisingly not good great gazoo is alien who is sent earth by his species learn about human mating rituals back earth prehistoric town bedrock fred flintstone barney rubble are two best friends who are both search girlfriends they are first ones gazoo sees after he lands planet so he decides follow them around even though he annoys them meanwhile rich young woman named wilma slaghoople is fed up with snobbish people around her especially her mother runs away she goes restaurant meets waitress named betty oshale they quickly become friends fred barney go this restaurant meet two women fred gets date with betty barney gets one with wilma when four them go out together fred barney end up swapping girlfriends but both them are successful with their romance both couples are invited by chip rockefeller wilmas rich arrogant ex boyfriend his resort rock vegas but what they dont realize is that this is just cruel scheme chip win wilma back main problem with 1994 film is that it simply isnt funny thats most certainly major issue with this prequel as well only part this film i couldnt keep straight face while watching was im ignoring you part theres one memorably lame moment with farting dinosaur most other gags are just mediocre i was also not impressed with many performances here mark addy may not be bad as fred i guess stephen baldwin isnt that bad as barney though i definitely preferred rick moranis portrayal character first film these performances certainly arent great however i certainly didnt care kristen johnston jane krakowski as wilma betty respectively also alan cumming plays two characters which are gazoo mick jagged obviously based real life rolling stones frontman mick jagger both his performances fail especially former i would say at beginning showing gazoo with other members his species spaceship before he is sent earth it already looks like this is going be very unfunny comedy movie unfortunately that beginning sequence doesnt lie first live action film adaptation flintstones was critical failure but box office success whereas flintstones viva rock vegas was both critical box office flop after watching it that doesnt surprise me i cant really think anything wrong with 1994 release other than absence laughs but i would say that really brings it down if quality since it is supposed be comedy just like its predecessor this prequel failed make me laugh even one time but this second film two also has inferior cast performances maybe slightly more boring plot as well im not 100 sure about that as its been while since i last watched first film which makes it even worse i only found it bit worse than 1994 film dont absolutely hate it like many others clearly do but some could find it lot worse including some those who like first film if you dont like 1994s flintstones you probably wouldnt like this prequel if you do like that movie theres probably still good chance you wouldnt like viva rock vegas,0.48406432748538025,0.038320422267790706,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.34}"
6.0,Lively Prequel,"Since most Hollywood 'family' films look like cartoons anyway these days this prequel to 'The Flintstones' (which wasn't much cop in the first place) with its saturated colours and hyperactive performances passes the time pleasantly enough (although the addition of a 'funny' little green alien played by Alan Cumming smacks of desperation).Mark Addy struggles gamely with an American accent, while Kristen Johnston is as usual charmingly ungainly costumed as Wilma; and it's fun to see Harvey Korman and Joan Collins as her parents whose daughter has married beneath herself.",lively prequel,since most hollywood family films look like cartoons anyway these days this prequel flintstones which wasnt much cop first place with its saturated colours hyperactive performances passes time pleasantly enough although addition funny little green alien played by alan cumming smacks desperation mark addy struggles gamely with american accent while kristen johnston is as usual charmingly ungainly costumed as wilma its fun see harvey korman joan collins as her parents whose daughter has married beneath herself,0.4455555555555556,0.0865909090909091,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.36}"
