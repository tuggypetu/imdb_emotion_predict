10.0,The Final Part of the Saga,"In Coruscant, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the Separatist General Grievous' spaceship and Anakin kills Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) with his light-saber after a fight; however Grievous escape from the Jedi. When they land on Coruscant, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) comes to tell Anakin that she is pregnant. Soon he has premonitions of his wife dying during the delivery. Palpatine requests that Anakin joins the Jedi Council against the will of the members but his is not promoted to Master and stays Padawan; further they ask him to spy Palpaline. Anakin is manipulated by Palpatine about the true intentions of the Jedi and is tempted to know the dark side of the Force that could be capable to save Padmé. Further Palpatine discloses that he is Sith Lord Darth Sidious. What will Anakin do?""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the final part of the saga initiated in 1977 by George Lucas. This episode is among the best ones and shows how Darth Vader was born. George Lucas in 1971, surprised the world with the cult ""THX-1138"". In 1973, another great movie: ""American Graffiti"". Then, in 1977, he directed the fantastic ""Star Wars"". Since this date, he basically dedicated his life only to the excellent Star Wars saga. With his potential, he could have contributed much more to the cinema industry.

9.0,"Epic, Emotional, and Powerful. George Lucas' Farewell to the Star Wars Saga is an Operatic Masterpiece of Blockbuster Cinema","The final entry in George Lucas' Star Wars saga, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is one, giant climax to arguably the most popular movie franchise in history. It's also the most riveting of the series; A movie of such visual and storytelling intensity that it makes our typical standards for summer entertainment seem trivial. Sith has wall-to-wall action and jaw-dropping special effects, yes. By all measures, Episode III is a grand success when it comes to giving the legions of Star Wars fans any and everything they could have hoped for after Darth Vader uttered the words ""We meet again"" in 1977. The beauty of Revenge of the Sith is that it earns much more than diverting summer thrills. Strip away all the baggage that comes with the name 'Star Wars' and what you are left with is one of the most enthralling films of 2005.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith serves as a bridge to the first Star Wars, A New Hope, where we see the culmination of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the Dark Side. This is where Darth Vader is born. In addition to finally delivering on the promise of the entire prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith also has the gargantuan task of telling the story of how the Clone Wars ended, how an evil Empire emerged from a democratic Republic, and how Luke, Leia, Obi-Wan, and the rest found themselves where they are at the start of the original Star Wars movie. With all these massive story lines, it's a wonder that Lucas manages to squeeze the best out of every plot line, without straying from the film's most important element, Anakin's seduction by Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine. After having a vision of his wife, Padme, dying in childbirth, Jedi prodigy Anakin Skywalker consults with the chancellor, who expertly influences the young Jedi into turning to the dark side of the force. The entire seduction works brilliantly. With the seeds of Anakin's tragic flaw planted way back in The Phantom Menace, and expanded upon in Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith is free to focus on the straw that broke the camel's back. Anakin's desperation to save Padme's life makes his eventual turn believable, and Ian McDiarmid and Hayden Christensen both do well portraying an icy relationship that turns into a destructive mentorship. Anakin's final fall, framed alongside the rise of the Empire is a storytelling masterclass. Palpatine's seduction is subtle, yet dramatic, and the numerous loose ends from the originals are all tied with a certain kind of poetry. For all his writing deficiencies, Lucas spins this fable elegantly, with a delicacy that makes you realize, he's been dreaming of telling this story for a long, long time. The plot marches relentlessly forward with commanding momentum, but it is only one side of Revenge of the Sith. The special effects and action are in a class of their own. Episode III is the biggest of all the Star Wars movies in terms of story, and the visual effects return the favor. Once again, Lucas and company revel in all kinds of wide, sweeping shots of new worlds such as the lava fields of Mustafar or the city-sized sinkholes of Utapau. It's all part of a grand, dramatic style of filmmaking that makes Revenge of the Sith look like a finale, through and through. It's also remarkable how certain elements like the ships, soldiers, and costumes seamlessly blend into what is seen in the originals. As sophisticated as the effects are, its George Lucas and his painterly talent for composition that propel the effects from technically well done exercises of CGI and miniatures to truly beautiful cinematic images. Lost in all this is the action. The film begins with an old-fashioned space battle on an epic scale. It's a feast for the eyes, and it feels distinctly like classic Star Wars. The lightsaber duels, the lizard versus mono-wheel chase scene (which includes the villain General Grievous; a half droid, half alien, wheezing wonder of imagination and digital wizardry), and the Clone War battles are dazzling on levels rarely seen in traditional summer blockbusters. The final duel between Obi-Wan and a newly christened Darth Vader is operatic and straight-up Shakespearian in its emotional complexity. Along with the Order 66 montage, the action of the last half of Revenge of the Sith is as powerful as anything in the series.As with any movie, there are things in Episode III that could be criticized. The dialogue isn't dramatically better than it was in the previous two movies, and the acting can be wonky at times, but none of this amounts to anything in the grand scheme of things. In the end, Sith does so much right that complaining about a line or two that was corny or delivered awkwardly is an utter waste of time. The finale to the Star Wars saga aims so high and nails so many key notes, that its minor flaws are almost completely inconsequential. Revenge of the Sith is one of the boldest works of blockbuster filmmaking ever made. I can't name another tentpole franchise movie that comes close to the level of operatic emotional poignancy that marks the best moments of Episode III of the Star Wars Saga. Movies like this don't come around often. A New Hope is still the Star Wars movie we will cherish most, but in its boundless ambition and breathtaking power, Revenge of the Sith is high art in the form of a summer blockbuster. George Lucas puts every idea he's had about good vs evil, fathers and sons, and the rise and fall of empires into this masterpiece of popular entertainment. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a brilliantly crafted epic, one that cements George Lucas' Star Wars Saga as one of the great achievements in filmmaking history.92/100",epic emotional

9.0,This one is actually great!,"The first two movies in the prequel trilogy weren't horrible, but had so many flaws. This one isn't as good as any movie in the original trilogy, but if you ask me it's pretty close. This one is actually very well done and special effects don't look so fake now and give us some really epic scenes, especially in a movie's climax that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Here, George Lucas proved that he can still do it and I was really satisfied with this movie. The acting was the best the prequel trilogy gave and Hayden Christensen isn't so wooden and annoying anymore. Here he's actually pretty cool and shows that he has potential, but Ewan McGregor remains the best part of the cast. You really believe him to be young Obi-Wan and that's very well done and he also has some very heartbreaking moments with Anakin at the end. One of the biggest flaws in the prequels was all those political conversations. Just lots and lots and lots of talking that makes you want to fall asleep, but thankfully, Lucas listened to his fans and it's reduced here. It's still present, of course, but not as much. Romance between Padme and Anakin is a little bit more believable here, but still not enough and that's one of the biggest flaws here, but the blame is more on Attack of the Clones in this case. Everything is executed very well and leading up to the original trilogy is very good, even tho it does create some plot holes, but in Star Wars you can explain almost everything with the Force. And one more good thing for Jar Jar haters, he appears for only like, a second. Hooray! But there is one more thing they messed up in the ending and I'm not gonna spoil anything but that one awful line (NOOOO!). While the first two movies in the prequel trilogy were disappointing, this one makes it all better. Not everyone will like it, but as a big Star Wars fan, I must say it's a nice and intense ending for the prequels.",this one is actually great,first two movies prequel trilogy werent horrible but had so many flaws this one isnt as good as any movie original trilogy but if you ask me its pretty close this one is actually very well done special effects dont look so fake now give us some really epic scenes especially movies climax that will keep you at edge your seat here george lucas proved that he can still do it i was really satisfied with this movie acting was best prequel trilogy gave hayden christensen isnt so wooden annoying anymore here hes actually pretty cool shows that he has potential but ewan mcgregor remains best part cast you really believe him be young obi wan thats very well done he also has some very heartbreaking moments with anakin at end one biggest flaws prequels was all those political conversations just lots lots lots talking that makes you want fall asleep but thankfully lucas listened his fans its reduced here its still present course but not as much romance between padme anakin is little bit more believable here but still not enough thats one biggest flaws here but blame is more attack clones this case everything is executed very well leading up original trilogy is very good even tho it does create some plot holes but star wars you can explain almost everything with force one more good thing jar jar haters he appears only like second hooray but there is one more thing they messed up ending im not gonna spoil anything but that one awful line noooo while first two movies prequel trilogy were disappointing this one makes it all better not everyone will like it but as big star wars fan i must say its nice intense ending prequels,0.5422060252672498,0.1934620991253644,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10.0,"""Revenge is a dish best served cold.""","And so, the Star Wars saga comes full circle, with the final pieces of the intergalactic puzzle falling into place. Of course we knew the major elements about to be revealed, but to see it done so effectively is a tribute to the epic story telling genius of creator George Lucas.I recall the controversy about the working name of Star Wars Episode VI - Revenge of the Jedi. Back in 1983 it was thought that the title suggested too much violence, and not a fitting description for the forces of the ""good"" side. But for this installment of the series, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is certainly fitting, as Anakin Skywalker's turn to the Dark Side under his master Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious is fraught with betrayal, violence and murder.The movie opens with the same grand scope as previous films in the series, but taken to even more cosmic proportion with jaw dropping sequences of outer space grandeur. Fleet cruisers jet by gigantic space stations as naturally as city traffic. Fans of space opera will no doubt thrill to the spectacle of color and sound offered here.The relationship between Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is handled intelligently, even as the young Jedi is manipulated and convinced by Palpatine that the future of the Republic belongs in his own capable hands as dictator of the galaxy. Padme's refusal to side with her husband is of course the turning point in the marriage, with the safety of her newborns of uppermost importance. I guess what bothers me most about the movie though is the reason given for Padme's death during childbirth, having lost her will to live. This is not the character we saw in the prior two films; after all, she had the regal bearing and demeanor of a queen, and the shrewd tenacity of a planetary senator. To just ""give up"", even under the horrendous circumstances of Anakin's turn is a situation not adequately dealt with in the movie.General Grievous - great name for the robotic leader of the clone army, but what's with the persistent cough. Perhaps it made him seem more vile, but why would a robot suffer a human malady? His running battle with Obi Wan Kenobi was a highlight of the movie.Christopher Lee - now there's an actor who's first film credit dates back to 1948, and who's come a long way from the horror remakes of the 1950's and 60's, to star in the two major epic movie sagas of our time - ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, and episodes II and III of the current Star Wars series. It seems he only gets better with age, as his portrayal of Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus shows.Ewan McGregor does an excellent job of preparing us for the Alec Guiness version of the Jedi Master of ""Star Wars: A New Hope"". When he appears in the latter part of the film in the straw colored robe, I immediately thought of the scene in Episode IV when Princess Leia's hologram image reaches out for ""Obi Wan Kenobi - you're my only hope"".Following the death of Jedi Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), Darth Sidious gives the command to wipe out all the rest of the Jedi Council. Was it intentional, or merely coincidental, that the orders were carried out in the fashion of a sci-fi ""Godfather""? Only Obi Wan and Yoda had the wisdom and foresight to condemn themselves to exile so they could fight another day. Kenobi's mission to Tatooine to deliver the newborn Skywalker was a stroke of storytelling magic, bringing his personal adventure in the Star Wars saga full circle as well.But can the Star Wars story EVER end? The franchise lives on in a myriad of media, and it seems that there are even more adventures and characters whose stories must be told. One can only hope that the creativity and ingenuity begun by George Lucas in 1977 continues to live on in the hyper space region of entertainment known as The Star Wars Universe.",revenge is dish best served cold,so star wars saga comes full circle with final pieces intergalactic puzzle falling into place course we knew major elements about be revealed but see it done so effectively is tribute epic story telling genius creator george lucas i recall controversy about working name star wars episode vi revenge jedi back 1983 it was thought that title suggested too much violence not fitting description forces good side but this installment series revenge sith is certainly fitting as anakin skywalkers turn dark side under his master chancellor palpatine darth sidious is fraught with betrayal violence murder movie opens with same grand scope as previous films series but taken even more cosmic proportion with jaw dropping sequences outer space grandeur fleet cruisers jet by gigantic space stations as naturally as city traffic fans space opera will no doubt thrill spectacle color sound offered here relationship between padme amidala natalie portman anakin hayden christensen is handled intelligently even as young jedi is manipulated convinced by palpatine that future republic belongs his own capable hands as dictator galaxy padmes refusal side with her husband is course turning point marriage with safety her newborns uppermost importance i guess what bothers me most about movie though is reason given padmes death during childbirth having lost her will live this is not character we saw prior two films after all she had regal bearing demeanor queen shrewd tenacity planetary senator just give up even under horrendous circumstances anakins turn is situation not adequately dealt with movie general grievous great name robotic leader clone army but whats with persistent cough perhaps it made him seem more vile but why would robot suffer human malady his running battle with obi wan kenobi was highlight movie christopher lee now theres actor whos first film credit dates back 1948 whos come long way horror remakes 1950s 60s star two major epic movie sagas our time lord rings trilogy episodes ii iii current star wars series it seems he only gets better with age as his portrayal count dooku darth tyranus shows ewan mcgregor does excellent job preparing us alec guiness version jedi master star wars new hope when he appears latter part film straw colored robe i immediately thought scene episode iv when princess leias hologram image reaches out obi wan kenobi youre my only hope following death jedi mace windu samuel l jackson darth sidious gives command wipe out all rest jedi council was it intentional or merely coincidental that orders were carried out fashion sci fi godfather only obi wan yoda had wisdom foresight condemn themselves exile so they could fight another day kenobis mission tatooine deliver newborn skywalker was stroke storytelling magic bringing his personal adventure star wars saga full circle as well but can star wars story ever end franchise lives myriad media it seems that there are even more adventures characters whose stories must be told one can only hope that creativity ingenuity begun by george lucas 1977 continues live hyper space region entertainment known as star wars universe,0.49030825496342734,0.15259926854754446,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,This is war,"May 19, 2005 was not a simple day for fans and fans of the ""Star Wars"". It was a day when all pieces of history fell into place, finally opening a riddle that lasted more than 28 years. People imagined and thought out, wrote books and stories, collected facts and made legends, and everything for the sake of one saga, which will forever remain in the hearts of its admirers. Probably, almost every person, leaving the hall, could not convey or describe in words, what happened during these several hours in the cinema. Joyful, sad, tearful, shocked faces, slowly headed for the exit, promising to come back and see this episode again.This is the chapter of history, truly the most intense and the most powerful. It penetrates into the lungs, not allowing to breathe, touching hearts and souls. We are just spectators. But we can experience. And at some point, there is only a doomed sigh, realizing that there is no way out.Indeed, the third episode is the most cruel and tragic. There is much more pain and despair in it than in any other part. Here the republic collapses like a house of cards, turning into an empire, the Jedi perish at the hands of their ""single minded"", and the face of Anakin Skywalker forever hides the black helmet of Darth Vader. And all this inspires horror, the horror of hopelessness, when you slowly begin to understand that all this is only part of the plan, the way of a petty senator to a ruthless emperor, where everyone is just a pawn, in a huge game of the big world. And every word said accidentally becomes the key to this great puzzle, which accompanies the imperial march. But when you realize it, it's too late.""I swear the faithfulness of your teachings,"" whispers the future dark lord to his master with despair and devotion, asking only one thing - to save her beloved. At this moment Anakin Skywalker perishes, dies together with the republic, along with the Jedi, together with her beloved, giving birth to Darth Vader - the future tyrant, which inspires terror and fear, driven by hatred and despair, in the eyes of which something like love is reflected ... And the most terrible thing was that it was inevitable. The Jedi themselves dug themselves a pit, while the enemy stood behind them, alternately, pushing them down. This is war. Order 66. The army of clones. Padmé Anakin. Alone, these errors are not so significant, but together they form a whole madness and panic, in one hour destroying everything that the galaxy has been working on for many millennia. Therefore here the absolute evil and absolute good unite in the struggle, this cinema and consists of some contrasts. Good and bad, the Jedi and the Sith, Obi-Wan and Anakin, the emperor and Yoda, Anakin and Padmé.Such a controversial character went to Hayden Cristian. In essence, he plays two opposites in one body. Nobility and sincerity at the beginning and anger and hatred in the end. And all fear began, which slowly grew into panic, then into despair, anger, getting to hatred. It was thanks to fear that the emperor firmly grabbed Anakin's soul, not wanting to let go of his new servant. The glitter of embittered eyes, in which hatred for everything and the thirst for power breathe. It is difficult to imagine someone who could better cope with this task. Therefore, there are no more words left than one: ""I believe"".It's all over, Anakin. I'm above you!The battle of Obi-Wan and Skywalker is what remains in memory forever. This is not just a battle between two people who have spent together their whole lives, this is a battle between two brothers who sacrificed their lives for each other's sake. Here, the side and skills of each are determined. Obi-Wan (in the brilliant, by the way, performance of Evan McGregor) does not try to follow the easy ways to achieve his goals. He goes to Mustafar, he understands with bitterness what is going on. Therefore, this battle is not only with the darkness, it is a battle with yourself, with your feelings and attachments. Unlike Anakin, Obi-Wan is firmly committed to duty, goals, order. For some reason, he is sorry for the most in the end. A person who, in any situation, acted as correctly, and not as easily. At the same time, we see the battle of two other opposites. Yoda and the emperor. Here, the battle goes for other concepts, for democracy, peace and freedom. The fate of the entire galaxy is being decided. And as the swords are crossed, good and evil are constantly side by side, weaving and maintaining the balance of power, crossing swords, but achieving different goals.But where did it start? Padmé Amidala, without knowing it herself, is the center of the whole string and culmination that unfolds during these few hours. A tragic figure that unwittingly became the key to the empire, from which they simply got rid of unnecessarily. Natalie Portman, like no other, fits into a gloomy sweep and the helpless panic that reigns around. Her heroine is touching and ardent, but unable to change anything, she is only an outside observer of the war and the collapse of the republic.Painful and sad ...Most of the attention of the film is given to Anakin, whose fear and sweeping increasingly turns him into the ruler of the Sith. However, about the persecution of General Grievous, powerful battles and amazing planets, also did not forget. This is a movie that will not leave anyone indifferent. Yes, and whether to restrain feelings? After all, this legend, which will be remembered.Bravo George Lucas.The highest ball.",this is war,may 19 2005 was not simple day fans fans star wars it was day when all pieces history fell into place finally opening riddle that lasted more than 28 years people imagined thought out wrote books stories collected facts made legends everything sake one saga which will forever remain hearts its admirers probably almost every person leaving hall could not convey or describe words what happened during these several hours cinema joyful sad tearful shocked faces slowly headed exit promising come back see this episode again this is chapter history truly most intense most powerful it penetrates into lungs not allowing breathe touching hearts souls we are just spectators but we can experience at some point there is only doomed sigh realizing that there is no way out indeed third episode is most cruel tragic there is much more pain despair it than any other part here republic collapses like house cards turning into empire jedi perish at hands their single minded face anakin skywalker forever hides black helmet darth vader all this inspires horror horror hopelessness when you slowly begin understand that all this is only part plan way petty senator ruthless emperor where everyone is just pawn huge game big world every word said accidentally becomes key this great puzzle which accompanies imperial march but when you realize it its too late i swear faithfulness your teachings whispers future dark lord his master with despair devotion asking only one thing save her beloved at this moment anakin skywalker perishes dies together with republic along with jedi together with her beloved giving birth darth vader future tyrant which inspires terror fear driven by hatred despair eyes which something like love is reflected most terrible thing was that it was inevitable jedi themselves dug themselves pit while enemy stood behind them alternately pushing them down this is war order 66 army clones padm anakin alone these errors are not so significant but together they form whole madness panic one hour destroying everything that galaxy has been working many millennia therefore here absolute evil absolute good unite struggle this cinema consists some contrasts good bad jedi sith obi wan anakin emperor yoda anakin padm such controversial character went hayden cristian essence he plays two opposites one body nobility sincerity at beginning anger hatred end all fear began which slowly grew into panic then into despair anger getting hatred it was thanks fear that emperor firmly grabbed anakins soul not wanting let go his new servant glitter embittered eyes which hatred everything thirst power breathe it is difficult imagine someone who could better cope with this task therefore there are no more words left than one i believe its all over anakin im above you battle obi wan skywalker is what remains memory forever this is not just battle between two people who have spent together their whole lives this is battle between two brothers who sacrificed their lives each others sake here side skills each are determined obi wan brilliant by way performance evan mcgregor does not try follow easy ways achieve his goals he goes mustafar he understands with bitterness what is going therefore this battle is not only with darkness it is battle with yourself with your feelings attachments unlike anakin obi wan is firmly committed duty goals order some reason he is sorry most end person who any situation acted as correctly not as easily at same time we see battle two other opposites yoda emperor here battle goes other concepts democracy peace freedom fate entire galaxy is being decided as swords are crossed good evil are constantly side by side weaving maintaining balance power crossing swords but achieving different goals but where did it start padm amidala without knowing it herself is center whole string culmination that unfolds during these few hours tragic figure that unwittingly became key empire which they simply got rid unnecessarily natalie portman like no other fits into gloomy sweep helpless panic that reigns around her heroine is touching ardent but unable change anything she is only outside observer war collapse republic painful sad most attention film is given anakin whose fear sweeping increasingly turns him into ruler sith however about persecution general grievous powerful battles amazing planets also did not forget this is movie that will not leave anyone indifferent yes whether restrain feelings after all this legend which will be remembered bravo george lucas highest ball,0.5632118919502096,-0.02020050302760583,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.33}"

From jaw dropping lightsaber duels to great story telling it has it all!

Palpatines mischievous yet cunning way of turning anakin to the dark side of the force (did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise?).

10.0,"Without Prequels, I Wouldn't Even Care About Star Wars","I love the whole saga and by that i mean all 6 original movies. Rogue One was okay at best, but sequels completely made me lost interest in SW.Even tho i like all 6 movies, prequels are the main reason i got interested in SW universe at all. Sure episode II doesn't hold up well, but overall Phantom Menace had lots of great moments and music. Lightsaber duel between Obi Wan/Qui-Gon Jinn vs Darth Maul was absolutely amazing. Visuals in that whole fight scene, still hold up pretty well.But Revenge of the Sith was simply something else. This is actually good movie. This is not movie where i need to point out some cool stuff that i liked, no, i like almost everything in this movie. 2005 Visuals hold up surprisingly well, duel at the end is absolutely phenomenal and easily best lightsaber duel in whole series.It's absolutely ridiculous to see some older people still hating prequels and at the same time claiming that they are huge Star Wars fans. I'm sorry to break it to you, but no, you are not huge star wars fan, if you hate over half the lore. By the way Originals were never that perfect either, they have lots of goofy moments and to me that is okay, but it's absolute hypocrisy when some of these people hate prequels and then act like Originals are some kind of gold standard for movie making.Anyway, i'm extremely hyped for Obi Wan show, i'm very happy that one of my favorite SW characters, Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by great actor Ewan McGregor is finally back! This is amazing. I'm also happy that Hayden Christensen is back, because he was solid in Episode III.From the moment ""Duel of the Fates"" started playing, it was clear to me that this show is made for people who liked prequels and this is just amazing. Finally they are brining back stuff that i truly loved about Star Wars. Like i said, i like all 6 original movies and Mandalorian was great show, but this upcoming Obi Wan show means so much more to me, than for example Mandalorian or Boba Fett.",without prequels i wouldnt even care about star wars,i love whole saga by that i mean all 6 original movies rogue one was okay at best but sequels completely made me lost interest sw even tho i like all 6 movies prequels are main reason i got interested sw universe at all sure episode ii doesnt hold up well but overall phantom menace had lots great moments music lightsaber duel between obi wan qui gon jinn vs darth maul was absolutely amazing visuals that whole fight scene still hold up pretty well but revenge sith was simply something else this is actually good movie this is not movie where i need point out some cool stuff that i liked no i like almost everything this movie 2005 visuals hold up surprisingly well duel at end is absolutely phenomenal easily best lightsaber duel whole series its absolutely ridiculous see some older people still hating prequels at same time claiming that they are huge star wars fans im sorry break it you but no you are not huge star wars fan if you hate over half lore by way originals were never that perfect either they have lots goofy moments me that is okay but its absolute hypocrisy when some these people hate prequels then act like originals are some kind gold standard movie making anyway im extremely hyped obi wan show im very happy that one my favorite sw characters obi wan kenobi played by great actor ewan mcgregor is finally back this is amazing im also happy that hayden christensen is back because he was solid episode iii moment duel fates started playing it was clear me that this show is made people who liked prequels this is just amazing finally they are brining back stuff that i truly loved about star wars like i said i like all 6 original movies mandalorian was great show but this upcoming obi wan show means so much more me than example mandalorian or boba fett,0.5879199735449734,0.26993055555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.28}"

7.0,Best of the Star Wars trilogy of prequels...,".. and that's not saying that much. I think everyone judges every Star Wars movie by what is considered the best of the batch, the original Star Wars of 1977 and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of 1980. Compared with those movies, this movie is not so great. Compared to the other two prequels, it is the best of the three. It turns away from the tortuous details of Senate politics that infected its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"", and tries to get back to the action, relationships, and moral dilemmas that are at the heart of the ""Star Wars"" series. However, this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more of a conscientious effort by creator, director, and writer George Lucas.It basically forms a straight line, plot-wise, from Episode Two to Episode Four with no surprises and little character development, and depends upon what you already know about the entire Star Wars mythology to invest you in this movie and its characters rather than the action and dialogue of this one particular film. Also, there is little use made of either Natalie Portman's Padme Amidala - who actually has very little screen time - or the excellent Samuel L. Jackson, who is completely wasted given the small part that his character has in this film. Why employ such a great actor if you are going to give him lines that any extra could deliver? Additionally, for someone who has spent the last ten or fifteen years learning and living the ways of the Jedi, Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker seems to have very little inner turmoil making a sudden and complete transformation from protector of innocents to the apprentice of evil. He irrationally uses his desire to ensure his wife's safety - when there is no perceivable threat to her health other than his own premonitions - as an excuse to savage anyone who might get in his way and even some who couldn't if they wanted to, such as the ""younglings"" that he slaughters in the Jedi temple at Palpatine's behest. Thus the so-called transformation into Darth Vader is more like the flipping of a switch - more binary than analog.The best performance is that of Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine/""The Emporer"". He has a serpentine smoothness about him as he subtly plants doubts in Skywalker's mind about who is really on the side of evil while deftly handling all of the warring factions of the Republic so that people will actually be grateful when he takes complete power.In summary, if you have seen all of the other Star Wars films you will probably enjoy this one because it fills in all of the gaps and answers all of the remaining questions. However, with some more effort in the direction and writing, those questions could have been answered with much better dialogue and characters that were more three-dimensional.",best star wars trilogy prequels,thats not saying that much i think everyone judges every star wars movie by what is considered best batch original star wars 1977 empire strikes back 1980 compared with those movies this movie is not so great compared other two prequels it is best three it turns away tortuous details senate politics that infected its predecessor attack clones tries get back action relationships moral dilemmas that are at heart star wars series however this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more conscientious effort by creator director writer george lucas it basically forms straight line plot wise episode two episode four with no surprises little character development depends upon what you already know about entire star wars mythology invest you this movie its characters rather than action dialogue this one particular film also there is little use made either natalie portmans padme amidala who actually has very little screen time or excellent samuel l jackson who is completely wasted given small part that his character has this film why employ such great actor if you are going give him lines that any extra could deliver additionally someone who has spent last ten or fifteen years learning living ways jedi hayden christensens anakin skywalker seems have very little inner turmoil making sudden complete transformation protector innocents apprentice evil he irrationally uses his desire ensure his wifes safety when there is no perceivable threat her health other than his own premonitions as excuse savage anyone who might get his way even some who couldnt if they wanted such as younglings that he slaughters jedi temple at palpatines behest thus so called transformation into darth vader is more like flipping switch more binary than analog best performance is that ian mcdiarmid as chancellor palpatine emporer he has serpentine smoothness about him as he subtly plants doubts skywalkers mind about who is really side evil while deftly handling all warring factions republic so that people will actually be grateful when he takes complete power summary if you have seen all other star wars films you will probably enjoy this one because it fills all gaps answers all remaining questions however with some more effort direction writing those questions could have been answered with much better dialogue characters that were more three dimensional,0.42121212121212115,0.1758333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,The best Star Wars movie in my opinion,"SCORE: 10/10A true masterpiece. Rewatching this I am almost at loss for words from how amazing this film is. I was just soaking it all in.This movie hits so unbelievably hard. Anakin v Obi-Wan is by far the best battle in all of Star Wars and it has the most epic music and visuals to go along with it. There were so many huge moments throughout this film that I almost lost count (no pun intended). It starts out with an epic battle between Count Dooku and Obi-Wan/Anakin to free the Chancelor. That is followed up by a final face off between Obi-Wan and General Grievous. Then we get to see when Anakin turns to the dark side during the battle between Mace Windu and Darth Sidious, where he helps Palpatine kill Mace Windu. As a result, Palpatine is able to execute Order 66 and the extermination of the Jedi began. Anakin then traveled to the Jedi Temple to kill the Younglings and made his way to Mustafar.The Battle on Mustafar was one of great meaning and passion. On one hand, we saw Anakin, the once young boy who was deemed to be the ""chosen one"" and had all the excitement of the world to become a Jedi Knight. And on the other hand we had Obi-Wan, a man who had lost his Master in battle, was trusted to train the young boy, and was caught in difficult situation of having to stop someone he loves from destroying themself and the rest of the galaxy. Anakin felt like he had been betrayed by the Jedi and was only concerned with saving Padmé from death, which fueled him to do unspeakable things. In the end, Obi-Wan defeats Anakin and we are given one of the most emotional scenes I have seen in any movie, driven by the amazing performances of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen. You can hear the hurt in Obi-Wan's voice when he tells Anakin that they were brothers and that he loved him. You could also hear the pain in Anakin's voice when he yells back ""I hate you"". One of the most powerful moments in all of cinema.The ending of this movie set up so much and I am so freaking excited for the Kenobi show. We got to see the birth of Dark Vader, Luke, and Leia, Padme's death, and Yoda telling Obi-Wan he will teach him a way to communicate with his old Master, Qui-Gon. Finally, we see the Death Star being built.",best star wars movie my opinion,score 10 10a true masterpiece rewatching this i am almost at loss words how amazing this film is i was just soaking it all this movie hits so unbelievably hard anakin v obi wan is by far best battle all star wars it has most epic music visuals go along with it there were so many huge moments throughout this film that i almost lost count no pun intended it starts out with epic battle between count dooku obi wan anakin free chancelor that is followed up by final face off between obi wan general grievous then we get see when anakin turns dark side during battle between mace windu darth sidious where he helps palpatine kill mace windu as result palpatine is able execute order 66 extermination jedi began anakin then traveled jedi temple kill younglings made his way mustafar battle mustafar was one great meaning passion one hand we saw anakin once young boy who was deemed be chosen one had all excitement world become jedi knight other hand we had obi wan man who had lost his master battle was trusted train young boy was caught difficult situation having stop someone he loves destroying themself rest galaxy anakin felt like he had been betrayed by jedi was only concerned with saving padm death which fueled him do unspeakable things end obi wan defeats anakin we are given one most emotional scenes i have seen any movie driven by amazing performances ewan mcgregor hayden christensen you can hear hurt obi wans voice when he tells anakin that they were brothers that he loved him you could also hear pain anakins voice when he yells back i hate you one most powerful moments all cinema ending this movie set up so much i am so freaking excited kenobi show we got see birth dark vader luke leia padmes death yoda telling obi wan he will teach him way communicate with his old master qui gon finally we see death star being built,0.542829457364341,0.1315891472868217,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,They Really Did Save The Best 'Til Last,"I was never one of the millions of Star Wars groupies. I enjoyed the films, except for Attack Of The Clones, but wasn't a huge fan. Having seen the first five, I eventually got around to checking out this last one, if for no other reason than curiosity. Wow, it changed my whole outlook.I cannot believe how impressed I was with this film, how well the writers wrapped up the whole saga and put all the pieces together. This was an excellent film, the best of the entire series. It inspired me to buy the latest DVD set which had the first three movies released and then reacquire the Clones film to complete my DVD collection of it.I'm writing this review months after seeing ""Sith."" so it's just a few general thoughts. I remember thinking, after watching the wild opening, that this was going to be another one of the modern-day action films with too much action....but it settled down and wasn't vastly overdone in that area, although it could have toned it down a bit. Better than the action or special effects was simply the way the writers tied everything up, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, and his son wound up being the hero ""Luke"" that we saw in those early episodes of the 1970s and 1980s. The special effects were, of course, top-notch. When you go back and see those early films you really see how far Hollywood has advanced in this area. I cannot imagine how many hours of work it took the put these storyboards and computer artwork in this film, there is so much detail. It's mind-boggling.I know a lot of fans of this series feared the writers would mess up the final but their fears were not realized: this was a super ending to a memorable saga that endured for almost 30 years amazing.",they really did save best til last,i was never one millions star wars groupies i enjoyed films except attack clones but wasnt huge fan having seen first five i eventually got around checking out this last one if no other reason than curiosity wow it changed my whole outlook i cannot believe how impressed i was with this film how well writers wrapped up whole saga put all pieces together this was excellent film best entire series it inspired me buy latest dvd set which had first three movies released then reacquire clones film complete my dvd collection it im writing this review months after seeing sith so its just few general thoughts i remember thinking after watching wild opening that this was going be another one modern day action films with too much action but it settled down wasnt vastly overdone that area although it could have toned it down bit better than action or special effects was simply way writers tied everything up how anakin skywalker became darth vader his son wound up being hero luke that we saw those early episodes 1970s 1980s special effects were course top notch when you go back see those early films you really see how far hollywood has advanced this area i cannot imagine how many hours work it took put these storyboards computer artwork this film there is so much detail its mind boggling i know lot fans this series feared writers would mess up final but their fears were not realized this was super ending memorable saga that endured almost 30 years amazing,0.4743357487922706,0.24943495514147676,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,A Nutshell Review: Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith,"To all the fans out there, it is time to rejoice. George Lucas has delivered in Revenge of the Sith. In my list of favourite Star Wars movie, it ranks up there with Empire Strikes Back in its emotional level, and action sequences.It's natural that this review contains no spoilers, as most of you would already know of the plot, and of the ending, since it leads to A New Hope, and given the countless slew of marketing techniques used to promote this movie.But the question is, what actually pushes Anakin Skywalker to the Dark Side. And this is the crux of the movie - if the delivery or narrative is poor and unconvincing, then this movie will sink. Fortunately, Revenge cuts to the chase, and to the point, elaborating without being boring, pacing kept consistent with breathtaking action in between serious dialogue.The best scenes in this movie is however, not the action. They are each time Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker share a scene. After all, this movie is about the Sith, and every time these two are together, there is an ominous sign hanging that Anakin gets closer to the Dark Side, waiting for the inevitable to happen. If you're with Palpatine, I'd bet you will be smittened by his subtle sweet talk of power. George has written all these scenes well, and you really feel the seduction.But what really hit the spot was Hayden Christensen's performance. He brought out fear in Padme's death in his nightmares (which was actually a self fulfilling prophecy), arrogance of his knowing his Jedi powers being improved and unmatched, confusion of his dilemma of being in a corner, torn between the Jedi Order he belongs to and his confidante Palpatine. You feel Anakin's sadness and loss each time he makes a mistake when doing evil deeds - you feel his tears, every time he is torn in a world of political plotting, of being an unwilling double agent.Which makes me ponder, being a child prodigy Anakin Skywalker is, it is without proper supervision that he is being seduced by false promises of unlimited Dark power. Yoda gets sent off for a mission, so does Obiwan, leaving Mace Windu (who doesn't like Anakin, and vice versa) looking after him. It is precisely this opportunity that Palpatine gets closer and pushes Anakin over the edge. In a way, the Jedi's arrogance (or probably Mace's) caused their downfall, and Anakin's love for Padme being the fuel that Palpatine openly exploits.The Jedi Massacre, though short, is extremely painful to watch. You see the Jedis trying their utmost to survive in their respective war zones, yet being murdered in cold blood by hordes of ""friendly fire"" - Order 66. It is a sense of great loss and pity, and you'll be holding your breath to see how Yoda survives.And yes, the lightsabre battles - this film sees the most duels in the series. Obi-wan and Anakin vs Count Dooku, Obi-wan vs General Grievious, Mace Windu vs Palpatine, Yoda vs Palpatine, and finally, Obi-wan vs Anakin. Amongst them, I would rank Obi-wan vs General Grievious the weakest of them all, despite the boast that Grievious can weld 4 sabres and fight with them simultaneously. The ones which packs a punch, are Mace vs Palpatine - the battle between the Jedi's best in the lightsabre swordsmanship, and the power of the Dark Side, Yoda vs Palpatine - masters of the Light and Dark side dueling, with one of them admitting failure and loss, and finally, the battle amongst brothers, Obi-wan vs Anakin. I like this one the most, as the speed and red fiery environment they do battle in, really bring out the blue glow of their lightsabres as they duke it out in fantastic speed. The only time when sabres of the same colour clash, and the best.Fan favourites like R2D2 (don't we love this droid!) and even Chewbacca make appearances. Jar Jar Binks too, but without dialogue. C3PO however, got limited screen time. My only gripe, if any, will be Padme being reduced to Tears - from the tough cookie she is in the prequels, probably being an expectant mother has mellowed her a lot, and she is always so sad when she comes on screen.John Williams, there seems to be no wrong he can do with his score, as his Battle of the Heroes track highlights the fight between good and evil, between the surviving Jedis and the emergence of Sith power.I would be watching this movie again, to take in the fantastic seduction scenes of the Dark Side, the sense of loss, helplessness and confusion, and the agony of betrayal from those whom you trust. Powerful themes brought out in a tribute finale to the entire series, a fitting film that bridges the past films to the Original Trilogy loved by many.May the Force be with you.",nutshell review star wars episode iii revenge sith,all fans out there it is time rejoice george lucas has delivered revenge sith my list favourite star wars movie it ranks up there with empire strikes back its emotional level action sequences its natural that this review contains no spoilers as most you would already know plot ending since it leads new hope given countless slew marketing techniques used promote this movie but question is what actually pushes anakin skywalker dark side this is crux movie if delivery or narrative is poor unconvincing then this movie will sink fortunately revenge cuts chase point elaborating without being boring pacing kept consistent with breathtaking action between serious dialogue best scenes this movie is however not action they are each time supreme chancellor palpatine anakin skywalker share scene after all this movie is about sith every time these two are together there is ominous sign hanging that anakin gets closer dark side waiting inevitable happen if youre with palpatine id bet you will be smittened by his subtle sweet talk power george has written all these scenes well you really feel seduction but what really hit spot was hayden christensens performance he brought out fear padmes death his nightmares which was actually self fulfilling prophecy arrogance his knowing his jedi powers being improved unmatched confusion his dilemma being corner torn between jedi order he belongs his confidante palpatine you feel anakins sadness loss each time he makes mistake when doing evil deeds you feel his tears every time he is torn world political plotting being unwilling double agent which makes me ponder being child prodigy anakin skywalker is it is without proper supervision that he is being seduced by false promises unlimited dark power yoda gets sent off mission so does obiwan leaving mace windu who doesnt like anakin vice versa looking after him it is precisely this opportunity that palpatine gets closer pushes anakin over edge way jedis arrogance or probably maces caused their downfall anakins love padme being fuel that palpatine openly exploits jedi massacre though short is extremely painful watch you see jedis trying their utmost survive their respective war zones yet being murdered cold blood by hordes friendly fire order 66 it is sense great loss pity youll be holding your breath see how yoda survives yes lightsabre battles this film sees most duels series obi wan anakin vs count dooku obi wan vs general grievious mace windu vs palpatine yoda vs palpatine finally obi wan vs anakin amongst them i would rank obi wan vs general grievious weakest them all despite boast that grievious can weld 4 sabres fight with them simultaneously ones which packs punch are mace vs palpatine battle between jedis best lightsabre swordsmanship power dark side yoda vs palpatine masters light dark side dueling with one them admitting failure loss finally battle amongst brothers obi wan vs anakin i like this one most as speed red fiery environment they do battle really bring out blue glow their lightsabres as they duke it out fantastic speed only time when sabres same colour clash best fan favourites like r2d2 dont we love this droid even chewbacca make appearances jar jar binks too but without dialogue c3po however got limited screen time my only gripe if any will be padme being reduced tears tough cookie she is prequels probably being expectant mother has mellowed her lot she is always so sad when she comes screen john williams there seems be no wrong he can do with his score as his battle heroes track highlights fight between good evil between surviving jedis emergence sith power i would be watching this movie again take fantastic seduction scenes dark side sense loss helplessness confusion agony betrayal those whom you trust powerful themes brought out tribute finale entire series fitting film that bridges past films original trilogy loved by many may force be with you,0.498748812163446,0.05600869320381516,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,The saga is complete.,"Finally we have the episode3 of Star wars. So many things happens in this episode, that I need to make a summary of the things that happens. First of all, some years have passed since the Clone War. Anakin and Obi Wan are fighting as hard as they can, specially now that Palpatine was kidnapped by general Grievous, the leader of the droids army. Anakin finally menage to kill Count Dookan,( with Palpatine motivating him)and Obi Wan killed Gen. Grievous.Anakin continues to maintain the marriage with Padmé hidden, but things starts to become complicated to him when he starts to have nightmares with Padmé dying when she gave birth .Anakin becomes a sith and an apprentice from Darth Sidious, and even Padmé who could not believe that Anakin turned to be bad, is shocked by his behavior(as well as obi wan).Anakin's looks are much better then episode 2(he is more similar to Luke) and R2-D2 has more participations in this episode as the others.The clones executing order 66 has strong scenes, because seeing so many Jedis and Wookies being killed is heartbreaking for everybody who is a big fan of Star Wars.(specially when the little Jedi children are killed by Anakin's hands) This episode is the mark when the Empire begins and the Jedis fall. The only jedis alive are Yoda and Obi Wan, the first one stays isolated and the second one goes to Tatooine to give Luke to her uncle and to be watching him. (Leia and Luke are isolated from each other to be safe from the siths, and Leia stays with Senator Organa,who always wanted to adopt a little girl).We also can see Anakin's body being destroyed in the fire, and for that reason he cannot live without the black and famous suit of Darth Vader, that nowadays is an icon for every fan.Padmé only died because she gave up of living, since Anaking broke her heart. (By the way, she only dies because of Anakin himself) In his desire to make PAdmé alive, he went to the dark side and this is what makes her sad and heartbroke.(Palpatine,who is lord sidious tempted him with the offer of knowing how to produce life, and Anaking, being too much an ambitious person and angry with the jedi council that not trust him very much, became a sith.R2 and CP3O has their memory erased, that's why they don't remember anything and never told Luke about his father.*A Thing that I really don't like: 1-First, I personally think that Anakin surrendered too easily for the dark side, specially for someone who was full of doubts all the time. But in general, this the best episode from the new trilogy.",saga is complete,finally we have episode3 star wars so many things happens this episode that i need make summary things that happens first all some years have passed since clone war anakin obi wan are fighting as hard as they can specially now that palpatine was kidnapped by general grievous leader droids army anakin finally menage kill count dookan with palpatine motivating him obi wan killed gen grievous anakin continues maintain marriage with padm hidden but things starts become complicated him when he starts have nightmares with padm dying when she gave birth anakin becomes sith apprentice darth sidious even padm who could not believe that anakin turned be bad is shocked by his behavior as well as obi wan anakins looks are much better then episode 2 he is more similar luke r2 d2 has more participations this episode as others clones executing order 66 has strong scenes because seeing so many jedis wookies being killed is heartbreaking everybody who is big fan star wars specially when little jedi children are killed by anakins hands this episode is mark when empire begins jedis fall only jedis alive are yoda obi wan first one stays isolated second one goes tatooine give luke her uncle be watching him leia luke are isolated each other be safe siths leia stays with senator organa who always wanted adopt little girl we also can see anakins body being destroyed fire that reason he cannot live without black famous suit darth vader that nowadays is icon every fan padm only died because she gave up living since anaking broke her heart by way she only dies because anakin himself his desire make padm alive he went dark side this is what makes her sad heartbroke palpatine who is lord sidious tempted him with offer knowing how produce life anaking being too much ambitious person angry with jedi council that not trust him very much became sith r2 cp3o has their memory erased thats why they dont remember anything never told luke about his father thing that i really dont like 1 first i personally think that anakin surrendered too easily dark side specially someone who was full doubts all time but general this best episode new trilogy,0.5089853421432369,0.02039454697349434,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.01, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Lucas Redeemed!,"When I asked the reviewer sitting next to me to sum up Revenge of the Sith, he simply said ""great!"" That seemed to basically be the consensus of virtually everyone in attendance at an advance press screening of the final chapter in the Star Wars saga.There was an exuberant mood leaving the theater, as if everyone was in collective agreement that Lucas had finally done it. That he had gone out on top, with a stunning, rock-solid coup de grace. And from all the feedback I've heard from that screening, my sense of that collective mood was right.There are no real spoilers in ROTS. Everyone basically knows what happens in Episode 4: A New Hope. We all know Anakin becomes Vader. We know Obi Wan lives and we know Luke and Leia are born. What we don't know is how Lucas weaves those story lines into the large, six-part opus and better yet, why?No, it's not a perfect movie. There are those moments that make us cringe. Bad dialog and High School drama class acting make for a few awkward moments where you can hear audible moans and giggles in the audience, but we have come to expect this from modern Star Wars films. The upside is that these moments are rare in Episode III. OK, get ready. Take a deep breath. No Jar Jar! Yes, you read that right. You can let out that deep breath now.Fortunately, we have one savior to rely on for stellar acting. Mr. Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. McDiarmid brings the elegance of an Alec Guiness back to the franchise in a knockout performance that leaves the audience riveted and exhausted. He is the lifeblood of the film.As someone who saw the original 30 times in it's first month of release at the age of 13, I currently consider myself a Star Wars moderate. I don't have volumes of SW merchandise, nor can I debate whether or not carbonite contains enough oxygen to make it float. All I know is that magical feeling Star Wars gave me in the original 1977 release and that I'm happy to say, after a disappointing pair of prequels, has been finally restored and reinvigorated.Here's to Mr. Lucas for giving us all something spectacular to remember for our entire lives that embodies the whole point of going to the movies in the first place, to escape and lose ourselves in another world.",lucas redeemed,when i asked reviewer sitting next me sum up revenge sith he simply said great that seemed basically be consensus virtually everyone attendance at advance press screening final chapter star wars saga there was exuberant mood leaving theater as if everyone was collective agreement that lucas had finally done it that he had gone out top with stunning rock solid coup de grace all feedback ive heard that screening my sense that collective mood was right there are no real spoilers rots everyone basically knows what happens episode 4 new hope we all know anakin becomes vader we know obi wan lives we know luke leia are born what we dont know is how lucas weaves those story lines into large six part opus better yet why no its not perfect movie there are those moments that make us cringe bad dialog high school drama class acting make few awkward moments where you can hear audible moans giggles audience but we have come expect this modern star wars films upside is that these moments are rare episode iii ok get ready take deep breath no jar jar yes you read that right you can let out that deep breath now fortunately we have one savior rely stellar acting mr ian mcdiarmid as supreme chancellor palpatine mcdiarmid brings elegance alec guiness back franchise knockout performance that leaves audience riveted exhausted he is lifeblood film as someone who saw original 30 times its first month release at age 13 i currently consider myself star wars moderate i dont have volumes sw merchandise nor can i debate whether or not carbonite contains enough oxygen make it float all i know is that magical feeling star wars gave me original 1977 release that im happy say after disappointing pair prequels has been finally restored reinvigorated heres mr lucas giving us all something spectacular remember our entire lives that embodies whole point going movies first place escape lose ourselves another world,0.5502132264898221,0.11344846642718982,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.36}"

8.0,Flawed but still great,"ROTS is my favourite of the live action Star Wars movies. Does that make it perfect? No. There's some bad dialogue (""It's only because I'm so in love"", ""No, it's because I'm so in love with you""), Sidious killed three Jedi Council Members far too easily and Dooku only had a cameo. However, unlike TFA, which was such a pitiful excuse for a Star Wars film that I think it wounded the franchise, ROTS can stand on its own and deserves its place in Star Wars canon.First of all, the hatred for Hayden Christiansen is very unfair. People keep insulting his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker but I think he actually did a good job with what he had to work with. He spoke in a monotone but he was playing a man who was taught to control his feelings. One of Anakin's character flaws is that he doesn't understand the difference between controlling your feelings and suppressing them. To me, Hayden's monotone showed that Anakin was suppressing his emotions which was partially responsible for his fall. I see it as a warning about how dangerous it can be to suppress your feelings without giving them some kind of outlet. Furthermore, Hayden's actually rather good at acting with his expressions and body language. For example, when he was alone on Mustafar after killing the Separatists he didn't have a single line, but the tear track running down his face showed that part of Vader hated what he'd become.Samuel L Jackson nailed the role of Mace Windu, particularly during his duel with Palpatine. The fight itself wasn't brilliant, particularly when Sidious killed the other three Jedi, but Samuel used some subtle gestures to make it work. For example, the biggest flaw in the fight, apart from the ignominious deaths of Agen Kolar, Saesee Tinn and Kit Fisto, was when Sidious held Mace at blade-point. One might wonder why he didn't strike Windu down then and there but to me, the way Windu spread his arms basically said ""come and have a go"", subtly undermining Sidious' confidence and causing him to hesitate. The confidence with which Mace held himself explains why Sidious didn't take advantage of the opening straight away. There's also that tiny gesture Mace gave to Anakin when he held Sidious at blade-point, subtly motioning for him to stand back. Mace also represents all the Jedi Order's flaws, making him an unlikable character despite Samuel's excellent portrayal of him. However, I think George Lucas had the right idea when he created a character who showed how corrupt and arrogant the Jedi had become and how they were partially responsible for their own destruction.Ewan McGregor did an excellent job as Obi-Wan Kenobi. I mean no disrespect to the late Alec Guinness who was great in the Original Trilogy, but I think Ewan surpassed him. He was certainly better at lightsaber duelling and also nailed Obi-Wan's calm, confident presence. For example, when he jumped into the middle of a group of battle droids to confront General Grievous, he just had to say ""Hello there"" to show he meant business. He was also great at conveying Obi-Wan's anguish after defeating Vader on Mastafar.Natalie Portman also did a great job as Padme, although the explanation for Padme's death was a bit weak, and Leia shouldn't have been able to remember her since she'd only just been born. Padme's most powerful line in the film was ""So this is how liberty dies... with thunderous applause"". ROTS, AOTC and TPM taught me not to trust politics and I think that although the political scenes were dull, they were essential for the story. I'm grateful that George Lucas warned me about the dangers of politics. I think the weakest part of the Prequels is Padme's romance with Anakin but Natalie and Hayden both did a very good job in the scene where Anakin found out that Padme was pregnant.Ian McDiarmid seemed to love being Darth Sidious. He could portray Sidious' subtle, calculating, manipulative side but when Sidious was able to use his powers openly, he absolutely loved it, behaving like a complete psycho. He was over-the-top when killing Mace and battling Yoda but he also did well in quieter moments.Christopher Lee only had a cameo, but in the short time he had, he BECAME Count Dooku. He nailed Dooku's arrogance but when he was on his knees in front of Anakin, you can see the fear in his eyes. General Grievous was a much weaker villain. In addition to being a coward, Grievous didn't stand a chance against Obi-Wan in lightsaber combat, although he did nearly kill him in hand to hand combat, albeit only because of his mechanical body.George Lucas isn't a great script writer but he possesses intelligence, creativity and passion and it clearly shows in this film. ROTS isn't a perfect film but I think the good things about it make up for its flaws.",flawed but still great,rots is my favourite live action star wars movies does that make it perfect no theres some bad dialogue its only because im so love no its because im so love with you sidious killed three jedi council members far too easily dooku only had cameo however unlike tfa which was such pitiful excuse star wars film that i think it wounded franchise rots can stand its own deserves its place star wars canon first all hatred hayden christiansen is very unfair people keep insulting his portrayal anakin skywalker but i think he actually did good job with what he had work with he spoke monotone but he was playing man who was taught control his feelings one anakins character flaws is that he doesnt understand difference between controlling your feelings suppressing them me haydens monotone showed that anakin was suppressing his emotions which was partially responsible his fall i see it as warning about how dangerous it can be suppress your feelings without giving them some kind outlet furthermore haydens actually rather good at acting with his expressions body language example when he was alone mustafar after killing separatists he didnt have single line but tear track running down his face showed that part vader hated what hed become samuel l jackson nailed role mace windu particularly during his duel with palpatine fight itself wasnt brilliant particularly when sidious killed other three jedi but samuel used some subtle gestures make it work example biggest flaw fight apart ignominious deaths agen kolar saesee tinn kit fisto was when sidious held mace at blade point one might wonder why he didnt strike windu down then there but me way windu spread his arms basically said come have go subtly undermining sidious confidence causing him hesitate confidence with which mace held himself explains why sidious didnt take advantage opening straight away theres also that tiny gesture mace gave anakin when he held sidious at blade point subtly motioning him stand back mace also represents all jedi orders flaws making him unlikable character despite samuels excellent portrayal him however i think george lucas had right idea when he created character who showed how corrupt arrogant jedi had become how they were partially responsible their own destruction ewan mcgregor did excellent job as obi wan kenobi i mean no disrespect late alec guinness who was great original trilogy but i think ewan surpassed him he was certainly better at lightsaber duelling also nailed obi wans calm confident presence example when he jumped into middle group battle droids confront general grievous he just had say hello there show he meant business he was also great at conveying obi wans anguish after defeating vader mastafar natalie portman also did great job as padme although explanation padmes death was bit weak leia shouldnt have been able remember her since shed only just been born padmes most powerful line film was so this is how liberty dies with thunderous applause rots aotc tpm taught me not trust politics i think that although political scenes were dull they were essential story im grateful that george lucas warned me about dangers politics i think weakest part prequels is padmes romance with anakin but natalie hayden both did very good job scene where anakin found out that padme was pregnant ian mcdiarmid seemed love being darth sidious he could portray sidious subtle calculating manipulative side but when sidious was able use his powers openly he absolutely loved it behaving like complete psycho he was over top when killing mace battling yoda but he also did well quieter moments christopher lee only had cameo but short time he had he became count dooku he nailed dookus arrogance but when he was his knees front anakin you can see fear his eyes general grievous was much weaker villain addition being coward grievous didnt stand chance against obi wan lightsaber combat although he did nearly kill him hand hand combat albeit only because his mechanical body george lucas isnt great script writer but he possesses intelligence creativity passion it clearly shows this film rots isnt perfect film but i think good things about it make up its flaws,0.5873549382716048,0.1315226471059804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
