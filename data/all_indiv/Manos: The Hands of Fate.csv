1.0,Your eyes and ears will BLEED!,"Some films are so bad, they're good. Meaning ""fun"" or ""entertaining"" or at least ""interesting""... But few films can claim to be so dreadful, you actually feel physical pain while viewing them. So bad are these damned few that you don't experience them or watch them: you ""endure"" them. This is the mother of all such films!""Manos the hands of fate"" is without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made. Its poorness is so extreme that of itself it is the film's strongest selling point. The script is non-existent, the acting makes Steven Seagal look like a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the editing could have been less horrendously botched by a blind Eskimo with no arms. It is also painfully slow. this film makes might barely last 70 minutes but you will feel like you've aged ten years by the end of it. That's what makes a film truly bad: the fact that despite its overbearing weaknesses it isn't even entertaining!Many people look back at the sixties and think, with obvious resentment for today's cinematic output, that ""they don't make them like this anymore!"". Watching ""Manos..."" would cure any breed of hardcore nostalgia.In the end I can not advise against this strongly enough. This is for the masochist in you (or the sadist if you insist on showing it to friends).

,Look no further--this is the worst,"Every so often, someone comes onto IMDb (or a similar forum) and declares that such-and-such a film is, and I quote, ""THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!"" Usually the culprit is the latest big-budget, little-story extravaganza, or some popular work receiving its expected share of backlash. I always laugh a bit when people do this. Clearly, these innocent souls have never seen an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" Specifically, they have never been exposed to the horror that is ""Manos: The Hands of Fate."" Sure, plenty of movies are bad, but usually if you look hard enough, you can see some evidence that someone on board had at least a vague idea of how to make a film work. Not ""Manos."" There is not a single shred of competence to be found anywhere in it. It fails on every conceivable level: direction, acting, script, cinematography, sets, costumes, effects, sound, music. Throw in some of the most irritating and idiotic characters you'll ever see, a lot of disturbing sexual subtext, and the result is this pile of cinematic excrement.The story...well, I guess it's supposed to be one of those ""innocents get lost and stumble upon supernatural evil"" deals. Actually, it's more like an ""irritating family gets lost and stumbles upon a group of vague cultists and their creepy hired hand Torgo"" deal. Anyway, things happen, arguments go in circles, the mom of the family yells for her husband so much you wonder how she ties her shoes in the morning without him, the husband makes so many wrong decisions you wonder if he'd be any help with the shoe-tying thing, and the female cultists get into an extended wrestling match, revealing that under their diaphanous Grecian robes they're wearing modern bras and underwear.There's much more, of course, but ""Manos"" is like a train wreck, or a natural disaster: I could describe it to you, but you'd never understand the full level of horror unless you witness it for yourself. So go ahead, watch it, I dare you. At least you can take comfort in the knowledge that, after you've seen it, nothing else you watch will be quite so bad.",look no further this is worst,every so often someone comes onto imdb or similar forum declares that such such film is i quote worst movie ever usually culprit is latest big budget little story extravaganza or some popular work receiving its expected share backlash i always laugh bit when people do this clearly these innocent souls have never seen episode mystery science theater 3000 specifically they have never been exposed horror that is manos hands fate sure plenty movies are bad but usually if you look hard enough you can see some evidence that someone board had at least vague idea how make film work not manos there is not single shred competence be found anywhere it it fails every conceivable level direction acting script cinematography sets costumes effects sound music throw some most irritating idiotic characters youll ever see lot disturbing sexual subtext result is this pile cinematic excrement story well i guess its supposed be one those innocents get lost stumble upon supernatural evil deals actually its more like irritating family gets lost stumbles upon group vague cultists their creepy hired hand torgo deal anyway things happen arguments go circles mom family yells her husband so much you wonder how she ties her shoes morning without him husband makes so many wrong decisions you wonder if hed be any help with shoe tying thing female cultists get into extended wrestling match revealing that under their diaphanous grecian robes theyre wearing modern bras underwear theres much more course but manos is like train wreck or natural disaster i could describe it you but youd never understand full level horror unless you witness it yourself so go ahead watch it i dare you at least you can take comfort knowledge that after youve seen it nothing else you watch will be quite so bad,0.5156059218559219,-0.08160485347985347,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.28}"
2.0,"A $300 refrigerator , and I am still waiting for the sequel","Upon release, Manos: The Hands of Fate swept theaters throughout the world, causing mass hysteria, panic, and power outages as theater-owners tried to keep up withe the endless demands for more power to power more projectors and sound equipment. Concerns for the general health of the world's population kept it shelved for several years, but now, finally, the greatest film of all time has been unleashed upon the public. With a score by John Coltrane and Frank Zappa (who also appears as ""The Master""), direction by Martin Coppolla (illegitimate son of Mr. Scorses and Francis Ford...), and a script written by Stephen King (at the age of 14), Manos is as legendary as it is brilliant.Not.There really is no sense in beating this poor film into the ground any more than it already has been. What I find sort of amusing is that after a third or fourth viewing (yes, I admit it, I'm a masochist), is that it's sort of grown on me a bit. Like a fungus!Manos is about a small family of yankees who get lost in the southwestern US and end up in a place from which nobody can leave, in an Inn overseen by a twitching human-goat hybrid named Torgo (who steals the show) and owned by the enigmatic ""Master"" - a worshipper of Manos who collects wives through trapping them at his inn. I guess you can figure the rest of the film out pretty easily. This ends up being a horror film with virtually no horror, an action film with the most poorly shot action sequences I've ever seen, and an artsy jazz vehicle with such poor acoustic sound quality that it would have been much better with just the groovy soundtrack and no dialog.The biggest problem with Manos is what we call ""Production values"". To cut to the chase, there are none.There is too much wrong with this film to list it all out, so instead I will list what's right with it. The acting is not entirely awful - but the sound, editing, pacing and camera work are so bad that the actors all look totally ridiculous at all times. The script is not the worst I've seen, but it is lost in the jerks and irks of the pace (dramamine recommended), and finally, the plot is no worse than some of the recent Hollywood horror catastrophes I have seen, but it to is swept up in the maelstrom of maleficence emanating from the director's chair.The result would make a great object example for a film production class in ""what not to do"". Most people will find this film tedious, idiotic, and unwatchable. The average person, I think will turn it off after the first 5 minutes of countryside pans during the opening driving scenes.Some would argue that my rating of 2 is too high. I won't argue that point but I will explain that I reserve ""1"" for those truly aggravating films which do more harm then good, serve no purpose, and do nothing to expand the boundaries of contemporary film-makers' and cinema-goers imaginations. Most of these are commercial Hollywood romantic and sex comedies and horror films. Manos, at least, occupies an important place in film-making history, and should really be seen by would-be film-makers and participants. At least it didn't cost much to make, and at least it does no real long lasting harm. Can't say the same for, for example, ""American Pie"". For these reasons, I reserve the rating ""1"" for such truly harmful films. The distinction is best made through an analogy. If you buy a refrigerator for $3000, and it breaks down immediately upon the expiration of the warranty, that refrigerator has done you some harm. If you buy one for $300, and it does the same, you should count yourself lucky.",300 refrigerator i am still waiting sequel,upon release manos hands fate swept theaters throughout world causing mass hysteria panic power outages as theater owners tried keep up withe endless demands more power power more projectors sound equipment concerns general health worlds population kept it shelved several years but now finally greatest film all time has been unleashed upon public with score by john coltrane frank zappa who also appears as master direction by martin coppolla illegitimate son mr scorses francis ford script written by stephen king at age 14 manos is as legendary as it is brilliant not there really is no sense beating this poor film into ground any more than it already has been what i find sort amusing is that after third or fourth viewing yes i admit it im masochist is that its sort grown me bit like fungus manos is about small family yankees who get lost southwestern us end up place which nobody can leave inn overseen by twitching human goat hybrid named torgo who steals show owned by enigmatic master worshipper manos who collects wives through trapping them at his inn i guess you can figure rest film out pretty easily this ends up being horror film with virtually no horror action film with most poorly shot action sequences ive ever seen artsy jazz vehicle with such poor acoustic sound quality that it would have been much better with just groovy soundtrack no dialog biggest problem with manos is what we call production values cut chase there are none there is too much wrong with this film list it all out so instead i will list whats right with it acting is not entirely awful but sound editing pacing camera work are so bad that actors all look totally ridiculous at all times script is not worst ive seen but it is lost jerks irks pace dramamine recommended finally plot is no worse than some recent hollywood horror catastrophes i have seen but it is swept up maelstrom maleficence emanating directors chair result would make great object example film production class what not do most people will find this film tedious idiotic unwatchable average person i think will turn it off after first 5 minutes countryside pans during opening driving scenes some would argue that my rating 2 is too high i wont argue that point but i will explain that i reserve 1 those truly aggravating films which do more harm then good serve no purpose do nothing expand boundaries contemporary film makers cinema goers imaginations most these are commercial hollywood romantic sex comedies horror films manos at least occupies important place film making history should really be seen by would be film makers participants at least it didnt cost much make at least it does no real long lasting harm cant say same example american pie these reasons i reserve rating 1 such truly harmful films distinction is best made through analogy if you buy refrigerator 3000 it breaks down immediately upon expiration warranty that refrigerator has done you some harm if you buy one 300 it does same you should count yourself lucky,0.48918534080298776,0.14507586367880482,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.34}"

,"""Mike I'm scared."" ""Of WHAT?""","Okay. This is officially the worst movie ever made. Not because it's poorly done, because there are movies, like ""Monster A-Go-Go"", that are more poorly conceived, acted, directed, filmed, and edited. But ""Manos"" stands out because it is so incomprehensibly bad. It is SO bad that it is hard to imagine it was done by accident. It often seems like they film is supposed to be bad, and that the director is actually brilliantly creating a horrible film, because this kind of badness doesn't usually come from apathy or a lack of talent and money. This is worse.The film is also very icky and very dull. Almost nothing happens (certainly not anything interesting) and if you survive the first ten minutes of driving around the countryside you'll just want everyone in the film to die.However, because this movie is so brilliantly and incredibly bad, I suggest everyone watch it just to know it. Everyone should see ""Citizen Kane"" because it is the watermark for all good movies. Everyone should see ""Manos"" for the same reason. It puts all other bad movies to shame. I do suggest though, that it be watched ONLY as the MST3K version, since the team does a good job riffing the film. Even they seem to be too caught up in the film's reeking badness at times that they are just stunned, but they still do a good job. I also doubt you would find a regular version of this movie, since I doubt anyone would be crazy enough to have one.Interestingly, the guy who plays the mean, stupid, and totally useless husband wrote, directed, and produced the film, and the guy who plays ""The Master"" did the art direction. They both failed in all their work. No one in this movie has ever done anything else. Thank God.",mike im scared what,okay this is officially worst movie ever made not because its poorly done because there are movies like monster go go that are more poorly conceived acted directed filmed edited but manos stands out because it is so incomprehensibly bad it is so bad that it is hard imagine it was done by accident it often seems like they film is supposed be bad that director is actually brilliantly creating horrible film because this kind badness doesnt usually come apathy or lack talent money this is worse film is also very icky very dull almost nothing happens certainly not anything interesting if you survive first ten minutes driving around countryside youll just want everyone film die however because this movie is so brilliantly incredibly bad i suggest everyone watch it just know it everyone should see citizen kane because it is watermark all good movies everyone should see manos same reason it puts all other bad movies shame i do suggest though that it be watched only as mst3k version since team does good job riffing film even they seem be too caught up films reeking badness at times that they are just stunned but they still do good job i also doubt you would find regular version this movie since i doubt anyone would be crazy enough have one interestingly guy who plays mean stupid totally useless husband wrote directed produced film guy who plays master did art direction they both failed all their work no one this movie has ever done anything else thank god,0.5664259205706573,-0.15014411027568916,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
2.0,"Believe it or not, this *was* made by actual human beings","There are many, many awful horror movies out there these days, especially with the dominance of DVD technology, 'direct-to-video' releases and the new Renaissance of 'microbudget' horror movies. Not since the days of the triple bill dusk-to-dawn drive in have there been so many craptastic movies clamoring for the viewer's attention.Still, even in this new era of ""Troma"" productions and legions of ""Z"" level horror movies, ""Manos"" is the champ. Sure there are worse written and directed and performed horror movies available (""Rock And Roll Nightmare II: The Intercessor"" and ""Existo"" come to mind immediately), but ""Manos"" is special. ""Manos"" is different.""Manos: The Hands Of Fate"" isn't so much a ""bad"" movie as it is an ""anti-movie"". Not one scene, not one shot, not one line of spoken dialog, works as cinematic entertainment. To put the metaphor another way, it isn't even that the photography, writing, costumes, etc are ""incompetent""...it's more like the whole film was done by people who didn't seem to realize they were supposed to be making a *film* instead of an 8th grade dramatic production of ""Helter Skelter"".Again, there have been flatter performances and worse actors captured on film; Roger Corman alone is responsible for 30,000 lines of dialog that ring more false than what we hear in ""Manos"". But there is a decent, spooky film trying to get out from under the ruins of the screenplay here, and that dissonance makes the experience even worse for the viewer. For instance: the actor playing Torgo truly looks emotionally damaged, like someone you'd find on the floor of a bus station rest room, but his speeches are circular, exasperating and delivered in a shaky, badly mixed alto that makes me wish he'd just SHUT UP. There's a nasty little moment where Torgo is sacrificed so his master can create a totem device called the ""Hand Of Glory""...but it's staged with all the panache of a salon wash-and-set. The whole movie is like that. I feel badly for the director - he obviously had a nice little Lovecraft/Derleth style horror story he wanted to tell, and some evocative Satanic ritualistic vibes he wanted to convey. But every single artistic judgment he made here - how long to hold the shots, how to pace the speech rhythms of the actors, how to stage the lingerie wrestling scene with the wives, how to mix the dubbed vocals, how to end the film...every single aspect of the film was wrong-headed and bad and irritating.Every student and connoisseur of bad horror films should see ""Manos"" and get their horizons broadened about how wrong-headed and ill-advised it is possible to be when it comes to making a film. You may see films that are technically worse, but I can guarantee than it is ""Manos"" that sticks in your memory long after you've forgotten the others.",believe it or not this was made by actual human beings,there are many many awful horror movies out there these days especially with dominance dvd technology direct video releases new renaissance microbudget horror movies not since days triple bill dusk dawn drive have there been so many craptastic movies clamoring viewers attention still even this new era troma productions legions z level horror movies manos is champ sure there are worse written directed performed horror movies available rock roll nightmare ii intercessor existo come mind immediately but manos is special manos is different manos hands fate isnt so much bad movie as it is anti movie not one scene not one shot not one line spoken dialog works as cinematic entertainment put metaphor another way it isnt even that photography writing costumes etc are incompetent its more like whole film was done by people who didnt seem realize they were supposed be making film instead 8th grade dramatic production helter skelter again there have been flatter performances worse actors captured film roger corman alone is responsible 30 000 lines dialog that ring more false than what we hear manos but there is decent spooky film trying get out under ruins screenplay here that dissonance makes experience even worse viewer instance actor playing torgo truly looks emotionally damaged like someone youd find floor bus station rest room but his speeches are circular exasperating delivered shaky badly mixed alto that makes me wish hed just shut up theres nasty little moment where torgo is sacrificed so his master can create totem device called hand glory but its staged with all panache salon wash set whole movie is like that i feel badly director he obviously had nice little lovecraft derleth style horror story he wanted tell some evocative satanic ritualistic vibes he wanted convey but every single artistic judgment he made here how long hold shots how pace speech rhythms actors how stage lingerie wrestling scene with wives how mix dubbed vocals how end film every single aspect film was wrong headed bad irritating every student connoisseur bad horror films should see manos get their horizons broadened about how wrong headed ill advised it is possible be when it comes making film you may see films that are technically worse but i can guarantee than it is manos that sticks your memory long after youve forgotten others,0.5734897999603882,-0.09322850352262116,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.41}"

1.0,One of the finest examples of great auteur filmmaking,"Equaled in clarity of vision and flawless execution only by the greater works of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock, brilliant independent film auteur Hal Warren's Manos: The Hands of Fate' transcends its genre to do everything that it should and even more. Not only is it riveting edge of your seat entertainment, it also boasts a psychological depth unequaled by any other horror movie, achieved mostly through John Reynold's Oscar-worthy, divinely subtle performance as the tormented, tragically misshapen caretaker Torgo. Part Quasimodo, part Hamlet, this gentle soul's noble end, in which he is massaged to death by a group of terrifying succubae in luscious robes, is unarguable one of the most poignant in motion picture history  it is both a tragedy and a triumph of the human spirit. Oh, was I alone with a tear in the eye at the end!Indeed, Hal Warren's masterpiece achieves the perfect balance between the heartrendingly sad, the refreshingly sardonic, and the chillingly satanic. The Master and his hellbeast are as much evil personified as Margaret is the embodiment of goodness and chastity. In a way, this is the definitive modern-day equivalent of Goethe's Faust, though even more sublime in the simple poetry of its dialogue. When Torgo describes his master as being `not dead the way you know it' and `with us always' he is speaking for all of us, how we truly live on through the memory of our words and deeds in the minds of those who follow us, be they righteous or malevolent.Hal Warran not only changed the face of the Texan film industry by encapsulating such a grand story in less than 75 minutes, it also helped usher in a whole new perspective of looking at film, discovering different forms which never would have been conceived. Also, it's obviously a very personal film for Warren, who allows us to share his love and devotion to the project, and it is a truly moving, cathartic experience.It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and maybe  just maybe  you'll learn a little bit about yourself.",one finest examples great auteur filmmaking,equaled clarity vision flawless execution only by greater works orson welles alfred hitchcock brilliant independent film auteur hal warrens manos hands fate transcends its genre do everything that it should even more not only is it riveting edge your seat entertainment it also boasts psychological depth unequaled by any other horror movie achieved mostly through john reynolds oscar worthy divinely subtle performance as tormented tragically misshapen caretaker torgo part quasimodo part hamlet this gentle souls noble end which he is massaged death by group terrifying succubae luscious robes is unarguable one most poignant motion picture history it is both tragedy triumph human spirit oh was i alone with tear eye at end indeed hal warrens masterpiece achieves perfect balance between heartrendingly sad refreshingly sardonic chillingly satanic master his hellbeast are as much evil personified as margaret is embodiment goodness chastity way this is definitive modern day equivalent goethes faust though even more sublime simple poetry its dialogue when torgo describes his master as being not dead way you know it with us always he is speaking all us how we truly live through memory our words deeds minds those who follow us be they righteous or malevolent hal warran not only changed face texan film industry by encapsulating such grand story less than 75 minutes it also helped usher whole new perspective looking at film discovering different forms which never would have been conceived also its obviously very personal film warren who allows us share his love devotion project it is truly moving cathartic experience it will make you laugh it will make you cry maybe just maybe youll learn little bit about yourself,0.6361513090084518,0.13794191919191917,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,'Manos': An Enigma of Celluloid,"When I watch a film for the first time it is generally quite easy for me to establish an initial opinion of the film at hand. At times I will come to this very website and submit a rating of the given film or perhaps I will turn to a friend and give my thoughts of the film (which tend to be quite clear). Well, after reading quite a few extremely hyped reviews and discussions throughout the internet, I decided to try my luck and buy the alleged worst film of all time: ''Manos': The Hands of Fate'. Let it be clear that this review does not pertain to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of the film; rather it applies to Hal P. Warren's original, cut-and-dry, El Paso-born version of the film. ''Manos': The Hands of Fate' may very well be, one of the only films of which classification is painstakingly difficult to near-impossible. The film leaves a quaint, surreal, and indecisive effect upon the viewer which is what leads to the formulation of this strange conclusion.Warren's film opens on a vacationing family traveling through El Paso, Texas. The family consists of little Debbie (Jackey Neyman), Margaret (Diane Mahree), and Mike (played by our very own Hal P. Warren). Surely enough, the travelers are soon found lost on the way to their vacation site. They eventually turn onto a long dirt road marked by a sign promising a ""Valley Lodge"". After a great deal of aimless meandering throughout the backwoods of El Paso, the vacationers come across a mysterious Lodge run by an awkward and deformed Satyr named Torgo (John Reynolds). Seeing as it is getting late, the visitors ask about staying the night only to be deterred by Torgo's ominous words ""The master would not approve."" After some pressure from the family, Torgo folds and allows the newcomers to stay. As the visitors enter the lodge they are welcomed by a mantel full of strange hand-like pagan icons and sculptures, accompanied by a strange portrait of presumably The Master and his hound. As Michael and his wife Margaret observe the strangeness of the portrait and their surroundings, a strange howl is heard from outside in the desert. Soon strange happenings begin around this lodge of sins, as Michael and his family's fate is determined by ""the hands of fate""To be blunt, the film is simply quite technically limited. Supposedly the film was shot entirely on one camera which was only capable of shooting 60 seconds of film at a time. To say that this hurt the film would be an untrue, if anything it helped the pacing of this little low-budget flick. Hal P. Warren was a director with literally no experience or conceived directorial abilities; he had no knowledge of pacing or camera work (if he had any it was most likely limited to home videos). The acting for the most part is quite dismal, the only exception being a wonderful character conceived by Warren named Torgo. Reynolds' portrayal of Torgo is supreme; although having no professional training or profession acting experience in cinema he creates a one of-a-kind character, which has been quite unparalleled in cult-cinema. No matter how much one hates this film, they will always remember the timid and tormented Torgo, uttering his infamous line: ""The Master would not approve."" The music featured in the film is quite repetitive and amateur, although at times it does add to the feel, aid the pacing, and promote the overall camp-factor of the film (which was sometimes delightful). The cinematography is certainly not note-worthy, nor is the lighting. The editing seemed to have been done with haste and is one of the key factors which seems to have earned this film its reputation. One thing however, which is not widely criticized by viewers is the plot. It is a plot with great potential that was realized by Warren; at the time it would have been quite fresh. Interestingly enough, it could vaguely be seen as a blundering, early version of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (not to say that Tobe Hooper drew any influence from ''Manos': The Hands of Fate').Well, this is widely considered to be the downright worst of the worst  the bottom of the bottom. As stated earlier, I cannot place this film on a scale of one to ten, yet I can argue that this is a false statement. Almost every aspect of the film is done poorly, yet as odd as it sounds, the movie generates a charming and enjoyable little atmosphere; it simply does not feel like the worst one out there. There are plenty of films which are far less enjoyable to watch than Manos. Technically speaking the assumption can be made that it is the worst, but then again there are films with far more dismal lighting, far more sloppy camera work and far worse pacing. One could contend that the acting is downright dismal and corpse-like in every respect, yet there are films with worse acting and absolutely no memorable or quotable (Torgo - whether it be mocking or homage) characters. Hence, in many respects Hal Warren's single 1966 production isn't the worst piece of celluloid out there, yet at the same time it possess many, if not all of the qualities which could be attributed to the worst film of all time. However, the goal of this review was not to debunk the position in cinema history ''Manos': The Hands of Fate' has achieved, but rather to offer a little insight into what this film has to offer. In all fairness, I enjoyed it in a wonderful, campy, and surreal sort of way... after all, what other film is out there like this? What film is there that was made on possibly the lowest budget of all time, featuring the work of the most cinematically inept individuals, yet despite these obvious flaws has kept people talking about it for years to come?",manos enigma celluloid,when i watch film first time it is generally quite easy me establish initial opinion film at hand at times i will come this very website submit

one camera which was only capable shooting 60 seconds film at time say that this hurt film would be untrue if anything it helped pacing this little low budget flick hal p warren was director with literally no experience or conceived directorial abilities he had no knowledge pacing or camera work if he had any it was most likely limited home videos acting most part is quite dismal only exception being wonderful character conceived by warren named torgo reynolds portrayal torgo is supreme although having no professional training or profession acting experience cinema he creates one kind character which has been quite unparalleled cult cinema no matter how much one hates this film they will always remember timid tormented torgo uttering his infamous line master would not approve music featured film is quite repetitive amateur although at times it does add feel aid pacing promote overall camp factor film which was sometimes delightful cinematography is certainly not note worthy nor is lighting editing seemed have been done with haste is one key factors which seems have earned this film its reputation one thing however which is not widely criticized by viewers is plot it is plot with great potential that was realized by warren at time it would have been quite fresh interestingly enough it could vaguely be seen as blundering early version texas chain saw massacre not say that tobe hooper drew any influence manos hands fate well this is widely considered be downright worst worst bottom bottom as stated earlier i cannot place this film scale one ten yet i can argue that this is false statement almost every aspect film is done poorly yet as odd as it sounds movie generates charming enjoyable little atmosphere it simply does not feel like worst one out there there are plenty films which are far less enjoyable watch than manos technically speaking assumption can be made that it is worst but then again there are films with far more dismal lighting far more sloppy camera work far worse pacing one could contend that acting is downright dismal corpse like every respect yet there are films with worse acting absolutely no memorable or quotable torgo whether it be mocking or homage characters hence many respects hal warrens single 1966 production isnt worst piece celluloid out there yet at same time it possess many if not all qualities which could be attributed worst film all time however goal this review was not debunk position cinema history manos hands fate has achieved but rather offer little insight into what this film has offer all fairness i enjoyed it wonderful campy surreal sort way after all what other film is out there like this what film is there that was made possibly lowest budget all time featuring work most cinematically inept

1.0,"Keep Manos at #1 (of the bottom heap, of course)!!!","Frankly, I am outraged to see so many 10s for this movie, being that no sane person would ever give such a grade to this unrelentinly boring piece of ... (man, it's quite hard not to use profanity with a movie like this). If people were giving Manos 10s just so that some rival could snatch the #1 worst movie title then that is truly sad. Manos is morally the true winner here in that respect.Not much can be said that has not been said already about this movie. I would know, since reading the IMDb comments, getting a load of laughs from them and feeling a complete sense of empathy with other poor souls who dared to watch this movie, knowing exactly where they are coming from, is just about the only good thing I have gotten out of MTHOF. Yes, the movie was an eyeopener. I had no idea how bad movies could be before Manos. Ed Wood movies at least provide laughs and something coherent to look at, even though the realization is shoddy to a humorous magnitude. A so-bad-it's-traumatizing movie is an entirely different league from a so-bad-it's-good movie. In Manos we basically have: driving; boredom; more driving; more boredom; a feeling of being mentally raped within the first 15 minutes (not many movies can do that, you know!); more driving; some rather purposeless necking; (did I mention the driving?); Torgo, our favorite strange person with deformed knees; a family, in whose creation Darwin's laws of natural selection seem to have been completely ignored, gladly deciding to spend the night in ""the master's"" house; a touching display of affection through holding hands (or is it?); a bored kid; a dead dog, i think; some melodramatic ""hand-waving""; a puzzlingly out-of-the-blue all-out wrestling match amongst the ladies, thoroughly making me question my previous enjoyment in watching such activities; how massaging someone to death would look like and last, but quite least, the absolutely tasteless ending, complete with a subsequent cast introduction to give it a ""campy"" feel. Oh, humanity.It is a sheer hilarity people bought into the hype and actually came in doves to see the premiere. The movie poster that advertized MTHOF is just precious. This stinker is the kind of movie you just can't help but love to hate.Rating 1/10 (so far only 5 movies have ever received this dubious grade in my book)Scale:Positive opinion of a movie: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OKNeutral opinion of a movie: 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 MediocreNegative opinion of a movie: 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE",keep manos at bottom heap course,frankly i am outraged see so many 10s this movie being that no sane person would ever give such grade this unrelentinly boring piece man its quite hard not use profanity with movie like this if people were giving manos 10s just so that some rival could snatch worst movie title then that is truly sad manos is morally true winner here that respect not much can be said that has not been said already about this movie i would know since reading imdb comments getting load laughs them feeling complete sense empathy with other poor souls who dared watch this movie knowing exactly where they are coming is just about only good thing i have gotten out mthof yes movie was eyeopener i had no idea how bad movies could be before manos ed wood movies at least provide laughs something coherent look at even though realization is shoddy humorous magnitude so bad its traumatizing movie is entirely different league so bad its good movie manos we basically have driving boredom more driving more boredom feeling being mentally raped within first 15 minutes not many movies can do that you know more driving some rather purposeless necking did i mention driving torgo our favorite strange person with deformed knees family whose creation darwins laws natural selection seem have been completely ignored gladly deciding spend night masters house touching display affection through holding hands or is it bored kid dead dog i think some melodramatic hand waving puzzlingly out blue all out wrestling match amongst ladies thoroughly making me question my previous enjoyment watching such activities how massaging someone death would look like last but quite least absolutely tasteless ending complete with subsequent cast introduction give it campy feel oh humanity it is sheer hilarity people bought into hype actually came doves see premiere movie poster that advertized mthof is just precious this stinker is kind movie you just cant help but love hate rating 1 10 so far only 5 movies have ever received this dubious grade my book scale positive opinion movie 10 masterpiece 9 excellent 8 good 7 okneutral opinion movie 6 adequate 5 average 4 mediocrenegative opinion movie 3 poor 2 bad 1 horrible,0.5933140933140931,-0.025757575757575733,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.35}"
1.0,"If nothing else, then at least you'll learn that nothing else could ever be this bad...","I watched Manos last night.Oh, I was the cocky one, intrigued by all the attention Manos receives, even though it is, after all, 40 years old. Sure, I thought, it'll be a laugh to investigate the claim that this might be the worst film ever made. Why, if its that bad, there must at least be comedy value in its awfulness? And in consolation, it is only an hour long.No, the warnings are true and serious, this is bloody terrible.After twenty minutes, I had stopped sniggering at the unimaginable ineptitude. I only realised that twenty minutes had passed when i flicked on the timer on the DVD; I honestly thought it was closer to forty-five.After forty minutes I was shifting uncomfortably in my chair and I wanted to cry.After an hour, I was submerged in despairing, pointless anger. I was angry with everyone involved in the film, angry with my cup of tea, my flat, the world, even God Himself (or Herself).You will lose faith in humanity watching this film.Imagine any conceivable measure for any possible aspect of film-making, and Manos still gets zero out of whatever. This ""film"" fails so utterly in every way, you'll wonder if anyone involved in its creation had ever seen or even heard of films or television. No, more than that, you'll wonder if they'd ever even spent a day on this planet. There isn't one single moment that you forget that these people are standing in front of a camera, ineptly executing one of the most awful scripts ever imagined.I've never been so insulted by any form of ""entertainment"". I lost count of the number of times I was beaten over the head with a totally obvious point. I lost count of the number of times completely random stuff just *happened* with no genesis or consequence. I certainly didn't lose count of the number of locations used, or the number of musical cues, you could count those on one hand, after a circular saw accident. It baffled me that they never realised that you can't shoot film at night without some form of lighting. And the music itself... oh God. I don't need to warn you about spoilers, there's plenty to complain about without resorting to inconsequential detail. Like the way that every time it cuts to the family, they're just standing, for no reason, in the same spot, waiting to talk to the camera. Like the absolutely shocking and disgraceful editing. People jump from awake to asleep and back, from one spot to another, from happy to sad, instantaneously. The awful acting... I don't know, its like everyone was given a piece of paper with some emoticons for happy, sad, scared and angry, and told to learn them off. The dialogue... well, technically it *is* dialogue, in the same way that McDonalds is food. Well, some people might enjoy McDonalds. See, I can't think of a parallel awfulness; ""Manos"" is to ""bad"" as... you can't finish that sentence.Good Lord, I could go on, and on, and on, but I won't. This film cannot warrant anything but a 1/10 on IMDb. I haven't seen any of the other bottom 100 as of today, but i'm willing to bet that they are at least a rough approximation to what we call a ""film"". This is not.Seriously, you really, really need to be in a masochistic kinda mood to see this out. I had to leave the screen timer on after 45 minutes just so I could keep reminding myself that, second by second, it *would* end. Because Hell itself might just be never-ending Manos.",if nothing else then at least youll learn that nothing else could ever be this bad,i watched manos last night oh i was cocky one intrigued by all attention manos receives even though it is after all 40 years old sure i thought itll be laugh investigate claim that this might be worst film ever made why if its that bad there must at least be comedy value its awfulness consolation it is only hour long no warnings are true serious this is bloody terrible after twenty minutes i had stopped sniggering at unimaginable ineptitude i only realised that twenty minutes had passed when i flicked timer dvd i honestly thought it was closer forty five after forty minutes i was shifting uncomfortably my chair i wanted cry after hour i was submerged despairing pointless anger i was angry with everyone involved film angry with my cup tea my flat world even god himself or herself you will lose faith humanity watching this film imagine any conceivable measure any possible aspect film making manos still gets zero out whatever this film fails so utterly every way youll wonder if anyone involved its creation had ever seen or even heard films or television no more than that youll wonder if theyd ever even spent day this planet there isnt one single moment that you forget that these people are standing front camera ineptly executing one most awful scripts ever imagined ive never been so insulted by any form entertainment i lost count number times i was beaten over head with totally obvious point i lost count number times completely random stuff just happened with no genesis or consequence i certainly didnt lose count number locations used or number musical cues you could count those one hand after circular saw accident it baffled me that they never realised that you cant shoot film at night without some form lighting music itself oh god i dont need warn you about spoilers theres plenty complain about without resorting inconsequential detail like way that every time it cuts family theyre just standing no reason same spot waiting talk camera like absolutely shocking disgraceful editing people jump awake asleep back one spot another happy sad instantaneously awful acting i dont know its like everyone was given piece paper with some emoticons happy sad scared angry told learn them off dialogue well technically it is dialogue same way that mcdonalds is food well some people might enjoy mcdonalds see i cant think parallel awfulness manos is bad as you cant finish that sentence good lord i could go but i wont this film cannot warrant anything but 1 10 imdb i havent seen any other bottom 100 as today but im willing bet that they are at least rough approximation what we call film this is not seriously you really really need be masochistic kinda mood see this out i had leave screen timer after 45 minutes just so i could keep reminding myself that second by second it would end because hell itself might just be never ending manos,0.5577803799115275,-0.14793130366900858,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"

5.0,I love this movie and will defend it,"How have we taken so long to get this movie on to this website?Since this movie was discovered by Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1993 - which you can hear The Mads discuss on our podcast - this film has been proclaimed the worst movie ever made.Please. I've seen way worse films.In fact, Becca and I bonded over the fact that we share a strange adoration for this movie, which seems to exist in its own unique universe that doesn't follow the laws of man.This is a movie that was created as a bet. You read that correctly.El Paso, Texas is where Harold Warren, an insurance and fertilizer salesman, and screenwriter Stirling Silliphant - who wrote the movie version of In the Heat of the Night and, of course, Over the Top - made a bet in a coffee shop that Warren could make his own horror movie all by himself. To be fair, Warren had done some acting himself and even appeared on Silliphant's TV show Route 66.Not only did Warren make that movie, he had the scent of auteur all over himself, writing, producing and even starring in the resulting movie along with theater actors Tom Neyman and John Reynolds.Nobody in the crew had any experience making a movie. They only had $19,000 in their budget. And the result was a movie that opened to little fanfare at the Capri Theater in El Paso, where one limo drove each person one at a time, repeating the same loop, and it died except for some drive-ins in West Texas and New Mexico.If Warren had been smart enough to put a copyright on his film, the story would have ended there. But he wasn't. And he didn't. So here we are.As you can hear in the link above, Frank Conniff found Manos while looking through a box of movies for the show Mystery Science Theater 3000. The film had been playing on TV for some years - as cheap as $20 for a rental - and was available from public domain suppliers for some time. Oh you internet era readers, never having to buy films sight unseen from mail order.Conniff would go on to say that Manos ""seemed like it was maybe a crime against humanity, but you couldn't be sure"" and ""has an atmosphere, a vibe"" that made it appropriate for the show.""While on vacation near El Paso, Texas, Michael, Margaret, their young daughter Debbie and their dog, Peppy - all dubbed like they're in an Italian movie - are looking for the Valley Lodge. They're lost and the film takes forever to find them, spending nearly nine minutes on footage of driving and a teenage couple making out and drinking.The family finally finds a house in the middle of nowhere, which is watched over by Torgo, a satyr that moves at a glacial pace for most of the film. He was played by John Reynolds, who sadly committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a shotgun a month before the film played in his hometown. He was on LSD for most of the filming of Manos.For some reason, the family stays the night, despite the Satanic portrait of the master and his dog with glowing eyes. They even decide to stay after Peppy the dog is killed by unseen forces and Torgo begins trying to put the make on Margaret.Eventually, we meet the Master and his many brides as they sleep around a gigantic fire. They awaken and demand that Michael be sacrificed to their god named Manos. At this point, you may look up the fact that manos is Spanish for hands, meaning that the title of this film could be Hands: The Hands of Fate.While all that's happening, The Master decides to sacrifice Torgo and his first wife too. There are numerous catfights before the family escapes into the desert night, which makes no sense as this movie is both shot night for day and day for night.When we return to the house, Michael has now taken on Torgo's role and his wife and daughter now belong to The Master.Often, people talk about just how hard it is to make an HP Lovecraft film. They've probably never seen this movie, a film that has no horizon lines, that always takes place in a world where it's either too bright to be night or too dark to be daytime, as people say inane things and move strangely and women wear diaphanous gowns and men have smocks with giant red hands on them.This is a movie that promises ""A cult of weird, horrible people who gather beautiful women only to deface them with a burning hand!"" and then makes the bold statement - nay it's a command - ""No one seated the last 10 minutes! We defy you to guess the ending... and ask you not to divulge it!""It lives up to every bit of that hyperbole.Despite the film's negative reception, Harold Warren was so proud of it that he began wearing the Master's robe every Halloween. His son now carries on the tradition. Not bad for a film where the only people who got paid were Debbie (Jackey Neyman Jones) who got a bicycle and the Doberman who got a bag of dog food. What about Peppy?",i love this movie will defend it,how have we taken so long get this movie this website since this movie was discovered by mystery science theater 3000 1993 which you can hear mads discuss our podcast this film has been proclaimed worst movie ever made please ive seen way worse films fact becca i bonded over fact that we share strange adoration this movie which seems exist its own unique universe that doesnt follow laws man this is movie that was created as bet you read that correctly el paso texas is where harold warren insurance fertilizer salesman screenwriter stirling silliphant who wrote movie version heat night course over top made bet coffee shop that warren could make his own horror movie all by himself be fair warren had done some acting himself even appeared silliphants tv show route 66 not only did warren make that movie he had scent auteur all over himself writing producing even starring resulting movie along with theater actors tom neyman john reynolds nobody crew had any experience making movie they only had 19 000 their budget result was movie that opened little fanfare at capri theater el paso where one limo drove each person one at time repeating same loop it died except some drive ins west texas new mexico if warren had been smart enough put copyright his film story would have ended there but he wasnt he didnt so here we are as you can hear link above frank conniff found manos while looking through box movies show mystery science theater 3000 film had been playing tv some years as cheap as 20 rental was available public domain suppliers some time oh you internet era readers never having buy films sight unseen mail order conniff would go say that manos seemed like it was maybe crime against humanity but you couldnt be sure has atmosphere vibe that made it appropriate show while vacation near el paso texas michael margaret their young daughter debbie their dog peppy all dubbed like theyre italian movie are looking valley lodge theyre lost film takes forever find them spending nearly nine minutes footage driving teenage couple making out drinking family finally finds house middle nowhere which is watched over by torgo satyr that moves at glacial pace most film he was played by john reynolds who sadly committed suicide by shooting himself head with shotgun month before film played his hometown he was lsd most filming manos some reason family stays night despite satanic portrait master his dog with glowing eyes they even decide stay after peppy dog is killed by unseen forces torgo begins trying put make margaret eventually we meet master his many brides as they sleep around gigantic fire they awaken demand that michael be sacrificed their god named manos at this point you may look up fact that manos is spanish hands meaning that title this film could be hands hands fate while all thats happening master decides sacrifice torgo his first wife too there are numerous catfights before family escapes into desert night which makes no sense as this movie is both shot night day day night when we return house michael has now taken torgos role his wife daughter now belong master often people talk about just how hard it is make hp lovecraft film theyve probably never seen this movie film that has no horizon lines that always takes place world where its either too bright be night or too dark be daytime as people say inane things move strangely women wear diaphanous gowns men have smocks with giant red hands them this is movie that promises cult weird horrible people who gather beautiful women only deface them with burning hand then makes bold statement nay its command no one seated last 10 minutes we defy you guess ending ask you not divulge it it lives up every bit that hyperbole despite films negative reception harold warren was so proud it that he began wearing masters robe every halloween his son now carries tradition not bad film where only people who got paid were debbie jackey neyman jones who got bicycle doberman who got bag dog food what about peppy,0.5509456813028242,0.10053242888064313,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"
1.0,Total ineptitude in every way possible,"If it wasn't for MST3K, I wouldn't have seen Manos: The Hands of Fate. I knew I had to see it to see if it really was that bad. The negative criticisms and those slamming it as the worst movie ever do not lie, Manos: The Hands of Fate is as bad as all that. There is such thing as a terrible movie that has novelty comic value, but there is also such thing as a movie that is too inept to take that into consideration. Some will disagree, but I consider Manos: The Hands of Fate as a good example of the latter. To call the way the movie is made amateurish is being too kind, the camera work and editing are all over the place and makes anything that happens incomprehensible. The visual effects are dated and make everything even more artificial than it already is, while the bizarre and often out of sync sound effects and a score that is shrill and monotonous are enough to make your ears bleed. And even when your poor ears are suffering enough, they are assaulted even more by dialogue that is stilted, insultingly cheesy and too talky and some of the worst and annoying acting ever in film history. The villain is quite possibly the most laughable and underwhelming villain ever and you'd be hard pressed to find one that is worse-acted than here. Torga is the best thing about Manos: The Hands of Fate, but that's saying nothing as he's still irritating. The direction is so flat that you have to look hard to find evidence of any direction at all, while the story is incredibly thin and is so plodding that you're dying of boredom.

1.0,Writer/director/producer/actor Harold P. Warren was a fertilizer salesman before this film---'nuff said!,"As I indicated in the summary, Warren was a fertilizer salesman and frankly, his taking on the helm of this film isn't much of a stretch (insert your own scatological joke here). The film is a low-budget mess--so cheap and so badly put together that it is not at all hyperbole to say that Ed Wood never made a film quite this bad! Sure, Wood's films were horrible, but at least they had better production values than a 32 second limit to scenes due to the cheap equipment or the use of only three people to dub all the voices in the film! Heck, compared to this mess, PLAN 9 is a Merchant-Ivory production!! The film begins with a guy getting lost with his family and refusing to ask for directions (insert own dumb husband joke here). Naturally, he arrives at a home whose caretaker is ""special"". This freaky guy talks about ""the Master won't like you staying here"" and crap like that and so what do these idiots do?! Yep, they get out and practically force themselves on this deformed halfwit. And, almost as soon as they get out of the car, the wife begins whining. You can tell she knew she was in a horror film because everything that happened sounded like it was the apocalypse. I half expected her to say something like ""They have blue curtains....YAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" or ""Honey,....I think the couch is going to eat us....YAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"". I know that most of this was the problem of the dubbing, but it also looked like the lady was told to scream and act scared about everything!! Well, the film only gets worse from this terrible start. When bad things finally do come, the screaming and silliness goes into overdrive.

1.0,"Hell is ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" on an eternal loop","Directing: The direction in this ""film"" reminds me of one of those people who simply cannot, for the life of them, hang a picture straight on a wall. The problem is not that the person is too close to the picture, and therefore cannot see the mistakes he's making. The problem is also not an inability to make necessary adjustments after stepping back to look at one's work. The problem with this film's direction is much deeper. Do not be fooled into thinking that this film was bad ""on purpose,"" because if there is a God, this cannot be true. In the history of the world, no manure salesman has decided to make a crappy (pun intended) movie for the purpose of defining ""the crappiest movie."" No. The problem here is about the complete and utter failure of humanity. The word ""never"" had not yet been defined until this movie was ""made."" In the end, there's no reason to consider that this movie had a director.Editing: When you were a child, you probably tried to shove two mismatched puzzle pieces together -- I admit, I've even tried this -- but you and I eventually learned that this is wrong. The editor of this film did not learn this valuable life lesson. The credits at the end of the film are the centerpieces of the editing. I only now understand that, quite possibly, editing did not occur in the production of this film.Writing: This movie despises its writer, hates him in fact. In truth, there is no reason to think that this movie was actually written. I babysat an autistic child once. Even HE couldn't have written this tripe.Acting: I understand that some people don't really get what it means to be in front of a camera. This is not the problem here. Although they have human faces and voices (all dubbed, of course), these ""actors"" are unable to even imagine themselves as being in a film. The uniqueness of their ineptitude is overwhelming at times.This is a horror flick. The actual film isn't the horror; the horror isn't even filmed in fact. The true horror is this movie's sweeping destruction of the elements of film -- direction, editing, writing, acting, etc. Even the title, which translates to ""Hands: The Hands of Fate,"" would baffle the Sphinx. I know that Duran Duran named themselves twice, but this title is something else entirely. It is a sucker punch to everything linguistic and meaningful.Why this movie took 2 and a half months to film is beyond me. This movie is 74 minutes long. There is no reason to believe that this movie took more than 74 minutes to film. After all, without a director, editor, writer, or actors, it's truly difficult for me to say that this is a film. There are those who want to find genius in such a deconstructive expression. Make no mistake, this movie is not smart, is not clever. The deepest meaning one can glean from manure is to never again step in it. If you value anything even remotely artful, you will keep yourself oblivious to this ""movie.""

1.0,The antithesis to good movies.,"This isn't a movie. This isn't even a home video. It's a home video that aspired to be a movie but crashed somewhere in-between, and plummeted through the abyss to depths unimaginable by the mainstream. Coherence is the film's greatest foe: bizarrity and incompetence its watchwords. This is it, bad movie buffs. This is Manos: Hands of Fate.Years ago, in the dusty desert outside El Paso, an unknown fertilizer salesman decided to craft a horror film with the assistance of friends throughout the El Paso area, and a legend was born. Armed with $19,000 dollars, a cheap 16mm camera, and absolutely no knowledge of the art of film-making whatsoever, Hal P. Warren set out upon his masterpiece.There is absolutely no redeeming quality about Manos. There is no directing, the editing appears as if it was done by a blind member of some mud-crawling insect species, the artwork is a stain upon the name of art, the script is a poorly cluttered and illogical joke masking the director's fantasies, the dialog will have you tear out your eardrums with your fingernails, and the acting is so atrocious you will feel as if the movie has violated you. It isn't as bad as Monster-a-Go-Go, but it almost manages to snatch the sorry laurels of worst movie ever made from that Lovecraftian abomination.Manos must have put good directors like Kubrick or Capra in convulsions during its production: so powerful is the elemental force of badness flowing from every stinking pore of its perverse form. It is the polar opposite to the good movie, the parameters of its illogicity and non-acting existing to defy the borders of taste, and ultimately, sanity. Every grainy, scratchy, blurry frame of the muddy color palette and every sound byte of the poorly synchronized and terribly dubbed dialog offers an entrancing glance into a deeper, darker world of madness that is Manos the Hands of Fate. It is not of this earth. It is not of our dimension. Surely Hal P. Warren was some malfeasant alien god from a realm far removed from our own, hurtling across the icy chasms of space with a vile mission in store for the unsuspecting members of the cinematic world.Its legacy, however, lives on in the form of Mystery Science Theater. The acid-tipped barbs flew fast and furiously, striking the venerable beast in its countless weak points, crafting from the chaos a comedic gem that approaches cinematic perfection stamped into the world of movies in its own stinking ichor. This is Manos: Hands of Fate. This is the purifying baptism of fire that scourges the detestable vestiges of mediocrity and normalcy from the mainstream viewer and forever makes them a member of the cult world, the world of bad movies and weirdness that cannot be imagined. It is the cornerstone, the figurehead, the mighty totem representing everything that Mystery Science Theater and the legions of bad movie sites across the Web hold dear to their hearts.Rejoice, connoisseurs of bad movies! Fall upon the dark altar of Manos to pay homage to Torgo and the Master, and forever remember the twisted legacy they wrought from the tangled celluoid!

1.0,I was warned but I watched anyway,"Lost in the desert, a couple, their young daughter and doomed poodle Peppy take shelter in a mysterious house that is watched over by Torgo (John Reynolds), a deformed (and possibly satyric) handyman who ominously (and frequently) refers to the ""Master"". Soon the malignant master (Tom Neyman), with his evil hell-hound, manifests, intending to add the terrified family to his cult of murderous followers (or something to that effect). The femto-budgeted, near-amateur production dominates the top of the bottom of the charts of 'bad movies' as it massages incompetent direction, inept filming and editing, an incoherent plot, insipid acting, soporific pacing, and cretinous script into a preposterous film known only for its awfulness. Lacking the goofy charm of typical 'bad movies', 'Manos' is watchable only as a curiosity or a 'how-not-to' instructional video for aspiring film-makers and, like most of its bottom-of-the-barrel ilk, a lot has been written about the film's provenance, myriad continuity errors, and production flaws. The movie's only redeeming factors are The Master's striking red and black hand-themed cape, shambling minion Torgo's intriguing walking stick, and the ultimate dark fate of the innocent family (in other circumstances, the final scene could have been genuinely creepy).",i was warned but i watched anyway,lost desert couple their young daughter doomed poodle peppy take shelter mysterious house that is watched over by torgo john reynolds deformed possibly satyric handyman who ominously frequently refers master soon malignant master tom neyman with his evil hell hound manifests intending add terrified family his cult murderous followers or something that effect femto budgeted near amateur production dominates top bottom charts bad movies as it massages incompetent direction inept filming editing incoherent plot insipid acting soporific pacing cretinous script into preposterous film known only its awfulness lacking goofy charm typical bad movies manos is watchable only as curiosity or how not instructional video aspiring film makers like most its bottom barrel ilk lot has been written about films provenance myriad continuity errors production flaws movies only redeeming factors are masters striking red black hand themed cape shambling minion torgos intriguing walking stick ultimate dark fate innocent family other circumstances final scene could have been genuinely creepy,0.6175,-0.0236111111111111,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.18}"
1.0,Not as bad as I hoped...,"'Manos' The Hands of Fate is highly regarded by many as one of the worst, if not the worst movie ever made. As a fan of terrible movies, I bought a DVD of the original version, however I was disappointed with the high quality of this movie.Why isn't this the worst movie ever? It makes a few classic mistakes: Firstly, it's obvious from the start that this movie is utter tripe; an excellent terrible movie will start out with great promise, and dig a bottomless pit. Secondly, one actor in the film is reasonably good; an excellent terrible movie will be sure to select untalented individuals of the same caliber. Thirdly, some scenes are so terrible they are funny; an excellent terrible movie has no funny scenes, and should lead to feelings of resentment, and anger. Finally, the plot (stranded family spends the night with a cult group) is somewhat consistent; an excellent terrible movie will have no plot, forget it's plot, or jump incongruously from scene to scene. In all fairness, Manos has a number of irrelevant scenes, but the main plot is consistently maintained.Some general shortcomings of this movie: It suffers from extremely poor editing, some of the worst I've seen; Most of the movie is boring; It is not scary, this is supposed to be a horror film; The acting is poor, with the exception of Tom Neyman, who was decent; The music is repetitious.I'm afraid that I can do no better than lump this movie in the worst top 5 I've seen, which still earns it a solid 1 / 10.Movies that I consider worse than this: Ironheart (the only movie that makes me furious for wasting time watching it; overall worst movie); Glen or Glenda (excruciatingly boring; worst plot); Delta Force Commando (by far the worst acting, worst special effects); Starship (excruciatingly boring)",not as bad as i hoped,manos hands fate is highly regarded by many as one worst if not worst movie ever made as fan terrible movies i bought dvd original version however i was disappointed with high quality this movie why isnt this worst movie ever it makes few classic mistakes firstly its obvious start that this movie is utter tripe excellent terrible movie will start out with great promise dig bottomless pit secondly one actor film is reasonably good excellent terrible movie will be sure select untalented individuals same caliber thirdly some scenes are so terrible they are funny excellent terrible movie has no funny scenes should lead feelings resentment anger finally plot stranded family spends night with cult group is somewhat consistent excellent terrible movie will have no plot forget its plot or jump incongruously scene scene all fairness manos has number irrelevant scenes but main plot is consistently maintained some general shortcomings this movie it suffers extremely poor editing some worst ive seen most movie is boring it is not scary this is supposed be horror film acting is poor with exception tom neyman who was decent music is repetitious im afraid that i can do no better than lump this movie worst top 5 ive seen which still earns it solid 1 10 movies that i consider worse than this ironheart only movie that makes me furious wasting time watching it overall worst movie glen or glenda excruciatingly boring worst plot delta force commando by far worst acting worst special effects starship excruciatingly boring,0.692030525030525,-0.17958241758241755,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.24}"

10.0,How many people have even seen this movie?,"From reading the reviews for this movie (which is right now #12 on the bottom 150 films), I can tell that less than 1% of the people who reviewed this have even seen the complete un-MST'd ""Manos the Hands of Fate"". Well, I may stick out like a sore thumb, but I liked this movie. Not enough to watch it over and over and over again, but I think that the fact that its low budget helped it be a little creepy. It has a documentary-like quality that makes it look eerily like a snuff film. The bizarre music, the bad lighting, the average acting, Torgo's sickening costume, and the strange dubbing help make it one of the more intriguing low-budget films of the 60s. That's right, I liked this movie, it didn't bore me very much, and I would watch it again. You can watch the MST3K version of ""Manos"", but you'll lose a great deal of the movie and its atmosphere. Give it a try without MST3K (who also ruined ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"", ""Revenge of the Creature"", ""Squirm"", and several other underrated classics), you just might be surprised.

8.0,Underrated little oddball gem,"I've long been fond of horror delving into America's weird interior. The spectacle of city-folk burrowing unknowing into uncharted realms where all their order, their civility means nought, where even sanity has made little purchase, these journeys fascinate me. So it is the case with Manos, a notorious film and one of the stranger examples of its genre. It tells of a happy family, Michael, Margaret and daughter Debbie on their way to a countryside lodge, one which may not even exist. They lose their way and end up at a mysterious domicile run by the anxious, strange walking, staff bearing Torgo, and as their tale unfolds they come to know the nature of the place and regret ever stopping there. Manos wields a strange power, and I think it comes from the way in which the fearful foundations of the plotting find their oddity echoed in the construction of the piece. The film dwells on primal fears of the unknown, of dislocation from ones usual milieu and ultimately of the break from ones one control. Whilst other films might array a number of editing tricks and a spot of meaningful dialogue to convey such fearful atmosphere Manos relies on guileless amateurism and succeeds precisely because of its lack of control. The audience knows anything can happen, that the film lacks reason and control, so the perfect conditions are established for the films effect. Which is not to say that there aren't some legitimate qualities at work here. The score mixes simple but menacing riffs with good looser moments, piano that sometimes ripples and sometimes spikes and some tensely thudding percussion, it has quite a potent presence. There are interesting images too, Torgo approaching with his staff penetrating the frame from bottom left, Torgo holding his master at bay, his staff playing back and forth in front of the Master's face, wives bound to pillars like living statues and so on. Best of all comes when the wives arise, their depiction has a playful art to it, they are something like an insane Greek chorus. Performances are decent too, Hal Warren has a perfect stolid and dull presence as Michael, Diane Mahree appropriately perturbed as Margaret, while Tom Neyman is wondrously campy yet menacing as The Master. Best of all though is John Reynolds as Torgo, his pained and fretful weirdness exerts a powerfully strange hold. Production design is simple yet weird, and the dark cinematography works well in creating a bleak, unsettled atmosphere. I guess this one has put a lot of people off since it currently holds the no. 2 spot in IMDb's bottom 100 but to me it was a real treat. It might best be called anti-art since it was made by a fertiliser salesman for a bet, but whatever its genesis I think its something of an off the wall gem with only a few moments of blatant ineptitude (like a visible clapper-board) to spoil the fun.
