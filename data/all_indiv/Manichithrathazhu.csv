10.0,One of the best Indian movies,"This has got to be one of the best movies both in malayalam and in India. superb script combined with beautiful direction and acting has made this movie a treat to watch. I have watched this one numerous times..don't even remember the number. As many I was also disappointed to see its remake in other languages. I think they spoiled the beautiful concept and feel of this movie.

,One of the greatest Malayalam movies ever made,"The first half of Manichithrathazhu may be slow, but the second half becomes gripping. The amazing climax, featuring Shobana's spectacular dance with her partner, pushes this movie from a simple Malayalam thriller to the level of high art. Although the film isn't perfect--there are minor plot holes, and Mohanlal's entertaining performance goes over the top in some scenes--Manichithrathazhu is one of the best Indian movies I've seen.After watching this movie, I couldn't believe it was directed by Fazil, the same guy who churned out overly sentimental mush like Aniyathi Pravu (1997) and shameless, cookie-cutter Hollywood remakes like Life Is Beautiful (2000). Manichithrathazhu has to be the high point of Fazil's career.After a lifetime of avoiding most Malayalam movies like the plague, old classics like this film are turning me into a big fan of Malu films. Also, after watching his charismatic performances in films like Nadodikattu (1987), Pattana Pravesham (1988), Akkare akkare akkare (1990), and Manichithrathazhu, I find myself becoming an enthusiastic fan of Mohanlal. If you're not already a Mohanlal fan, watching Manichithrathazhu may make you one.",one greatest malayalam movies ever made,first half manichithrathazhu may be slow but second half becomes gripping amazing climax featuring shobanas spectacular dance with her partner pushes this movie simple malayalam thriller level high art although film isnt perfect there are minor plot holes mohanlals entertaining performance goes over top some scenes manichithrathazhu is one best indian movies ive seen after watching this movie i couldnt believe it was directed by fazil same guy who churned out overly sentimental mush like aniyathi pravu 1997 shameless cookie cutter hollywood remakes like life is beautiful 2000 manichithrathazhu has be high point fazils career after lifetime avoiding most malayalam movies like plague old classics like this film are turning me into big fan malu films also after watching his charismatic performances films like nadodikattu 1987 pattana pravesham 1988 akkare akkare akkare 1990 manichithrathazhu i find myself becoming enthusiastic fan mohanlal if youre not already mohanlal fan watching manichithrathazhu may make you one,0.564569597069597,0.3206410256410257,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Best movie I have seen,"Manichitratazu is a very great Classical movie which I have ever seen. The portrayal of human psychology is marvelous. The movie plot is thrilling, mystic and powerful. Fantastic performances by all actors like Mohan Lal, Shobana, Vinaya Prasad, Suresh Gopi, Innocent, Nedumudi Venu, etc. Shobana's dancing skills is excellent and also good powerful acting by her and she rightfully deserves the national award.

10.0,A rare masterpiece,"One Excellent masterpiece. This is one of the rare movies where the story can be interpreted in two ways. One way is to believe that Ganga is possessed by Nagavalli the dancer's spirit. The other is to assume that she is suffering from multiple personality disorder. The movie has arguments for both. The psychiatrist's explanations and predictions and his ability to solve the problem leaves most of the audience believing in the MCD theory. But Nagavalli fans point to the famous dance scene where Ganga's eyes change colour, and the scenes where she breaks objects like the clock which seemed quiet impossible to most. This reinforces the possession theory. Probably this is the first Indian movie to feature MCD. Highlights of the movie are the scene where Ganga gradually evolves into Nagavalli and her Malayalam changing into chaste Tamil, and the bharatanatyam dance sequence. It also has an unique song sung in a sad tone: 'pazham thamizh pattu'. Urban legends say the song's vaadi raga is unlucky, almost like gloomy Sunday and macbeth. Although made more than 13 years ago, it still glues you to the seat. two remakes were done on the movie. the kannada version was good though it didn't match the original. A tamil version was poor and twisted.",rare masterpiece,one excellent masterpiece this is one rare movies where story can be interpreted two ways one way is believe that ganga is possessed by nagavalli dancers spirit other is assume that she is suffering multiple personality disorder movie has arguments both psychiatrists explanations predictions his ability solve problem leaves most audience believing mcd theory but nagavalli fans point famous dance scene where gangas eyes change colour scenes where she breaks objects like clock which seemed quiet impossible most this reinforces possession theory probably this is first indian movie feature mcd highlights movie are scene where ganga gradually evolves into nagavalli her malayalam changing into chaste tamil bharatanatyam dance sequence it also has unique song sung sad tone pazham thamizh pattu urban legends say songs vaadi raga is unlucky almost like gloomy sunday macbeth although made more than 13 years ago it still glues you seat two remakes were done movie kannada version was good though it didnt match original tamil version was poor twisted,0.6469298245614034,0.1635964912280702,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9.0,Excellent,"This was one movie which really impressed me in 1993. Writing a review after so many years is a proof of how much sense it makes to me even today. Malayalam movies are always ahead of the rest of the country in making meaningful and realistic stories. That too on quarter of the budget a Bollywood movie is made with. This movie was a masterpiece work from Fazil. This movie also had another 6 A list directors doing diff segment of this movie, like the comedy part was done by Priyadashan. This movie was later made into a Tamil, Kannada and Telungu all which turned out to be super duper hits. Plans are in the pipeline to remake it in Hindi. But the essence of the movie is being lost in the translation. The 1993 Malayalam version is the best yet. This movie was well made and well received my all the generations of Keralites.

You will enjoy it much more and realize why the original will always be the best. There was also a few sequels made like Kannada Apthamitra and Telugu Nagavalli.

10.0,Evergreen Gem of Malayalam cinema.,"One of the greatest thriller ever made in India & also among my most gratifying movie ever i had seen. No doubt story by Madhu muttam is the real hero & performance by all actors were magnificent especially Shobana(won national award). Shobana was scintillating & showcase a do or die performance. 1st half is enriched with comedy & little horror. 2nd half is nail biting taut thriller leads to fiery climax. There is no point in criticizing this masterpiece despite of its length. Music was both nostalgic & horrifying(climax). BGM by Johnson is brilliant which taken film to another dimension. Performance,Script,Music,Bgm,Cinematography,Direction,Make-up and Art department etc. were par excellence. Manichitrathazhu is one of the rare thriller which provide wholesome entertainment to the viewers in large quantity. There is no unnecessary scene and so its a 100% Impeccable masterpiece ever an Indian cinema produced. After premiering on T.V many times i never get bored watching again & again.

8.0,Manichitrathazhu expands the limits of Psychological-Horror-Thriller genre not only for Indian Cinema but also for Global Cinema.,"Manichitrathazhu (1993) : Brief Review -Manichitrathazhu expands the limits of Psychological-Horror-Thriller genre not only for Indian Cinema but also for Global Cinema. Suppose we are all in the year 1993, and try to understand this review as per the time and then you'll understand it perfectly and it won't even sound like an exaggeration. By 1993, Hollywood had One Classic Psychological thriller made, that's 'Silence Of The Lambs' (1991) and even that film does not have any unexpected revelations in the climax like Manichitrathazhu. Hollywood had stunning climaxes in Psychological Thriller genre with 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Fight Club' but these films came after 5-6 years of Manichitrathazhu. The same applies to Foreign Language Cinema (except for Bergman's Persona in 1966) and Indian Cinema. Just try to remember what kind of thrillers India was making or Hollywood was making by 1993 and then have a look at this Cult Classic Malayalam Flick. Manichitrathazhu truly is an pioneer of this new genre where horror elements are mixed up with Psychological Thrilling elements and the cumulative result of it leaves each an every viewer amazed, shocked, scared and boggled. What a cracking storyline it was for its time. Who would though of such a groundbreaking script then? I mean people were happy to see just a thriller or a psychological drama or a horror film and then Manichitrathazhu came up with a combined effects of all of them. OMG! There is not a single wrong thing in the film. The humour, the writing, the acting, the overwhelming ideas, stunning visuals, impeccable direction and what not. The film has been remade multiple times for a reason, right? Just prefer the original and this is certainly the Most Stunning Experience in the entire 90s decade.

8.0,Amazing performances.,Such great performances! More real and believable than the Hindi remake Bhool Bhulaiyaa but I must admit I enjoyed Bhool Bhulaiyaa more than Manichitrathazhu because - 1. The story was new for me so while watching Manichitrathazhu there's no suspense. 2. I was able to appreciate when they used Bengali but in Manichitrathazhu when they used Tamil I was not able to appreciate it because to me Malayalam & Tamil sounds similar. 3. The comedy in Manichitrathazhu is subtle & I enjoy Priyadarshan-Akshay style more. (or maybe it's just the language barrier)I think I have seen Bhool Bhulaiyaa far too many times to the point I remember all characters' name & dialogues.

9.0,"if i have to choose 5 great movies.this is one of them.a must watch.never go for its remakes,they are all scraps.","The story of this movie is very unique and has not been told before. First we thought it is a supernatural story, but as we understood the dual personality of Shobhana we got very interested in this character and how she would be able to get out of her predicament. The characters in the movie, Sunny Joseph, Nakulan, Ganga, Ammavan are all memorable and have been portrayed with realism.Even though this is a ghost movie, there are no special effects. Director Fazil uses simple tricks like shadows on the wall and sounds to heighten the tension. In one scene, the whole family goes to watch a Kathakali performance. Sunny sits in the front and occasionally turns back to see if Ganga is alright. The sound of the drums heighten in the background. Then, once when Sunny turns back, there is silence and Ganga is not there. The intensity of the scene is heightened by the lack of any background sound, which we thought was a very innovative but subtle technique.In this movie, the script by Madhu Mattom is the hero and Shobhana is the heroine. Shobhana had two roles, one as the mild mannered Ganga and the other as the revenge seeking Nagavalli. It during the Nagavalli phase that you see her transformation, in her voice and in her mannerism. Shobhana won a truly deserved National Award for this role.Mohanlal makes his entry just before the interval, which is unconventional. From that point onwards, it is his show and the character he portrays is that of a fun loving psychiatrist. He is unconventional in his treatment style also. Mohanlal does not have much histrionics in this movie and plays a very subdued role.For a movie which is a psycho-thriller, it has excellent comedy provided by Innocent, Lalitha and Mohanlal himself.The story, screenplay and dialogue is by Madhu Mattom and we liked all three of them. There are no unnecessary scenes in this movie and each scene in the screenplay sustains our interest in the story. We also are impressed by the craft of director Fazil for making this movie very interesting. The movie also had a second unit by directors Sathyan Antikkad and Priyadarshan. M.G.Radhakrishnan has provided some memorable music for this movie. All the songs are nice to hear, but our favourite is Palavattom Pookalam This movie is one of our favourites and is a must watch.",if i have choose 5 great movies this is one them must watch never go its remakes they are all scraps,story this movie is very unique has not been told before first we thought it is supernatural story but as we understood dual personality shobhana we got very interested this character how she would be able get out her predicament characters movie sunny joseph nakulan ganga ammavan are all memorable have been portrayed with realism even though this is ghost movie there are no special effects director fazil uses simple tricks like shadows wall sounds heighten tension one scene whole family goes watch kathakali performance sunny sits front occasionally turns back see if ganga is alright sound drums heighten background then once when sunny turns back there is silence ganga is not there intensity scene is heightened by lack any background sound which we thought was very innovative but subtle technique this movie script by madhu mattom is hero shobhana is heroine shobhana had two roles one as mild mannered ganga other as revenge seeking nagavalli it during nagavalli phase that you see her transformation her voice her mannerism shobhana won truly deserved national award this role mohanlal makes his entry just before interval which is unconventional that point onwards it is his show character he portrays is that fun loving psychiatrist he is unconventional his treatment style also mohanlal does not have much histrionics this movie plays very subdued role movie which is psycho thriller it has excellent comedy provided by innocent lalitha mohanlal himself story screenplay dialogue is by madhu mattom we liked all three them there are no unnecessary scenes this movie each scene screenplay sustains our interest story we also are impressed by craft director fazil making this movie very interesting movie also had second unit by directors sathyan antikkad priyadarshan m g radhakrishnan has provided some memorable music this movie all songs are nice hear but our favourite is palavattom pookalam this movie is one our favourites is must watch,0.5704241071428572,0.3351748511904762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.27}"
