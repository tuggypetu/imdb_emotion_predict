5.0,Meandering is right,"MIDSOMMAR is the latest film from arthouse director Ari Aster, whose HEREDITARY wowed audiences a few years ago. While I liked that film I didn't love it, but I do love folk horror and THE WICKER MAN so I expected a lot from this one. Sadly, I didn't get it. MIDSOMMAR is a real mixed bag of a movie, with a decent first half. Florence Pugh gives a fine performance and the opening sequence is particularly powerful, getting off to a good footing. The slow-burning suspense works effectively until the genuine shocks of the 'cliff' sequence, but after this things really stop working. There's the usual sex and violent content, but it all feels very meandering and dragged out, saddled with unlikeable characters and a genuine lack of meaning and narrative cohesion. The cinematography is great and the actors certainly do their best, but by the end I felt this had become predictable, random (Viking execution methods for shock value, etc.) and a bit like a boring slasher film.",meandering is right,midsommar is latest film arthouse director ari aster whose hereditary wowed audiences few years ago while i liked that film i didnt love it but i do love folk horror wicker man so i expected lot this one sadly i didnt get it midsommar is real mixed bag movie with decent first half florence pugh gives fine performance opening sequence is particularly powerful getting off good footing slow burning suspense works effectively until genuine shocks cliff sequence but after this things really stop working theres usual sex violent content but it all feels very meandering dragged out saddled with unlikeable characters genuine lack meaning narrative cohesion cinematography is great actors certainly do their best but by end i felt this had become predictable random viking execution methods shock value etc bit like boring slasher film,0.5568555008210181,0.13850574712643682,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.25}"
4.0,Not for everyone,"Let me first say, this is not a ""bad"" movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn't like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn't appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you.",not everyone,let me first say this is not bad movie it utilizes creative camera work cinematography add narrative but i personally still didnt like it its main goal my opinion is disturb viewer as much as possible through use sound gory visuals feeling isolation insanity while i can see how this can speak certain audience it didnt appeal me made me want turn movie quite few times if you are into these kinds films definitely give this try but if you like me enjoy being scared by horror movie instead weirded out disturbed this might not be you,0.5587301587301586,0.13174603174603172,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"
3.0,Midsommar murders.,"Spurred on by his friends, anthropology student Christian (Jack Reynor) is on the verge of breaking up with his girlfriend Dani (Florence Pugh), but a family tragedy for Dani changes his mind. Feeling guilty about putting his girlfriend through further emotional trauma, Christian asks her to accompany him and his pals on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the remote ancestral village of their Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren), who has invited them take part in the commune's nine-day midsummer festival.Director Ari Aster (Hereditary) might claim that Midsommar only pays homage to brilliant UK folk horror The Wicker Man, but all I can see is a blatant, bloated and extremely tedious rip-off. Where The Wicker Man (Director's Cut) runs at a reasonable 99 minutes, its engrossing story whisking the viewer along as Edward Woodward's character attempts to solve a mystery on a remote Scottish island, Aster's film (The Director's Cut) takes a whopping 171 minutes to tell its very familiar tale of unwary outsiders falling foul of an strange religion that practises bizarre rituals.Moving at a snail's pace, the first hour of Midsummar is a massive challenge for the viewer, as the students travel to the village of the Hårga, meet the locals, and take part in ancient rites which involve lots of chanting and taking of hallucinogens. Those who make it through this tedium will eventually be rewarded with a shocking scene that is the equivalent of Hereditary's decapitation (ie., it's designed to wake up the viewer and become a talking point): before the eyes of the horrified students, elders of the village throw themselves off a precipice, falling onto the rocks below with very messy results.Anyone hoping that this will herald a turning point in the film will be sorely disappointed: the dull drama continues, with an excess of singing, dancing and a glut of aerial overhead shots, with hints of weirdness to indicate where the film is heading (as if we didn't know already). As Christian's friends go missing one-by-one, and the locals become increasingly weird in their behaviour, neither he nor Dani question the wisdom of remaining in the village, both continuing to partake in the commune's activities. A bit of ritualistic sex and the sight of a bloke with his lungs pulled out of his back are about the film's only other noteworthy moments before the whole boring mess finishes in inevitable fashion, stealing its fiery climax from... you guessed it.... The Wicker Man.In short, what a load of (Swedish meat)balls!

10.0,Summer time,"Let's get right into it. The movie will divide viewers. Actually some might not even read what I'm typing right now, dismissing or liking my review just based on the score I gave it. I'm not complaining or trying to get your attention. I gave this a 10/10, something that many would consider sacred (like how some people view trees or other things). But I think the movie deserves it. And while I watched the theatrical version in cinemas, I did watch the Directors Cut the other day too to get a complete picture - no pun intended.Now I know that pacing will be an issue for some - this takes its time and those expecting horror or their version of horror, will have quite a few issues with the movie. Especially in the long version (almost 3 hours). But the framing, the pictures you get are worth it. I would argue that if you ask Ari, why he chose that or this angle, why he lingered on that shot, why he used special effects that are subtle and almost not unnoticeable ... he will be able to answer them. He probably won't, letting you decipher and decide what you just watched, but he had a plan. He really knows his stuff.Now that doesn't mean that you will like the movie. Just because it is made with love and care and attention to every detail, does not make it invincible. It is a taste thing - what do you like to watch in movies. Subtle horror, that is also a drama? Nods to classics like Wicker Man? Will you hate this because to heighten things it takes creative liberty? I don't know if the sun thing (allegedly some claim it is positioned wrong geographically) is a mistake or actually another detail, to make this even more eerie. The costumes may not be traditional, but what the village people do, hopefully isn't traditional either ... if you get hung up on those things, you would be missing the bigger picture. This is not here to critisize or make fun of swedish traditions. This is here to entertain and to hold the viewers suspense - edge of the seat kind of stuff.So yes this isn't your regular horror movie and it is better for it. And while there is not much violence in it (on screen), the occasional outbursts are really spiking! This is not for the faint hearted or the easily offended ... be aware and have the strong stomach to get through it. This is beautiful and horrifying at the same time and really demands to be seen many times - every time you do, you will discover something new!

8.0,"A surreal, but pretty awesome trip.","Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved. The second half is very trippy, and we delve into the world of pagan ritual and bizarre rights, which makes The Whicker Man look like a tea party.The main leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, were terrific. Pugh had impressed previously in The Little Drummer Girl, it was obvious she was destined for big things, she played Dani with a real sense of torment, very impressive. The cast had a realism, it was refreshing not to watch a cast that look set for a Dior catwalk.It won't be for everyone, and I must point out that some scenes are painfully long, needlessly. Some amazing special effects.Violence and nudity, but neither are gratuitous or simply for shock.

10.0,"Traumatic, Surreal, Bizarre Masterpiece","I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of ""That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind."" I suggest that audiences take this advice.PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory.

9.0,An Operatic Catharsis On Emotional Dependency,"""I have always felt held. By a family... a real family. Do you feel held?""One of the most universal and innately human desires is a sense of belonging. The human brain is not meant to be alone; we are evolved to be a part of something. Belonging fundamentally allows us to form our own sense of identity, establish social connections through community, and provides us with love, attention, security, and purpose. Perhaps more importantly, a lack of belonging is when we begin to lose sense of ourselves and who we are. This loss of touch with who we are when the world around us suddenly disappears... this slight loss of footing, dip in reality, always feeling somewhat displaced and perpetually unsettled... this encapsulates the mood of Ari Aster's Midsommar.Aster has delivered a psychedelic genre-defying horror fable that wins its audience by creeping into our darkest corners of angst, longing, and loneliness. At its core, the film is about a young woman who copes with crippling anxiety rooted in a desperate and fearful need for love as she comes to terms with the end of a relationship. It's about anxiety, fear of abandonment, and moving on. It is a meditation on human belonging; an operatic catharsis played on the strings of emotional dependency; a journey both inward and outward, to finally let go of something that was never meant to be.Midsommar is not a mystery or suspense movie. It unveils itself unapologetically, as if the filmmaker has no intention of hiding anything from us in the first place (the entire movie is visually depicted almost constantly in the background on walls or tapestries). Yet the film establishes its own rhythm and pacing. As the characters embark on a mushroom trip and grow weightless and spacey, so do we get entranced by the beautiful Swedish settings and sounds-at times indistinguishable from flutes being played by characters on-screen, and at other times, woven with a spell-binding aural hypnosis (listen to ""Attestupan"" without falling into a meditative trip).Like Hereditary before it, the casting is exceptional. Florence Pugh portrays and embodies isolation and anxiety so effectively that the ideas feel nearly concrete. Her part as Dani demands an incredible range and her commitment to the role is apparent. Her character has an air of desperation to her. A perfect casting for a lonely soul. Jack Reynor, a critical piece to this opera as the unlikeable and detached boyfriend, also delivers in a solid performance that leaves us conflicted, or at the very least, challenged.If Satan and Cannibal Corpse got together to shoot Blue Valentine in Sweden, I'd imagine it would be something like Midsommar. Aster taps into a dark and vulnerable place-he opens the door to chests you may have locked away and have had no intention of coming back to. If you've gone through a break-up recently, it may resonate even stronger. It's uncomfortable, unpleasant, but ultimately, cathartic.The director goes on to describe the film as almost a perverse wish-fulfillment fantasy. You see what you want to see. The inclusion of this overarching idea bears a universal relevance to how we can behave in the midst of the most toxic relationships. Entering the ethereal fog of Hårga perhaps a metaphor for willfully indulging in our clouded judgment to escape our fears.If Hereditary was a thematic exploration of inescapable fate, Midsommar is a tighter, more centered thematic reflection on emotional dependence. The thought given to the characters and script and the details within the various shots, symbols, and sounds will all surely leave many viewers coming back for more.Plan to watch it twice, if for nothing else, to drink the tea again.",operatic catharsis emotional dependency,i have always felt held by family real family do you feel held one most universal innately human desires is sense belonging human brain is not meant be alone we are evolved be part something belonging fundamentally allows us form our own sense identity establish social connections through community provides us with love attention security purpose perhaps more importantly lack belonging is when we begin lose sense ourselves who we are this loss touch with who we are when world around us suddenly disappears this slight loss footing dip reality always feeling somewhat displaced perpetually unsettled this encapsulates mood ari asters midsommar aster has delivered psychedelic genre defying horror fable that wins its audience by creeping into our darkest corners angst longing loneliness at its core film is about young woman who copes with crippling anxiety rooted desperate fearful need love as she comes terms with end relationship its about anxiety fear abandonment moving it is meditation human belonging operatic catharsis played strings emotional dependency journey both inward outward finally let go something that was never meant be midsommar is not mystery or suspense movie it unveils itself unapologetically as if filmmaker has no intention hiding anything us first place entire movie is visually depicted almost constantly background walls or tapestries yet film establishes its own rhythm pacing as characters embark mushroom trip grow weightless spacey so do we get entranced by beautiful swedish settings sounds at times indistinguishable flutes being played by characters screen at other times woven with spell binding aural hypnosis listen attestupan without falling into meditative trip like hereditary before it casting is exceptional florence pugh portrays embodies isolation anxiety so effectively that ideas feel nearly concrete her part as dani demands incredible range her commitment role is apparent her character has air desperation her perfect casting lonely soul jack reynor critical piece this opera as unlikeable detached boyfriend also delivers solid performance that leaves us conflicted or at very least challenged if satan cannibal corpse got together shoot blue valentine sweden id imagine it would be something like midsommar aster taps into dark vulnerable place he opens door chests you may have locked away have had no intention coming back if youve gone through break up recently it may resonate even stronger its uncomfortable unpleasant but ultimately cathartic director goes describe film as almost perverse wish fulfillment fantasy you see what you want see inclusion this overarching idea bears universal relevance how we can behave midst most toxic relationships entering ethereal fog h rga perhaps metaphor willfully indulging our clouded judgment escape our fears if hereditary was thematic exploration inescapable fate midsommar is tighter more centered thematic reflection emotional dependence thought given characters script details within various shots symbols sounds will all surely leave many viewers coming back more plan watch it twice if nothing else drink tea again,0.5001532567049809,0.12186781609195402,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.35}"
4.0,One bad trip.,"'Midsommar (2019)' takes a very long time to get to a very predictable and, frankly, uninteresting point. It's just so slow and, honestly, boring. There's nothing all that engaging about the story, and perhaps its most - or, maybe, only - intriguing thematic aspect is reserved until the very end - the final shot, even. This seems to be as spur-of-the-moment for the film as the decision that leads to it does for the central character. The general theming of the feature isn't all that strong or cohesive and its events don't act as an 'allegory' for the theme, either. This leads to an aimless vibe, a sense of almost making things up as they go along. This creates some issues when everything starts tying together, especially in terms of overall motivation. I mean, some things in here just aren't believable. Plus there's no actual mystery driving the plot, so there's never any tension or suspense. I will say that one sequence is properly horrifying, punctuated by gruesome imagery not for the faint of heart, but it stands as the sole example of something that comes close to getting under your skin and, as such, feels sort of out of place, in a way. It's also brushed off quite quickly, despite being revisited a few times. Still, the film isn't scary. It's not disturbing, either. Most of the 'horror' just comes from the unfamiliarity of the situation - that being a foreign festival presented as a long-held, normalised tradition - from an outside perspective. On top of that, you don't care about the characters - who often make odd, audience-distancing decisions - enough to be affected when things inevitably take a darker turn. That's a bit of an issue. Obviously, the piece is well made, no-one's debating that. It has an effective, if slightly obnoxious, score and makes some distinct visual choices. However, technical competence cannot make up for narrative failure. The opposite of this seems to be the erroneous basis for most of the movie's somehow glowing reviews. Of course, if you really like it, then you like it and that's good for you. I'm just saying that there comes a point where you have to stop awarding, essentially, participation points to well-made but empty fare; most pictures are at least competently constructed and even those that aren't can be enjoyable - or more enjoyable than something like this, at least. The film isn't engaging, entertaining or even close to terrifying, despite its undeniable technical competence. Also, the influences of 'The Wicker Man (1973)' are unmistakable - it actually has quite a bit in common with 'The Wicker Man (2006)', as well. Look, horror doesn't have to scare, as such, but it should do something.

Somehow, they stay together the whole way to summer, when she learns that his Swedish friend Pelle is going home to his commune family for a once in every ninety years ritual and is taking Christian and his friends Mark and Josh.Christian had no intention of telling her about the trip. In fact, his friends want them to break up. But then she's there in Halsingland along with them as they trip out and settle in. Hours later, two of the elders leap off a rock to their deaths, but when the male doesn't die, the others smash his head with a rock.The elder Siv explains that this is how life goes here in Harga, with every member dying in the same way at the age of 72. This would also be the point where anyone sane would get out.Two other guests, Simon and Connie, try to leave but miscommunication separates them. And to top things off, Christian decides to steal Josh's thesis on the Harga. That's when we learn that the commune' runic religion is based on an oracle who is conceived every few years via incest.Oh, where do we go from here? Mark pees on a tree and gets skinned alive. Josh tries to take photos and gets hit with a mallet. Dani takes more drugs and dances around a maypole whole her boyfriend eats pubic hair before impregnating another girl while the rest of the females all watch and push his butt in deeper. Yes, it may have taken Quentin Tarantino a few films before we all realized he has a foot fetish, but Ari Aster took all of one film and a bit of this one to show us that his go-to horror is obese and aged nudity.After finding Christian and Maja having sex, Dani has started screaming and all of the women turn it into a song. I laughed the kind of mad guffaw that Max Cady only reserved for classics like Problem Child. Somehow, this film, much like the last one that Aster essayed, has descended from horror into comedy through no fault of its own.If I told you that the cult members all disembowel a bear and shove Christian into it - get it, his name is Christian and he's being sacrificed? - would you believe me? Well, you better, because that's exactly the kind of ridiculous ending this movie has. Can you believe that some people were upset by this and how intense it supposedly got? Then why was I holding my sides and struggling to breathe as I chuckled with the kind of volume that I had once only thought possible in my wildest dreams?This film is a joke, told with false significance and no small fury, all screaming and yelling and singing and wishing and praying and hoping that someone finds it significant and important and worthy of notice. In short, it is everything that is 2019 - a country that asks for prayers on social media one day and shoots one another in the face the next. A sad moron screaming, ""Notice me.""Somehow, thirty minutes of footage was cut from this movie before release. I have no idea how this is possible, as it felt so ponderous that I fear that it's being over is just a surprise ending and the truth is I will soon wake up and still have forty minutes left to watch. It's the kind of movie that The Lord of the Rings films would tell to wrap it up.There are no surprises. I mean, the opening mural literally tells you everything that will happen in the film. And another piece of art shows a woman falling in love with a man, placing flowers under his pillow and then hiding her pubic hair in his food. This is exactly what Maja does with Christian.There is all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in this film. Every single story beat is so hammered home - yes, that's a horrible pun but this movie in no way makes me want to try - that you become wistful for the simple days of Toni Collette flying around without her head.The funniest thing about this movie is that it sees the Nicholas Cage The Wicker Man as more of an inspiration than the original. That might be all you need to know about this utter turd in the punchbowl.",if this was direct streaming no one would consider it significant,all summer long ive had people breathlessly tell me you need see this movie ive been down this road before it was called hereditary ari asters last film i debated never watching this film but then i reasoned that as much as i detested it follows i loved under silver lake maybe aster would hit paydirt this one after all i love folk horror films like wicker man blood satans claw how bad could it be woah boy dani ardor is dealing with lot her sister has killed her parents then herself this has also pushed her already failing relationship with her boyfriend christian somehow they stay together whole way summer when she learns that his swedish friend pelle is going home his commune family once every ninety years ritual is taking christian his friends mark josh christian had no intention telling her about trip fact his friends want them break up but then shes there halsingland along with them as they trip out settle hours later two elders leap off rock their deaths but when male doesnt die others smash his head with rock elder siv explains that this is how life goes here harga with every member dying same way at age 72 this would also be point where anyone sane would get out two other guests simon connie try leave but miscommunication separates them top things off christian decides steal joshs thesis harga thats when we learn that commune runic religion is based oracle who is conceived every few years via incest oh where do we go here mark pees tree gets skinned alive josh tries take photos gets hit with mallet dani takes more drugs dances around maypole whole her boyfriend eats pubic hair before impregnating another girl while rest females all watch push his butt deeper yes it may have taken quentin tarantino few films before we all realized he has foot fetish but ari aster took all one film bit this one show us that his go horror is obese aged nudity after finding christian maja having sex dani has started screaming all women turn it into song i laughed kind mad guffaw that max cady only reserved classics like problem child somehow this film much like last one that aster essayed has descended horror into comedy through no fault its own if i told you that cult members all disembowel bear shove christian into it get it his name is christian hes being sacrificed would you believe me well you better because thats exactly kind ridiculous ending this movie has can you believe that some people were upset by this how intense it supposedly got then why was i holding my sides struggling breathe as i chuckled with kind volume that i had once only thought possible my wildest dreams this film is joke told with false significance no small fury all screaming yelling singing wishing praying hoping that someone finds it significant important worthy notice short it is everything that is 2019 country that asks prayers social media one day shoots one another face next sad moron screaming notice me somehow thirty minutes footage was cut this movie before release i have no idea how this is possible as it felt so ponderous that i fear that its being over is just surprise ending truth is i will soon wake up still have forty minutes left watch its kind movie that lord rings films would tell wrap it up there are no surprises i mean opening mural literally tells you everything that will happen film another piece art shows woman falling love with man placing flowers under his pillow then hiding her pubic hair his food this is exactly what maja does with christian there is all subtlety sledgehammer this film every single story beat is so hammered home yes thats horrible pun but this movie no way makes me want try that you become wistful simple days toni collette flying around without her head funniest thing about this movie is that it sees nicholas cage wicker man as more inspiration than original that might be all you need know about this utter turd punchbowl,0.48155946458185267,0.07453506278133143,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"

1.0,Midsommar a Miss,"What would you think a movie involving white clothes and head wreaths would be about? If you said creepy pagan rituals then you're right.Unfortunately, Midsommar was about what I thought it'd be about. Pagan rituals. Were the rituals more extreme than--let's say--Wicker Man? Yes. But extreme wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for truly different. Truly scary. This movie wasn't scary it was just disturbing. There were ugly nude bodies, some gore, and overall disturbing ceremonies but it was still a pagan ritual movie.But it was also slow. Exasperatingly slow. Slower than a constipated sloth. There were too many silent mood-setting shots. I've been programmed to know that silent shots in scary movies are for build-up. It's upon the movie maker to deliver on that build up. I can't count how many slow-moving shots in this movie were building up to nothing. I get it. You can't have something ghastly happen every time or it will become mundane. But not at all?When these five friends went to Sweden for a getaway and decided to stop off in some remote village for their nine-day festival you knew something was gonna go down. But did it have to move so slowly and drag on forever? Did the scenes have to last so long? Between crying, moaning, singing, dancing, and panting they added so many nerve-wracking noises. Yeah, they made the movie more disturbing and also more annoying.I remained patient throughout the entire film only to NOT be rewarded for my patience. As I suffered through the main character's neurosis and moping I couldn't help but think, ""There better be gold at the end of this rainbow."" I hate to say it, there was no gold... nor silver, nor copper, or any precious metal.

8.0,Probably going to kill Sweden's tourism industry.,"Midsommar Century 16 Theater Watched 7/16/19Horror is my favorite genre to see done right, because it's so rarely done right. Director and writer Ari Aster had something very special with his first film Hereditary. Perhaps the film most recommended to me in the last few years. I have yet to see it, but after last night's screening of his 2nd and newest feature: Midsommar; I made immediate plans to rectify that.It's easy to just say a group of friends travel to Europe to write their college thesis on European pagan traditions but that would be a disservice to the early story Aster creates. I want to keep the plot description mum, but the early parts of this film are stricken with grief, angst, and some of the most realistic portrayals of gaslighting I've seen on film. These are the emotional bricks the story is constructed on. I never found myself waiting for them to just hurry up and go to Europe because the story is so effectively written and performed.Once they arrive to the small Swedish commune, the entire story starts shifting into something else entirely. We just get a feeling in our gut, all these smiling white people. Their all white garb, white teeth, white hair. It's an uneasy amount of white and cleanliness, positioned on gorgeous green hills speckled with bright blue, red, pink and purple flowers. Aster's use of color brilliantly fills the screen. It's a rather unsettling feeling: all this natural beauty and we can't take comfort in any of it.When we learn about the Midsommar festivities planned it seems like a big party for the students, we in the audience see the madness through the flowers. Things get turned to 11 quickly. We see people jumping to their deaths from towering cliffs, faces get smashed with hammers, faces get cutoff and worn as masks, menstrual blood consumed, incredibly graphic, brutal violence.Tonally it's a trip because there is also so much humor injected into the script. Mainly the joke of the kids freaking out and their smiling, white (oh so white) hosts calming them down; assuring them that this is all merely tradition. Smashing someone's head open with a large mallet is simply setting their willing soul free, it's not a big deal. You see? He likes getting his brains bashed in! It beats growing old in a nursing home! The things these kids get put through are wonderfully dreadful.Midsommar is a splendid display of young talent. Florence Pugh's portrayal of Dani is incredible. Her expressions are mesmerizing, she conveys so much emotion with her face. I felt a little less compelled by her boyfriend Christian played by Jack Reynor. We're very clearly not supposed to like his character, but I didn't like him due to his performance. It felt stiff and at times a little forced. Physically he was perfect for the role, but his delivery and timing left me feeling sort of...meh. Luckily the writing is so strong I never get too caught up in that. Even if one performance feels a little less compelling, the important part is the gang of young friends' performances and personalities work as a whole.Aster's ability to pace a 2-and-a-half-hour film and make it feel short is the genius. Every single scene feels important, there are so many details and carefully crafted instances of foreshadowing. Not heavy handed, but deft and nerve racking. In a time where attention spans are shrinking it's rewarding and refreshing to see a film not only take it's time but to do so in a way that makes the film work even better. It's not self-indulgent, it's vulnerable and enticing. I want to see this one again just to see exactly what he sets up earlier in the film. Midsommar is upsetting, grotesque, beautiful and humorous all at once. It's a great horror film and being as though it's only Aster's 2nd feature, the next step in his career is an exciting thought.",probably going kill swedens tourism industry,midsommar century 16 theater watched 7 16 19horror is my favorite genre see done right because its so rarely done right director writer ari aster had something very special with his first film hereditary perhaps film most recommended me last few years i have yet see it but after last nights screening his 2nd newest feature midsommar i made immediate plans rectify that its easy just say group friends travel europe write their college thesis european pagan traditions but that would be disservice early story aster creates i want keep plot description mum but early parts this film are stricken with grief angst some most realistic portrayals gaslighting ive seen film these are emotional bricks story is constructed i never found myself waiting them just hurry up go europe because story is so effectively written performed once they arrive small swedish commune entire story starts shifting into something else entirely we just get feeling our gut all these smiling white people their all white garb white teeth white hair its uneasy amount white cleanliness positioned gorgeous green hills speckled with bright blue red pink purple flowers asters use color brilliantly fills screen its rather unsettling feeling all this natural beauty we cant take comfort any it when we learn about midsommar festivities planned it seems like big party students we audience see madness through flowers things get turned 11 quickly we see people jumping their deaths towering cliffs faces get smashed with hammers faces get cutoff worn as masks menstrual blood consumed incredibly graphic brutal violence tonally its trip because there is also so much humor injected into script mainly joke kids freaking out their smiling white oh so white hosts calming them down assuring them that this is all merely tradition smashing someones head open with large mallet is simply setting their willing soul free its not big deal you see he likes getting his brains bashed it beats growing old nursing home things these kids get put through are wonderfully dreadful midsommar is splendid display young talent florence pughs portrayal dani is incredible her expressions are mesmerizing she conveys so much emotion with her face i felt little less compelled by her boyfriend christian played by jack reynor were very clearly not supposed like his character but i didnt like him due his performance it felt stiff at times little forced physically he was perfect role but his delivery timing left me feeling sort meh luckily writing is so strong i never get too caught up that even if one performance feels little less compelling important part is gang young friends performances personalities work as whole asters ability pace 2 half hour film make it feel short is genius every single scene feels important there are so many details carefully crafted instances foreshadowing not heavy handed but deft nerve racking time where attention spans are shrinking its rewarding refreshing see film not only take its time but do so way that makes film work even better its not self indulgent its vulnerable enticing i want see this one again just see exactly what he sets up earlier film midsommar is upsetting grotesque beautiful humorous all at once its great horror film being as though its only asters 2nd feature next step his career is exciting thought,0.4774774354186117,0.11648264861500156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"

It is confusing much of the time but when it is all over you realize it is a fable of sorts for the lead character, Dani, to come to some resolution from the loss of her family and coming to terms with her dud of a boyfriend.Look up the entire lyrics of 'Hotel California' by The Eagles, with this movie in mind you can find many parallels.I already was a Florence Pugh fan from her roles in Lady MacBeth (2016) and Fighting With My Family (2019). Here she is Dani who tragically loses her sister and parents, in grief accompanies her boyfriend and three other guys to Sweden in late June to witness, and ultimately participate in, a ritualistic Pagan festival. But it also goes deeper, to the core of the group's beliefs. By the end Dani achieves resolution, the other four are not so fortunate.This is a really strange movie once they get to Sweden, there is very explicit and gory violence, there is a big non-erotic sex scene with a number of nude characters.
