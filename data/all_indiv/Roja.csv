8.0,First part of Mani Ratnam's political trilogy,"This is the first movie of what was to become director Mani Ratnam's ""political trilogy"" (""Bombay"" and ""Dil Se"" being the movies to follow). While not quite as accomplished as the later movies, he develops a very simple story of a young married couple, the subsequent kidnapping of the husband and the wife's attempts to persuade the authorities to help free him into a well-rounded movie that works on almost all levels that it encompasses:The love relationship between the two main characters is credible and well-handled; the struggle of the individual citizen vs. government authorities and individual desires vs. the larger scale of politics is dealt with intensely (the scene where the Colonel tells Roja that ""everyone is happy"" is simply chilling), and even the interplay of the kidnapped and the terrorists works out really well, even if it seems sometimes that Rishi Kumar was lucky ending up with these rather than more ruthless people.The only problem that I have with this movie are a small handful of scenes in which Indian patriotism is showcased in what I felt was a rather blunt manner (but then, coming from a different country, I may lack some essential cultural background to understand it).Apart from this one quibble I think it's a good movie that you should really see, especially I've you've seen Mani Ratnam's other films. Acting is solid, especially from Pankaj Kapoor as the terrorist leader, but also from Arvind Swamy as Rishi (except perhaps when he goes into patriotic overdrive). Also on-screen chemistry between Arvind and Madhoo is fabulous. The music is an early, often charming (""Dil hai chhota sa"") score by A. R.

10.0,"Brilliant content ,Brilliant Score and Brilliant Direction","Seen it ages ago ,still the memories stay as fresh as seen the first time. The deep struggles endured against militants who are humans also are brilliantly depicted in the movie. Well in the original language of the movie the scenes of village girl trying to cope up with the big city and north Indian culture are very vividly depicted by Mani(lost in translation in other languages). With a crew of supremely talented technicians and back ground staff Mani brings us another classic. He should also be credited for getting the best tunes of a innocently brilliant music genius.

9.0,Mani Ratnam at his best!,"I watched this almost after 20 years of its initial release and I regret it that I watched it so late.This is a masterpiece where terrorism is chosen as a topic and mixed up with a romantic drama.

,Well-made film: A turning point in Indian Cinema,"Roja is a film that many feel has been a turning point in Indian cinema. The North, that usually gets all the media hype & coverage in spite of poor techniques and stories got a slap on its face when this Tamil movie was dubbed in Hindi, to enable the larger population to watch this film with a topical theme (of Kashmiri militancy). Movies from the South have always been better in content and form compared to the North. And this movie created that awareness amongst the public there, and its success encouraged many other films to be dubbed in Hindi.And many a star was born:1. Mani Ratnam (who had given better films like Mouna Ragam, Nayakan, Geetanjali and Anjali before)2. A R Rahman aka Dileep Shekar: The man who brought in the New Sound to the Indian film music (lest they forget Music Maestro Ilayaraja's genius, with whom he was a lead keyboard player once) and threat to the copycats of yore: The Annu Maliks and the Anand Milinds3. Santosh Sivan: The cinematographer, now-turned director4. Arvind Swamy: The chubby-cheeked fair-skinned hero who appealed to the color-conscious Northies. And his patriotic fervour was well lapped up.5. Madhoo: The ugly duckling as she was presented in her debut movie was transformed into a lovely and believable Roja- a village belle in awe of the city life and courageous when her life becomes hell with her husband's abduction.What was interestingly presented in the Tamil Original (but lost completely in the Hindi version, as every character speaks Hindi) was the language problem she faces in the North.I watched the film thrice.",well made film turning point indian cinema,roja is film that many feel has been turning point indian cinema north that usually gets all media hype coverage spite poor techniques stories got slap its face when this tamil movie was dubbed hindi enable larger population watch this film with topical theme kashmiri militancy movies south have always been better content form compared north this movie created that awareness amongst public there its success encouraged many other films be dubbed hindi many star was born 1 mani ratnam who had given better films like mouna ragam nayakan geetanjali anjali before 2 r rahman aka dileep shekar man who brought new sound indian film music lest they forget music maestro ilayarajas genius with whom he was lead keyboard player once threat copycats yore annu maliks anand milinds3 santosh sivan cinematographer now turned director4 arvind swamy chubby cheeked fair skinned hero who appealed color conscious northies his patriotic fervour was well lapped up 5 madhoo ugly duckling as she was presented her debut movie was transformed into lovely believable roja village belle awe city life courageous when her life becomes hell with her husbands abduction what was interestingly presented tamil original but lost completely hindi version as every character speaks hindi was language problem she faces north i watched film thrice,0.4771005509641874,0.21074380165289253,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Wow,"This movie gets a 10/10 simply because of its uniqueness but that does not mean that it is not without flaws. I'll get to that later. The terrorism component has been shown very disturbingly. The big flaw I feel is that which the director discovered but failed to exploit fully. I'm talking about the language barriers between the north and south and how frustrating it can be especially in the light of a tragedy. Well he might have actually done more than I can remember because I saw this movie more than a decade ago. The most important thing about this movie that it was AR Rehman's débutant music score, before which he was just doing just music for advertisements. Well done Mani Ratnam for exploiting AR Rehman fully.",wow,this movie gets 10 10 simply because its uniqueness but that does not mean that it is not without flaws ill get that later terrorism component has been shown very disturbingly big flaw i feel is that which director discovered but failed exploit fully im talking about language barriers between north south how frustrating it can be especially light tragedy well he might have actually done more than i can remember because i saw this movie more than decade ago most important thing about this movie that it was ar rehmans d butant music score before which he was just doing just music advertisements well done mani ratnam exploiting ar rehman fully,0.5674744897959184,0.11116071428571428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.21, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,One of Mani Rathnam's greatest movies,"As a Background, this is the first time, we have seen Mani Rathnam write and direct a movie, that involves the conflict of terrorism and more of a global movie (concerning India) rather than Tamil Nadu. When I first saw this movie, I was moved in tears by the story, direction and music. This is by far the best directed movie I have seen by Mani Rathnam (even better than Iruvar), mostly because the story flowed so smoothly and the subtle details that were present, especially when Rishi Kumar (Arvind Swamy) was kidnapped.So to start of with the plot, the story revolves around Rishi Kumar and Roja (Madhoo), who get married in the beginning after many hurdles faced by both of them. Rishi Kumar originally was supposed to marry Roja's sister, but after Roja's sister confessed to Rishi Kumar, that she is in love with someone else, but cannot marry him now, due conflicts between their families. Rishi, then takes the blame for not marrying her, by saying he was in love with her younger sister, Roja. Due to the fact, that Rishi Kumar is well educated, handsome, and holds a good job, they were unwilling to refuse to Rishi Kumar's request, and Roja ends up marrying Rishi Kumar, and her older sister marries the person she loves. Due to Rishi Kumar's rejection of Roja's sister, she resents Rishi Kumar, until he tells her about why he chose to not marry her. After realizing her sister was happy with her husband, she begins to fall in love with Rishi Kumar.Due to the illness of Rishi's boss, Rishi had to take a special project in Kashmir, where he as a cytologist, had a special task of cracking codes from the enemies. Due to the insistence of Roja, Rishi takes Roja with him, to Kashmir. Due to the high profile security around both Rishi and his wife, the terrorist who are demanding freedom for Kashmir, uses this as an opportunity and kidnaps Rishi Kumar, and asks the government to release a terrorist leader, who has killed many, Wasim Khan. Due to the nature of the situation, the government refused to release Wasim Khan for Rishi Kumar. This leads Roja, to plead with the police and the heads of government, to do anything to free her husband. From the pleading of Roja, the government finally allows Wasim Khan to be released, for Rishi Kumar, to the disappointment of head police chief (Nasser), who worked hard to imprison Wasim Khan. Finally in the end, when the exchange was supposed to take place between Wasim Khan and Rishi Kumar, the terrorist just give them clothes of Rishi Kumar, and Wasim Khan was immediately taken back, since the terrorist didn't keep up with their end of the deal. In the end, we realize that the terrorist couldn't hand over Rishi Kumar, since he escaped, and Rishi Kumar faces off with the head terrorist (Pankaj Kapoor), who after many conversations with Rishi Kumar, changed him as a person, and lets him go. The film ends with Rishi Kumar and Madhoo, reuniting at the end.The greatness of this movie is the direction of Mani Rathnam and music by A.R. Rahman. This is by far the best music produced by A.R. Rahman, and from Roja to Slumdog Millionaire, I would say his debut film, Roja, was the best movie, he has made music for. The most moving moments in the movie, are scenes after Rishi Kumar gets kidnapped. When Pankaj Kapoor, tries to make him plead for release of Wasim Khan on a recorder, He refuses and says ""Jai Hind"" and every time he says it, he gets beaten by his guards, until finally they point the gun at him to shoot, and he continues to say ""Jai Hind"", at which moment, Wasim Khan stops them from shooting him. Another good moments from the movie, is the interaction between Roja and the police chief (Nasser), where the police chief doesn't believe that Wasim Khan should be released for a normal citizen like Rishi Kumar, and he should risk his life for the country. To which Roja, asks if he would say the same, if it was the son of the prime minister, or anyone related to someone in power. Also when Roja, confronts Wasim Khan in jail, and asks him why he is trying to kill someone who is innocent, for his personal gain. And further asks him why he doesn't just go to Pakistan, if he does not like India, and stop killing innocent civilians like her husband. The best moment in the movie I believe is the moment, when one of the terrorist guard informs (Pankaj Kapoor) that they have refused to release Wasim Khan, and for the bad news he takes out the flag, and tries to burn it. Rishi Kumar reacts to this by forcefully breaking the window, and jumping over the flag, to extinguish the fire. And he tries to fight off the guards, and finally gets restrained by them. The background music for this scene was well done, and the camera work, where one cannot see the flag, until he burns it, was very well done by Mani Rathnam. Overall the plot, direction, music, make this one of the finest Tamil movies ever taken. The acting by Arvind Swamy and Madhoo was excellent. Overall this is a great movie, especially if you enjoy patriotic movies, like Border, Kargil etc.",one mani rathnams greatest movies,as background this is first time we have seen mani rathnam write direct movie that involves conflict terrorism more global movie concerning india rather than tamil nadu when i first saw this movie i was moved tears by story direction music this is by far best directed movie i have seen by mani rathnam even better than iruvar mostly because story flowed so smoothly subtle details that were present especially when rishi kumar arvind swamy was kidnapped so start with plot story revolves around rishi kumar roja madhoo who get married beginning after many hurdles faced by both them rishi kumar originally was supposed marry rojas sister but after rojas sister confessed rishi kumar that she is love with someone else but cannot marry him now due conflicts between their families rishi then takes blame not marrying her by saying he was love with her younger sister roja due fact that rishi kumar is well educated handsome holds good job they were unwilling refuse rishi kumars request roja ends up marrying rishi kumar her older sister marries person she loves due rishi kumars rejection rojas sister she resents rishi kumar until he tells her about why he chose not marry her after realizing her sister was happy with her husband she begins fall love with rishi kumar due illness rishis boss rishi had take special project kashmir where he as cytologist had special task cracking codes enemies due insistence roja rishi takes roja with him kashmir due high profile security around both rishi his wife terrorist who are demanding freedom kashmir uses this as opportunity kidnaps rishi kumar asks government release terrorist leader who has killed many wasim khan due nature situation government refused release wasim khan rishi kumar this leads roja plead with police heads government do anything free her husband pleading roja government finally allows wasim khan be released rishi kumar disappointment head police chief nasser who worked hard imprison wasim khan finally end when exchange was supposed take place between wasim khan rishi kumar terrorist just give them clothes rishi kumar wasim khan was immediately taken back since terrorist didnt keep up with their end deal end we realize that terrorist couldnt hand over rishi kumar since he escaped rishi kumar faces off with head terrorist pankaj kapoor who after many conversations with rishi kumar changed him as person lets him go film ends with rishi kumar madhoo reuniting at end greatness this movie is direction mani rathnam music by r rahman this is by far best music produced by r rahman roja slumdog millionaire i would say his debut film roja was best movie he has made music most moving moments movie are scenes after rishi kumar gets kidnapped when pankaj kapoor tries make him plead release wasim khan recorder he refuses says jai hind every time he says it he gets beaten by his guards until finally they point gun at him shoot he continues say jai hind at which moment wasim khan stops them shooting him another good moments movie is interaction between roja police chief nasser where police chief doesnt believe that wasim khan should be released normal citizen like rishi kumar he should risk his life country which roja asks if he would say same if it was son prime minister or anyone related someone power also when roja confronts wasim khan jail asks him why he is trying kill someone who is innocent his personal gain further asks him why he doesnt just go pakistan if he does not like india stop killing innocent civilians like her husband best moment movie i believe is moment when one terrorist guard informs pankaj kapoor that they have refused release wasim khan bad news he takes out flag tries burn it rishi kumar reacts this by forcefully breaking window jumping over flag extinguish fire he tries fight off guards finally gets restrained by them background music this scene was well done camera work where one cannot see flag until he burns it was very well done by mani rathnam overall plot direction music make this one finest tamil movies ever taken acting by arvind swamy madhoo was excellent overall this is great movie especially if you enjoy patriotic movies like border kargil etc,0.4991716968477531,0.2213514419852449,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8.0,An early 90s Sensation about Hardcore Patriotism and Hardcore Love..,"Roja (1992) : Brief Review -An early 90s Sensation about Hardcore Patriotism and Hardcore Love. Roja is first of it's kind of theme by Mani Ratnam where he set the love story in the Terrorism atmosphere. He succeeded fulfilling both of them on high note and most importantly he did it positively and without any gimmicks. Roja is a sensation because it came in early 90s, an year before Riot Events took place in India or else the impact and disturbing theme would have fizzled to stand out. And also because Bollywood and South cinema had just started enjoying Masala Films filled with Machoism and Love Triangle based on Sacrifice, but then Roja came with a Love Story set in Sensitive and more realistic atmosphere. Kashmir's backdrop is always sensitive and fragile topic for Indian Movies because if you make just 1 small mistake, only god knows how people are gonna outburst and make it big issue. Fortunately Roja is a safe film cinematically and logically both. The patriotic theme sustains and evokes people to show thier love for the country and at the same time the Love Story runs smoothly. Arvind Swani and Madhoo both provides solid acts and even supporting cast is really good. Roja is truly by all mean a staggering debut for Music Maestro AR Rahman. Each and Every song is Awesome, even the worst case ends at Good. Dialogues are Fantastic, that's it. Kudos for Mani Ratnam for attempting a gutsy product much earlier than expected. He wrote an amazing script and justified it fully with his direction. Probably, the first time Love Story and Patriotism have been bounded together therefore creating a sensational Roja. I hated his 'Dil Se' for the Dumb characterisation but Roja doesn't have anything like that and lives upto all essential elements of Quality Filmmaking. Roja is an early 90s Classic which still manages to hold its impact despite several attempts on same theme.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",early 90s sensation about hardcore patriotism hardcore love,roja 1992 brief review early 90s sensation about hardcore patriotism hardcore love roja is first its kind theme by mani ratnam where he set love story terrorism atmosphere he succeeded fulfilling both them high note most importantly he did it positively without any gimmicks roja is sensation because it came early 90s year before riot events took place india or else impact disturbing theme would have fizzled stand out also because bollywood south cinema had just started enjoying masala films filled with machoism love triangle based sacrifice but then roja came with love story set sensitive more realistic atmosphere kashmirs backdrop is always sensitive fragile topic indian movies because if you make just 1 small mistake only god knows how people are gonna outburst make it big issue fortunately roja is safe film cinematically logically both patriotic theme sustains evokes people show thier love country at same time love story runs smoothly arvind swani madhoo both provides solid acts even supporting cast is really good roja is truly by all mean staggering debut music maestro ar rahman each every song is awesome even worst case ends at good dialogues are fantastic thats it kudos mani ratnam attempting gutsy product much earlier than expected he wrote amazing script justified it fully with his direction probably first time love story patriotism have been bounded together therefore creating sensational roja i hated his dil se dumb characterisation but roja doesnt have anything like that lives upto all essential elements quality filmmaking roja is early 90s classic which still manages hold its impact despite several attempts same theme rating 8 10 by,0.5416294765840222,0.209995867768595,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7.0,"Not Exactly A Terrorist Musical, But Out Of The Ordinary","For U.S.viewers unaccustomed to the mix of escapist musical numbers with disturbing plot content, i.e., a ""terrorist musical,"" Mani Ratnam's romantic drama may prove to be frustrating; with those who are more adventurous, fascinating. Most US films clock in at about 2 hours; most Hindi and Tamil films at about three, and that many hours allow for the inclusion of family drama, romance, singing and dancing in places seemingly unrelated to the plot--in short, a little bit of everything for the time spent.This film is more serious than most of it's kind, dealing with the threat of terrorists (director Ratnam followed it up with a second along the same line, Dil Se) and what a community does about them. My biggest complaint with this film is about the quality of color in the DVD; old Technicolor musicals from Hollywood are restored to an amazing brilliance, while this has been allowed to fade and the film shows the wear of time in print quality. All that said, it's an effective example of it's kind, with several touching performances and a poignant finale.",not exactly terrorist musical but out ordinary,u s viewers unaccustomed mix escapist musical numbers with disturbing plot content i e terrorist musical mani ratnams romantic drama may prove be frustrating with those who are more adventurous fascinating most us films clock at about 2 hours most hindi tamil films at about three that many hours allow inclusion family drama romance singing dancing places seemingly unrelated plot short little bit everything time spent this film is more serious than most its kind dealing with threat terrorists director ratnam followed it up with second along same line dil se what community does about them my biggest complaint with this film is about quality color dvd old technicolor musicals hollywood are restored amazing brilliance while this has been allowed fade film shows wear time print quality all that said its effective example its kind with several touching performances poignant finale,0.461021505376344,0.1614247311827957,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.5}"

6.0,Ok only ...,"But it lacks emotional core of previous Mani Ratnam efforts. This review is like decades late, but I finally got around to see it, especially every now and then the song tune play inside my head. So I just had to see what's the background for a great soundtrack.When you've come out from watching Mani Ratnam's other monumental efforts like Nayagan or Thalapathi, you'd expect similar emotional turbo from subsequent outputs by the movie maker. Unfortunately, no. Partly due to the story itself, which revolves around a love relationship between newly weds played by Around and Madhoo with the background of terrorism in Kashmir. Somehow I didn't quite latch on to that as I did with the former efforts. A love story in the snowy mountains of Kashmir that face a terrorist threat, somehow felt forced. Hence, the dialogue that followed; it just felt somewhat unreal. As a result, one could not expect much emotional attachment to the central characters, although, every one of the actors and actresses do their best with what is given to them. Compare this with Nayagan and Thalapathi, where the story is enhanced by its central characters played by Kamal Hasan and Rajnikanth respectively, combined with great story telling and soundtrack, and you can understand why Roja falls short.",ok only,but it lacks emotional core previous mani ratnam efforts this review is like decades late but i finally got around see it especially every now then song tune play inside my head so i just had see whats background great soundtrack when youve come out watching mani ratnams other monumental efforts like nayagan or thalapathi youd expect similar emotional turbo subsequent outputs by movie maker unfortunately no partly due story itself which revolves around love relationship between newly weds played by around madhoo with background terrorism kashmir somehow i didnt quite latch that as i did with former efforts love story snowy mountains kashmir that face terrorist threat somehow felt forced hence dialogue that followed it just felt somewhat unreal as result one could not expect much emotional attachment central characters although every one actors actresses do their best with what is given them compare this with nayagan thalapathi where story is enhanced by its central characters played by kamal hasan rajnikanth respectively combined with great story telling soundtrack you can understand why roja falls short,0.49889277389277387,0.13344988344988346,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,The Greatest Movie that changed Pan Indian Cinema,"For starters, The movie name "" Roja"" brings goosebumps , such is the impact it had on me as a Cinema lover and made me understand and changed my perspective on how the perfect Movie should be : Engagingly showcasing both visually and with dialogues along with able support from songs, Bgm and Cinematography a story and drama that is unique yet both emotionally gripping and thrilling with a most relevant social theme. Roja is the only movie or at least one of the very few which has all these and some. For once, it is a movie where the fullstop is not after a couple get married and the actual love is established post marriage and shown in the form of a thriller integrated with a national theme brilliantly.The first half is a beautiful depiction of character establishment and drama between different relationships shown subtly with some of the best music and dialogues ever heard and best natural scenery ever seen.The second half the story takes a tremendous turn both story wise and in terms of premise and feel of the movie...The wonderful part if how a national issue was dealt with perfect reality in an national integration form yet the interior layer was a true love story where the wife goes all out for her husband. Its probably the first national integration movie ever and in locations seen for the first time with the lovely thoughts at present reflecting of scenes in the past format ( The one before kaadhal Rojave) , songs both visually and to hear off the charts.So many movies since have used the templates set in Roja and yet none can match the greatest Indian movie ever made by the pairing then that has now conquered the nation as the best - Maniratnam and ARR!!Final Verdict : The best Indian Movie!!",greatest movie that changed pan indian cinema,starters movie name roja brings goosebumps such is impact it had me as cinema lover made me understand changed my perspective how perfect movie should be engagingly showcasing both visually with dialogues along with able support songs bgm cinematography story drama that is unique yet both emotionally gripping thrilling with most relevant social theme roja is only movie or at least one very few which has all these some once it is movie where fullstop is not after couple get married actual love is established post marriage shown form thriller integrated with national theme brilliantly first half is beautiful depiction character establishment drama between different relationships shown subtly with some best music dialogues ever heard best natural scenery ever seen second half story takes tremendous turn both story wise terms premise feel movie wonderful part if how national issue was dealt with perfect reality national integration form yet interior layer was true love story where wife goes all out her husband its probably first national integration movie ever locations seen first time with lovely thoughts at present reflecting scenes past format one before kaadhal rojave songs both visually hear off charts so many movies since have used templates set roja yet none can match greatest indian movie ever made by pairing then that has now conquered nation as best maniratnam arr final verdict best indian movie,0.5434444444444444,0.35144444444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.24}"
