6.0,Good in patches but unnecessary subplots,"I saw the original shortly after its release. Despite the fictional subplot about an Irish spy it is a far better film.Up to the moment that Martin is put in the sea the film is reasonably paced and interesting..

6.0,Perfectly fine,"Operation Mincemeat is a film with very few bells and whistles.It has an interesting story to tell, and it tells it well enough, however unnecessary romantic subplots make the whole thing 20 minutes too long.I think the pacing is a little off as they place the focus too much on the establishment of the plan and not enough on how it pans out.The performances are all fine. Nothing overly flashy. There is a good feel to the film, capturing the period well.Overall a perfectly decent film, worth watching to learn about a remarkable and crucial military operation, but there's nothing particularly remarkable about the filmmaking.",perfectly fine,operation mincemeat is film with very few bells whistles it has interesting story tell it tells it well enough however unnecessary romantic subplots make whole thing 20 minutes too long i think pacing is little off as they place focus too much establishment plan not enough how it pans out performances are all fine nothing overly flashy there is good feel film capturing period well overall perfectly decent film worth watching learn about remarkable crucial military operation but theres nothing particularly remarkable about filmmaking,0.4760317460317461,0.13821428571428573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.22}"
4.0,Disappointing,I was so looking forward to this for the 2 years since i saw them starting filming in 2020 around WhitehallHuge chunks of this film were completely boring and totally unnecessary and these were the stultifying love relationships that took over the plot and in some ways took precedence over the whole point of the film.Ben Mackintires original book was miles away from this effort which - despite the cast - was as boring as hell and could have easily been the thrilling film it should have been leaving out 75% of the personal stories of the characters.The film focussed on the wrong things.What a shame.,disappointing,i was so looking forward this 2 years since i saw them starting filming 2020 around whitehallhuge chunks this film were completely boring totally unnecessary these were stultifying love relationships that took over plot some ways took precedence over whole point film ben mackintires original book was miles away this effort which despite cast was as boring as hell could have easily been thrilling film it should have been leaving out 75 personal stories characters film focussed wrong things what shame,0.7069444444444444,-0.1451388888888889,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"
4.0,Operation hamburger patty,"The main difference between The Man Who Never Was (1956) and this, Operation Mincemeat (2021), is that filmmakers seem to consider 21st century audiences dumb who need everything explained slowly to them. Or, perhaps the filmmakers are such simpletons as they presume their audience to be. Also, it seems that these days the facts, as intriguing as they may be, are not considered enough to make an interesting movie and therefore unnecessary embellishments with invented lies and subplots are deemed a must.The only thing that keeps this movie half-afloat is the regal presence of Colin Firth. The rest is total BS, mostly invented to make the movie drag on for 25 minutes longer than the original.The 1956 original was handicapped by the fact that the facts were still classified and yet they created a brilliantly paced and presented narrative of as close to the truth as they could get. This 2021 outing had all the facts, declassified since 1996, but felt the need to invent fairytales to embellish it with.Is this a good movie to watch if one does not care about the facts it claims to depict?

6.0,Operation brainfreeze,"The production team clearly had an one too many during the making of this. Why anyone would add fiction to spoil a fascinating historical tale is beyond me.Lets recap -- the Brits decieved Hitler through brilliant trickery into diverting his troops, thereby losing ground to the allies, and ultimately losing the war. If this was pure fiction it would be unbelievable or better told with Marvel characters or Tarantino. However, it wasnt fiction!! So why litter the core story with contrived subplots? The relationship between Montague and Jean was nonsense. Unrealistic. Irrelevant. Was it perhaps because someone promised Colin it was a love story to get him involved? Add to this, whilst the script and dialogue was largely good, at times it was awful. These were brainfreeze moments.

6.0,A bit disappointing,The part of the film dealing with the actual operation is fine with good acting and a gripping narrative. Even when one knows historically that the landing in Sicily was a success in the film it still is a breathless moment when everyone is waiting for the news and all the tremendous effort leading up to that moment is effectively conveyed by the director. Unfortunately the movie is marred by the redundant romantic sub-plot which seems like it's from another film and makes the film longer than necessary. The addition of the corpse's fictional sister is also a mistake. It doesn't add anything apart from cheap pathos. The scriptwriter made what could have been a great film into a curate's egg.

,One of the most exciting and consequential covert operations in WWII history.,"Operation Mincemeat is not an animation, but a straightforward, almost romantic depiction of a WWII covert operation, the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, that began the downfall of Adolph Hitler. Churchill, having chased Rommel from N. Africa, now could pick Sicily or Greece to invade, and the Germans were fooled into thinking it would be Greece. By the way, that little plot saved tens of thousands of lives along the way.While bombs and intrigues are war's reality, this enjoyable Netflix docudrama is all about deception, mainly the Allies deceiving, through the use of a dead body, the Nazis into thinking they were invading Europe through Greece. The ""hidden war"" is the clandestine actions of a small British unit dedicated to the biggest case of fake news in WWII.Operation Mincemeat, by virtue of its name, could have appeared silly to serious Nazi operatives, but it did fool them. The film avoids the German point of view while it concentrates on the challenges of faking a real body, stashing real documents on him that wouldn't decay in sea water, and dropping him in a place where it would be easily found.These intriguing choices are equaled by the challenges facing the Brits such as who in the chain of command should know about Operation Mincemeat, besides Churchill, figuring that spies are working among them. Perhaps just as domestically dangerous is the triangle developing between top dog, Ewen Montagu (Colin Firth), and Charles Cholmondeley (Matthew Macfadyen), and new recruit, Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald). That soap opera bogs the film down when so many nuts and bolts of such a delicate operation could be attended to. Yet, war exists on all levels, even the personal.Along the way, one narrator, Ian Fleming (a jaunty Johnny Flynn), has some pre-James Bond wry comments about the proceedings. He does presage Bond by calling two fellow conspirators ""Q"" and ""M."" He is one of several writers to mine the heroics for his fiction. A nice touch for those of us who revere Fleming and Bond.Operation Mincemeat is a detailed exposition of one of history's greatest deceptions. A quiet Netflix night with cognac and chips is just the ticket to marvel at the ingenuity of the Brits and their gambling Prime Minister.

7.0,Operation Mincemeat,"I watched the trailer for this war movie about maybe two months before its actual release, it looked like a fascinating fact-based story, and had a good cast of actors, so I was up for it, directed by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel). Basically, set in 1943 during World War II, British Intelligence are devising a deception operation to keep the plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily secret. Naval intelligence officer Ewen Montagu (Colin Firth) and RAF (Royal Air Force) Flight Lieutenant Charles Cholmondeley (Matthew Macfadyen) have developed an outlandish but intricate plan they are sure will fool the Germans (Nazis) and disguise the invasion. The plan is to dress a corpse as a British officer, give him a fictitious but convincing identity, with personal items, and authentic looking documentation detailing a plan to invade Greece and Sardinia. Admiral John Godfrey (Jason Isaacs) is initially unconvinced that this plan could work, and it will need approval from Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Simon Russell Beale). Slowly however, the plan gets underway, as Montagu and Cholmondeley create an identity and backstory for the fake officer. They give him the name ""Captain (Acting Major) William Martin"", a common and almost undetectable name. Secretary Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald) is fascinated by the plan, named Operation Mincemeat (because of the body). She offers her services into creating a credible identity for the dead man, including using a photograph of herself as the man's lover. The most important part of the operation is to find a dead man, specifically who has recently died from drowning, and eventually they find their man. A man named Glyndwr Michael (Lorne MacFadyen), a tramp who died from eating rat poison, is ""recruited"" for the operation. There is a point when the mission could be stopped when it even starts, when the dead man's sister, Doris Michael (Gabrielle Creevy) identifies his body, but they convince her that his part in their hoax could save many lives. There is also concern that Montagu's brother, Ivor (Mark Gatiss) may be working alongside the enemy, after British intelligence have been tracking his movements and observing his behaviour. Montagu and his team are also unable to photograph the corpse for identity purposes, until Jean introduces them to her American friend, Sergeant Roger Dearborn (Lorne MacFadyen), who is the spitting image of the dead man, and may help them with a new photograph. Slowly, Montagu and Jean find themselves becoming attracted to each other, despite him being married to Iris (Hattie Morahan) and having two children. The operation is coming together, with Hester Leggett (Penelope Wilton) writing a love letter from the sham lover to the dead man, with an eye lash included in the envelope, and a black attaché case chained to his wrist containing the false papers from military authorities in London. Finally, ""William Martin"" is dressed in uniform, placed in an airtight canister, loaded aboard the submarine HMS Seraph, and dropped in the water near Spain. The decomposing corpse is discovered floating off the coast of Huelva, in southern Spain. British intelligence communicates with numerous phone calls claiming to have a lost an officer out at sea, knowing that the Germans are highly likely to be tapping and listening to their telephones. Germans becomes aware of the body washes ashore and use their spies to gain more information about the contents he was carrying. Montagu and the rest of the officers are anxious to find out if the Germans have indeed been fooled by their ruse. Eventually, William Martin is returned to Britain, and MoS (Ministry of Supply) expert Charles Fraser-Smith (James Fleet) investigates the fake letter. He confirms that there is evidence to suggest the wax seal was broken and repaired, indicating the letter was read. Sometime later, the British wait anxiously for a phone call indicating if German forces are moving and the situation with the Allies invading Sicily. Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming (Johnny Flynn) is writing the events as the unfold for a future spy thriller (many aspects of the operation were the inspiration for James Bond). Eventually, the phone rings and it is confirmed that Sicily has been occupied, with very few casualties and little injured during. The deception and Operation Mincemeat are hailed as a success, and Montagu and Cholmondeley are commended for their service. William Martin was laid to rest in a cemetery of Nuestra Señora, in Huelva, Spain, and years later, after the revelation of the mission, his grave was marked with his real name, Glyndwr Michael, and his efforts in the war. Also starring Paul Ritter as Bentley Purchase, Nicholas Rowe as Captain David Ainsworth, Will Keen as Salvador Gomez-Beare, Alexander Beyer as Karl Kuhlenthal, Alex Jennings as John Masterman, Catastrophe's Mark Bonnar as Jock Horsfall, Poldark's Ruby Bentall as Connie Bukes, Nico Birnbaum as Colonel Alexis von Roenne, Markus von Lingen as Adolf Clauss, Rufus Wright as Lieutenant Bill Jewell, Caspar Jennings as Jeremy Montagu, and Dolly Gadsdon as Jennifer Montagu. Firth is good as the gentlemanly leader of the operation, with Macfadyen supporting him well, Macdonald is interesting, and Isaacs is fine. I was told a little about the real story, from the eyelash in the letter to the details of the homeless man chosen, the operation itself is engaging to see planned and unfolding, the characters interacting about the fictional life of their corpse is quirky but likeable, the tiny comedic moments add comic relief, and the period detail is splendid, it is a wonderfully written and performed stranger than fiction British story with gusto, a terrific war drama.

9.0,A truly great film of the quiet heroes of the Second World War,"Truly excellent, the story of how deception played such a key part in the Allies victory. Uniformly terrific performances and a great plot, demonstrating the ""Wilderness of mirrors"" of intelligence work, you can never really be sure of what is real and what is not and have to continually balance one risk against another. The ruthlessness of when the corpse's sister shows up and you have to put your nobler feelings aside because what you're doing is so much more important than her grief at her brother's death, that if you don't carry on there will be thousands of more grieving siblings to mourn for. The heart-stopping scene where the German agent confronts the heroine and you have to consider whether or not to continue, not knowing if there really is an anti-Hitler faction in German intelligence or whether this is all a bluff to make her spill her guts (the fact that he leaves her alive suggests the former). The nagging fear of Communist infiltration which turn out to be 100% true with Philby, Burgess and co. The references to the true inspiration for the plot, ex-British Intelligence chief Basil Thomson (one of the prime architects of the IRA's defeat) and his story ""The Milner's Hat'. In truth the only reason I don't give it 10 out of 10 is that it somewhat exaggerates the impact of the scheme, had it not worked casualties in Sicily would have been far greater but it certainly wouldn't have affected the course of the war and there was no chance of a German invasion of Britain by 1943. But all told a classic spy story that I would recommend to anyone.",truly great film quiet heroes second world war,truly excellent story how deception played such key part allies victory uniformly terrific performances great plot demonstrating wilderness mirrors intelligence work you can never really be sure what is real what is not have continually balance one risk against another ruthlessness when corpses sister shows up you have put your nobler feelings aside because what youre doing is so much more important than her grief at her brothers death that if you dont carry there will be thousands more grieving siblings mourn heart stopping scene where german agent confronts heroine you have consider whether or not continue not knowing if there really is anti hitler faction german intelligence or whether this is all bluff make her spill her guts fact that he leaves her alive suggests former nagging fear communist infiltration which turn out be 100 true with philby burgess co references true inspiration plot ex british intelligence chief basil thomson one prime architects iras defeat his story milners hat truth only reason i dont give it 10 out 10 is that it somewhat exaggerates impact scheme had it not worked casualties sicily would have been far greater but it certainly wouldnt have affected course war there was no chance german invasion britain by 1943 but all told classic spy story that i would recommend anyone,0.49501133786848067,0.18324829931972791,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.38}"
6.0,An interesting film that has much more potential,"A likeable film however I can't help but feel for the potential that it missed out on.

9.0,A Great British Movie,"Operation MincemeatWatched this at the Cineworld Unlimited screening and it was a big surprise. We have now had, quite unbelievably, three brilliant British movies in a row, Duke, Phantom of the Open and now this.Basically the movie showed us a secret spy type mission in WW2 that attempted to dupe the Nazis into believing a military lie and make a strategic mistake. The movie moved with ease from comedy to tragedy and back again with some very serious issues explored with a extraordinarily light touch.The screenplay was simply incredible with great narrative drive and believable characters.I shouldn't say it but it was refreshing that Churchill was portrayed as a corpulent caucasian and we didn't spend 20 minutes trying to guess who this was meant to be, clearly the woke diversity police weren't allowed to racially rinse or gender wash anyone in this movie. It was therefore all surprisingly realistic.The direction was masterful and breathed in all the right places, the actors shone throughout, it was totally an ensemble piece. For a long movie it flew by, I was gripped, even though in reality it was all a very dry subject.I'm giving this a 9 outta 10 for great entertainment, it wasn't perfect by all means and the romantic elements were all a bit stilted but I'm just being picky!",great british movie,operation mincemeatwatched this at cineworld unlimited screening it was big surprise we have now had quite unbelievably three brilliant british movies row duke phantom open now this basically movie showed us secret spy type mission ww2 that attempted dupe nazis into believing military lie make strategic mistake movie moved with ease comedy tragedy back again with some very serious issues explored with extraordinarily light touch screenplay was simply incredible with great narrative drive believable characters i shouldnt say it but it was refreshing that churchill was portrayed as corpulent caucasian we didnt spend 20 minutes trying guess who this was meant be clearly woke diversity police werent allowed racially rinse or gender wash anyone this movie it was therefore all surprisingly realistic direction was masterful breathed all right places actors shone throughout it was totally ensemble piece long movie it flew by i was gripped even though reality it was all very dry subject im giving this 9 outta 10 great entertainment it wasnt perfect by all means romantic elements were all bit stilted but im just being picky,0.5904421768707484,0.22020408163265306,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.43}"
