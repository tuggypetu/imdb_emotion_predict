9.0,Dark Crime Thriller that Thamizh Cinema didn't expect,"After the trailer impressed quiet a number of people, I had an impression that this will be yet another movie which fools around with its trailer. Karthik Naren proved me wrong.Never seen such a dark crime thriller in Thamizh Cinema. I must say, no one expected such a young lad to perform this much.The cinematic dark tone, grippy BGM, Screenplay treatment, Almost perfect Casting, makes this a must watch movie.Although this is not a perfect movie, having its own loopholes, it still stands out from the crowd.Thamizh Cinema is indeed evolving.",dark crime thriller that thamizh cinema didnt expect,after trailer impressed quiet number people i had impression that this will be yet another movie which fools around with its trailer karthik naren proved me wrong never seen such dark crime thriller thamizh cinema i must say no one expected such young lad perform this much cinematic dark tone grippy bgm screenplay treatment almost perfect casting makes this must watch movie although this is not perfect movie having its own loopholes it still stands out crowd thamizh cinema is indeed evolving,0.6023809523809524,0.08214285714285714,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.5, 'Fear': 0.22}"
8.0,One of the best thrillers in recent times in Kollywood.,"D-16, one of the best thrillers in the recent times. Directed by the debutant Karthick Naren. Debutant? Yes, one would wonder how this is possible by a debutant. Karthick directing his first movie has done an exceptional job.The first crime scene might seem average, but there on it's entirely a different movie. Each and every scene is planned to perfection and keeps the audience engaged till the end. Suspense is what Karthick masters, he keeps everyone guessing till it is unraveled.Rahman as Deepak has justified his role. His Malayalam dipped slang might seem a bit unfit but it doesn't over shadow his acting. The story was narrated from Rahman's point of view. Almost all the other faces are new. Everyone has done an exceptional job.Characterization was another plus no unwanted or annoying characters. Every character has contributed something to the plot. The background score by Jakes Bejoy has travelled along the movie that plants each and every scene in mind. Cinematography is another technical aspect that lifts the movie. Sujith Sarang with the camera has to be lauded for his efforts.It's a nail biter one might find travelling along the story till the very end. Karthick is another find for Kollywood. When we leave the movie halls we might still feel suspense circling our heads (Few twists have been left to be judged by the audience).",one best thrillers recent times kollywood,d 16 one best thrillers recent times directed by debutant karthick naren debutant yes one would wonder how this is possible by debutant karthick directing his first movie has done exceptional job first crime scene might seem average but there its entirely different movie each every scene is planned perfection keeps audience engaged till end suspense is what karthick masters he keeps everyone guessing till it is unraveled rahman as deepak has justified his role his malayalam dipped slang might seem bit unfit but it doesnt over shadow his acting story was narrated rahmans point view almost all other faces are new everyone has done exceptional job characterization was another plus no unwanted or annoying characters every character has contributed something plot background score by jakes bejoy has travelled along movie that plants each every scene mind cinematography is another technical aspect that lifts movie sujith sarang with camera has be lauded his efforts its nail biter one might find travelling along story till very end karthick is another find kollywood when we leave movie halls we might still feel suspense circling our heads few twists have been left be judged by audience,0.4448106060606061,0.16473484848484848,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,Must watch thriller,Very good attempt by the upcoming director Karthik. Right from the first scene movie is engaging.Rahman as a police officer has done a great job. No heroism just class. Unusual crime thriller which we don't get to see much in Indian / Tamil cinema. Loved the reference to Mario game of 90s and the magic brick dialogue. Rahman does have a faint Malayalam Accent during the voice over rendering. Very good editing and cinematography. Conclusion in climax doesn't leave much Questions in mind and covers almost all left over bits. All actors have done justice to their roles. I would recommend all to watch this movie as it would be one of the must watch thrillers in tamil history,must watch thriller,very good attempt by upcoming director karthik right first scene movie is engaging rahman as police officer has done great job no heroism just class unusual crime thriller which we dont get see much indian tamil cinema loved reference mario game 90s magic brick dialogue rahman does have faint malayalam accent during voice over rendering very good editing cinematography conclusion climax doesnt leave much questions mind covers almost all left over bits all actors have done justice their roles i would recommend all watch this movie as it would be one must watch thrillers tamil history,0.6056462585034013,0.318265306122449,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.44}"
4.0,"Overrated, lazy and oversmart","4 stars are for the DoP, a few long takes, lead role acting and an interesting 2nd act. Sadly that's all there is to it.The writer(s) employ the laziest techniques throughout the movie and couple of times blatantly lie to the audience to get their attention. For eg. The opening shot shows a masked killed assaulting a couple that gives you an impression that there is a serial killer to be hunted. Later the same shot is shown from the inspector's narration labelled as his theory.Somehow the inspector entirely forgets to follow up on his new recruit after the accident. Even if you give the benefit of doubt, there is no indication or even a mention of how he slipped out of radar after 5 years of comma. Guess the inspector must've forgotten about him entirely since he mentions he has a 'bad memory'So what happened to those three boys who assaulted the traffic police? And one of them confessed to tampering with evidence. Foosh, gone? No action, no follow up, nothing nada.In a flat with nosy neighbours, no one saw guys carrying girl on a gunpoint. Yes there wasn't a security guard but no one saw 2 guys a crying girl and the boy friend injured who followed them later. Okay fine co-incidence. What was Vaishnavi doing till the boyfriend told her what to do? You think a girl who witnessed assault would sit idle after someone carries a girl on gunpoint to assault her again and no call the police or even the neighbors for help?Somehow film students are shooting for their film project for an alternate ending and very conveniently capture the girl entering. Okay I can treat this as suspension of disbelief. Then a girl in the middle of the night let's two guys enter without knowing them, when it's made clear to us that neighbors don't like it. Okay maybe she's dumb. Rajeev does not knock, as if he owns the house, he simply tries to barge in yelling OPEN THE DOOR. Shruti on the other hand is taking a shower at 12 am while it's raining outside. Another reviewer pointed out, that guy's plan was to assault the girl on her birthday. She could have had friends coming or calls to wish her birthday then it hit me, maybe the writer hasn't celebrated a real birthday.At this point I lost all hopes but wait.Final nail in coffin was,when the inspector says something like ... Had she not insulted that guy in front of everyone, would he have assaulted her?Man, I hate whoever wrote this movie. I will fight the fans of his director all my life. What a waste.",overrated lazy oversmart,4 stars are dop few long takes lead role acting interesting 2nd act sadly thats all there is it writer s employ laziest techniques throughout movie couple times blatantly lie audience get their attention eg opening shot shows masked killed assaulting couple that gives you impression that there is serial killer be hunted later same shot is shown inspectors narration labelled as his theory somehow inspector entirely forgets follow up his new recruit after accident even if you give benefit doubt there is no indication or even mention how he slipped out radar after 5 years comma guess inspector mustve forgotten about him entirely since he mentions he has bad memoryso what happened those three boys who assaulted traffic police one them confessed tampering with evidence foosh gone no action no follow up nothing nada flat with nosy neighbours no one saw guys carrying girl gunpoint yes there wasnt security guard but no one saw 2 guys crying girl boy friend injured who followed them later okay fine co incidence what was vaishnavi doing till boyfriend told her what do you think girl who witnessed assault would sit idle after someone carries girl gunpoint assault her again no call police or even neighbors help somehow film students are shooting their film project alternate ending very conveniently capture girl entering okay i can treat this as suspension disbelief then girl middle night lets two guys enter without knowing them when its made clear us that neighbors dont like it okay maybe shes dumb rajeev does not knock as if he owns house he simply tries barge yelling open door shruti other hand is taking shower at 12 am while its raining outside another reviewer pointed out that guys plan was assault girl her birthday she could have had friends coming or calls wish her birthday then it hit me maybe writer hasnt celebrated real birthday at this point i lost all hopes but wait final nail coffin was when inspector says something like had she not insulted that guy front everyone would he have assaulted her man i hate whoever wrote this movie i will fight fans his director all my life what waste,0.385933660933661,-0.023566748566748553,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"

Karthick Naren an young director in his early 20s delivers one of the best thrillers made in Tamil cinema.

In a masala filled industry with cliché dialogues and overrated action sequences,this movie definitely stands out. The movie puts you in the edge of your seat from the very beginning. The movie captures every details so delicately. The plot is decent but the way it is dealt with is what makes the movie so thrilling. Rahman did a great job to keep us thinking till the end.

Masked killer (Makes you want to know who is inside), great introduction2. Rahman rubbing the eyes, which is shown as graphic in introduction. 3. Character of gautham is well made. 4. Up to the climax the killer is given great importance, but the real motive behind the story is ordinary and that intricate details are also well woven in between the plot to minute detail. 5. Ultimately our protagonist falls victim to a fate which he knows far later, but cant much help.I cant believe a debutant director has made this movie.

8.0,Gripping,"Lovely murder mystery. Nice to see a movie with suspense being the theme with perfect pacing, enough eye for details, solidly enacted, no distractions of songs etc. Pretty much whatever makes a good solid yarn of a suspense from the good old school is in here. Two deaths, missing woman, disappearing witness and a Cop led by his assorted bag of assistants, including a new recruit in the hunt.

5.0,Beautiful narration technique cannot hide the plot hole,"The thing good with the movie was the narration technique. It cuts back and forth between what happened 5 years ago and what is happening now in the story. Rahman gave us a nice performance. Almost all the actors were nice. The camera was nice. It used long shots wherever necessary.Now let me come to the problem.The third act is full of plot holes. 1. Why would Krish try to rape Shruti on the day when it is her birthday? There are all chances that at least two or three people would be there to celebrate the birthday. Why couldn't he go on some other day? It was because it was her birthday that Rajeev came and Krish had to lose his life. 2. Why does Krish ask Vaishnavi to lodge a complaint saying that Shruti is missing? Why couldn't he ask her to talk with his father in private about the whole matter? Why does she lie to Deepak that she came to the apartment at dawn?Besides, the scene which is shown like a prologue does not happen at all. That was a very cheap attempt to make us feel like it is a very big twist that we are watching in the third act. All in all, the third act spoils the whole movie.",beautiful narration technique cannot hide plot hole,thing good with movie was narration technique it cuts back forth between what happened 5 years ago what is happening now story rahman gave us nice performance almost all actors were nice camera was nice it used long shots wherever necessary now let me come problem third act is full plot holes 1 why would krish try rape shruti day when it is her birthday there are all chances that at least two or three people would be there celebrate birthday why couldnt he go some other day it was because it was her birthday that rajeev came krish had lose his life 2 why does krish ask vaishnavi lodge complaint saying that shruti is missing why couldnt he ask her talk with his father private about whole matter why does she lie deepak that she came apartment at dawn besides scene which is shown like prologue does not happen at all that was very cheap attempt make us feel like it is very big twist that we are watching third act all all third act spoils whole movie,0.4661904761904762,0.17357142857142863,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
6.0,Overrated but interesting .....,"The 8.8 rating on IMDb is a bit too high for this film. It should be a 6 or 7 at the most. But then we Indians tend to overrate our films on IMDb - just look at the ratings for Baahubali.Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru was absorbing. In fact, it is one of the better Indian movies that I've watched in recent times. The plot might be preposterous. But the director kept it all very interesting with many twists and turns. The film was suspenseful until the every end. Usually I would stop watching Indian thrillers because they would be too over the top and inane. But with Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru, I wanted to know how the mystery would get solved. The big reveal was worth the wait. I had a tough time remembering all the twists and details. The deliberate misdirection or distraction of the viewer with the appearance of the costumed killer in the first scene was a very nice touch.But the casting of Rahman as the main character was surprising. He was too stiff and did not make much of an impact. Neither Rahman nor anyone from the supporting cast made much of an impression on me. But Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru is a decent debut for Karthick Naren.

8.0,A murder mystery with a simple plot in an unpredictable narration,"Written and Directed by debut Karthick Narain. With his 2 short films experience, stepped into feature film by taking a crime thriller as plot. A crime case investigation by a police officer and the way he get into the target along with multiple views from different persons involved is D16.A complete investigative mystery thriller generation where it start the ride from the very beginning without spending much on any ordinary stuffs. Success of a engaging investigation lies on the clue which come across for the next chain of scenes, even a dialogue from the movie says this as few clues of what we intend to know will come to us on its own. When we think of from where to start next, there comes a scene to give the route.Rahman, who do only limited unique character back in for the role where he perfectly fit in and his subtle acting apt for the investigation. Other cast, though they travel throughout, they neatly perform what they expected from them. As there is no songs in this movie, BGM plays the high scope for music director and it truly justified in the movie with right tone. Camera and lighting are well managed as most of the scenes happens at night where the subject shine in dark. Length of the movie is another plus where cuts are rightly placed and the engagement didn't take any downside till end. For a debutant director, the efforts and smartness spent on writing is truly evident while watching this mystery.

9.0,Unlimited twists and turns with well kept suspense.,"Those who were complaining about mainstream films, particularly the non-Indians, the recent time has been in their favour. It was some time since the change has begun, but now the gaps between mainstream and parallel cinema is narrowing. The good news is it's not just Kollywood, but every Indian film industry taking this stride remarkably. Since I'm very attached to Tamil films, my observation says the quality of those film contents were comparable with international standards. Why I'm saying that with confidence is there's a chance this film would be remade elsewhere around the globe.So now you might be curious about this film. It is not a brain teaser. It is simply a mystery, but the developments, especially the film characters never stop till the final. Like the title says, up to 16, the new characters keep coming not giving any space for you to breath. So predicting anything makes so hard. All along the twist and turns, including a couple of them were clichéd which were needed for a screenplay like this, particularly to divert the viewer's attention from foreseeing upcoming scenes. In a similar, I thought I found a big flaw, but after some time moving ahead further I realised I got it all wrong.A middle aged man who recently retired from the police service after an incident that led him to lose one of his legs, recalls a series of events of his final days on the duty with a guest aspiring IPS officer. So going 5 years back when a double murder in the same residential area took place, the investigation kick-starts with bringing-in three suspected youngsters. But later, from different angle of the same incident adds more complication. After joining all the pieces together still they only get different theories, but not truth. That final piece in the puzzle revealed only in the last minute, which deciphered in a style.❝Karma is a boomerang. However far you may hurl it... It will bounce back to us.❞Once you watch finishing it, you will come to know it was a straight story, but turned into a nonlinear narration. Especially the different characters coming into the frame at different stages of the narration are the most cleverest part. It's good to recall everything you saw to make sure you understood the film. Some people watch such film twice and it is surely not a bad idea. But like I said, it is not a briantwister if you focused enough since the beginning. This is one of the shortest Indian films, so the pace was super fast to cover every detail.The entire film was a flashback. That's the main reason to give preference to only the most needed parts. But from the audience perspective, the story they learn can be viewed from any angle for a different result. I mean, some of us usually choose sides if there's a rivalry in the tale. In this film it was a guessing game surrounding the deaths. Except a very few characters, no one stays for very long which only fuels the mystery further.The best part is there's no lie, like any film character committing one to escape the law. The narration only avoids the full detail which is what makes us tough to crack the nut. Those given false statements never see the light on the progression, which is a big hint you if you are watching it for the first time to stay on the right course to possibly come close to the truth before the film reveals itself. It's the writing and the direction that makes this film great. From Hollywood to French, Korean, we often see good script like this, but in the execution where most of them fails. From the casting and performances to the locations, technical side of the film, even turning it into a good quality product with such budget was remarkably done.This is the director's feature film debut and it is a loud statement of his arrival. Mainstream commercial cinema is a trap with big stars, so I hope he stays in the parallel cinema. Coming back to the film, it is a must see for neo-mystery-thriller fans. One of the best films for non-Indians to try if they haven't seen any Indian films. But anyway, I strongly suggest it to everyone.9/10",unlimited twists turns with well kept suspense,those who were complaining about mainstream films particularly non indians recent time has been their favour it was some time since change has begun but now gaps between mainstream parallel cinema is narrowing good news is its not just kollywood but every indian film industry taking this stride remarkably since im very attached tamil films my observation says quality those film contents were comparable with international standards why im saying that with confidence is theres chance this film would be remade elsewhere around globe so now you might be curious about this film it is not brain teaser it is simply mystery but developments especially film characters never stop till final like title says up 16 new characters keep coming not giving any space you breath so predicting anything makes so hard all along twist turns including couple them were clich d which were needed screenplay like this particularly divert viewers attention foreseeing upcoming scenes similar i thought i found big flaw but after some time moving ahead further i realised i got it all wrong middle aged man who recently retired police service after incident that led him lose one his legs recalls series events his final days duty with guest aspiring ips officer so going 5 years back when double murder same residential area took place investigation kick starts with bringing three suspected youngsters but later different angle same incident adds more complication after joining all pieces together still they only get different theories but not truth that final piece puzzle revealed only last minute which deciphered style karma is boomerang however far you may hurl it it will bounce back us once you watch finishing it you will come know it was straight story but turned into nonlinear narration especially different characters coming into frame at different stages narration are most cleverest part its good recall everything you saw make sure you understood film some people watch such film twice it is surely not bad idea but like i said it is not briantwister if you focused enough since beginning this is one shortest indian films so pace was super fast cover every detail entire film was flashback thats main reason give preference only most needed parts but audience perspective story they learn can be viewed any angle different result i mean some us usually choose sides if theres rivalry tale this film it was guessing game surrounding deaths except very few characters no one stays very long which only fuels mystery further best part is theres no lie like any film character committing one escape law narration only avoids full detail which is what makes us tough crack nut those given false statements never see light progression which is big hint you if you are watching it first time stay right course possibly come close truth before film reveals itself its writing direction that makes this film great hollywood french korean we often see good script like this but execution where most them fails casting performances locations technical side film even turning it into good quality product with such budget was remarkably done this is directors feature film debut it is loud statement his arrival mainstream commercial cinema is trap with big stars so i hope he stays parallel cinema coming back film it is must see neo mystery thriller fans one best films non indians try if they havent seen any indian films but anyway i strongly suggest it everyone 9 10,0.4934171547406843,0.11612575333163568,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.35}"

6.0,Too many plot holes and just average direction,"How can a police officer who has taken a shine to a new recruit completely lose track of him after their almost fatal accident? How can a smart recruit who keeps surprising his boss on the first day of his job misunderstand his boss's motives? How can someone who has seen a short glimpse of someone while driving on a poorly lit flyover remember it well enough after 5 years of coma to recognise it the instant they see it? Why does your own son not come and meet you in your office or leave a message at your desk to call him up in a major emergency that involves him killing someone and his girlfriend getting raped? How can someone have the foresight to lie about their own name to someone who they are stalking? And why would you even tell them your name in the first place?And the main police officer seems like a caricature of a smart cop.. looking for validation from a new recruit and having a terribly incompetent team around him. That's now how a good cop functions at all.. anyway.. I did like the pacing of the film, but the ending was especially bad. There was no reason for the death of the main guy (Deepak) and there was really no reason for the recruit (Gautham) to kill him to avenge 5 years of his life lost.. why didn't he kill the murderer instead? And did he really not trust or respect his boss and mentor enough to listen to their reasons for doing something? Uff..

6.0,Forced to be Thrilled..!!,"Dhruvungal Pathinaaru is a commendable attempt at a thriller. But the director has failed to understand a critical rule of film making when it comes to thrillers, is how to misdirect the audience. Misdirection should never be forced on the audience rather it should play within the movie.Addition of an entire scene at the start of the movie in the end to reveal that it was only a figment of one of the characters imagination is literally trying to fool the audience, not misdirect and one of my major concerns with the movie.The other major concern is the use of the word psycho killer as throwing this word around through out the movie creates an expectation toward the spectacular and when the proceedings fall flat instead, effects the entire perception of the movie.Finally, the psycho killer theory is something that is shared only between Deepak and Gautham and this is never made public as the media reports it to be a case of a stalker, killing his victim. Meaning the point at the start of the movie where the visitor asks him about the psycho killer case, it is evident that this is indeed Gautham and the movie could have ended at that point and not dragged on for another hour to the big reveal.Rahman's is the only performance that seems to have mattered to the director so that ends up as the only watchable performance in the movie as the rest are just added to fill the space around Rahman and help the director's attempt to thrill us.In the end D16 is a good attempt at trying to make a thriller but a normal story, forced twists, slow pace make it a hit and miss attempt at a thriller. The high rating is misleading and i believe it is owing to the underdog status given to the movie.",forced be thrilled,dhruvungal pathinaaru is commendable attempt at thriller but director has failed understand critical rule film making when it comes thrillers is how misdirect audience misdirection should never be forced audience rather it should play within movie addition entire scene at start movie end reveal that it was only figment one characters imagination is literally trying fool audience not misdirect one my major concerns with movie other major concern is use word psycho killer as throwing this word around through out movie creates expectation toward spectacular when proceedings fall flat instead effects entire perception movie finally psycho killer theory is something that is shared only between deepak gautham this is never made public as media reports it be case stalker killing his victim meaning point at start movie where visitor asks him about psycho killer case it is evident that this is indeed gautham movie could have ended at that point not dragged another hour big reveal rahmans is only performance that seems have mattered director so that ends up as only watchable performance movie as rest are just added fill space around rahman help directors attempt thrill us end d16 is good attempt at trying make thriller but normal story forced twists slow pace make it hit miss attempt at thriller high rating is misleading i believe it is owing underdog status given movie,0.5271794871794871,0.025384615384615377,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.42}"

7.0,A rise of Murder Mystery Crime Noir in Tamil Cinema comes like a TV Serial.,"Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru (2016) : Brief Review -A rise of Murder Mystery Crime Noir in Tamil Cinema comes like a TV Serial. Don't we all watch TV shows/serials like CID, Crime Petrol, Saavdhaan India etc. where they show us Crime Incidents happened in our country and how police solved the cases? Tamil Film Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru makes a solid 90 mins episode like those serials but just comes in chronological and little suspenseful manners. The film is about a retired police officer who recalls his last case before the accident that caused him to quit his profession. Unlike some other outdated thrillers, this film looks quite original and unpredictable and yes it does have shocking elements in the climax portion but like i said it comes like serial. The execution is sort of low quality and the narration truly doesn't look like a feature film. It has pieces joined to make one episode and so the overall usability of the screenplay doesn't look outstanding. Nevertheless, it is a Great Thriller by all means especially for someone who hasn't seen so many quality thrillers. The acting is fantastic, the writting is reasonable, the screenplay is engaging, the editing is tight, the cinematography looks fine and the Direction is nice too. There is nothing much wrong about the film except the fact that we don't expect such a murder mystery from Tamil industry which is highly obsessed with mainstream filmmaking. However, this attempt is praiseworthy and this might bring lots of changes in filmmaking when next time someone try doing such things and that feature film quality might come soon. So, a fantastic attempt, hopefully this rise of Murder Mystery Crime Noir in Tamil Cinema may provide us some high quality stuff soon.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",rise murder mystery crime noir tamil cinema comes like tv serial,dhuruvangal pathinaaru 2016 brief review rise murder mystery crime noir tamil cinema comes like tv serial dont we all watch tv shows serials like cid crime petrol saavdhaan india etc where they show us crime incidents happened our country how police solved cases tamil film dhuruvangal pathinaaru makes solid 90 mins episode like those serials but just comes chronological little suspenseful manners film is about retired police officer who recalls his last case before accident that caused him quit his profession unlike some other outdated thrillers this film looks quite original unpredictable yes it does have shocking elements climax portion but like i said it comes like serial execution is sort low quality narration truly doesnt look like feature film it has pieces joined make one episode so overall usability screenplay doesnt look outstanding nevertheless it is great thriller by all means especially someone who hasnt seen so many quality thrillers acting is fantastic writting is reasonable screenplay is engaging editing is tight cinematography looks fine direction is nice too there is nothing much wrong about film except fact that we dont expect such murder mystery tamil industry which is highly obsessed with mainstream filmmaking however this attempt is praiseworthy this might bring lots changes filmmaking when next time someone try doing such things that feature film quality might come soon so fantastic attempt hopefully this rise murder mystery crime noir tamil cinema may provide us some high quality stuff soon rating 7 10 by,0.5648079877112134,0.054642857142857146,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.1}"
