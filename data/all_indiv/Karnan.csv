10.0,Comparing with Asuran is just Gross mentality,"You might think these two movies are of same themes. Ultimately as we all know, Asuran was an effort to make a commercial movie set in rural background and for that you really need to pitch the title of whos hero, villain and other roles. While karnan, was ultimately a tale of oppression of a village with dhanush being an influence towards change. Mari Selvaraj has absolutely Executed without a typical template of potraying a hero centric movie or even defining whos the villain here (The evil is the mind, was well shown with Natty playing the role of the police) Those references of Eagles, Donkeys and Dogs were beautifully explained.Ultimately, Karnan has very blended with the mythological themes of mahabharatha, with silouhette shots against the sun and many more.

10.0,Masterpiece,"""Karnan"" is a Tamil language action drama movie which is released in this year. The story is influenced from Kodiyankulam violence. It also takes references of Karna from Mahabharata. Villagers of Tamilnadu become victims of caste oppression. They are deprived from higher education, healthcare, their fundamental and human rights. Their basic demands are ignored by upper caste people and bureaucrats. Finally, the villagers start to protest, they start to raise their voices against the system. Eventually, each and everyone becomes ""Karnan"" or Karna who fights for his rights.Metaphors like headless deity, kite, donkey are used in this film. A masked girl is seen almost in every scene. There's a tradition in rural parts of Tamilnadu, when young girls die before getting married, they're considered equal to Goddess. Though the storyline is simple but the execution is really praiseworthy. BGM is on another level. It'll definitely make you emotional. Cinematography is excellent. The aerial shots are amazing.What to say about Dhanush? I was spellbound after seeing his performance. All the co-actors from Lal to Yogi Babu and even all the supporting actors who play the roles of villagers their performances are very natural. You will actually feel the pain and anger inside every character. I almost cried at the end.Mari Selvaraj, take a bow, man! Thanks for making a masterpiece like ""Karnan"". It's a layered film and it consists of many thought provoking scenes.I highly recommend ""Karnan"" to everyone. You shouldn't miss this film at all.

8.0,"A monumental achievement for Dhanush, Selvaraj and Tamil Cinema to blend a Superior Social Classic with A Grade Mass Appeal.","Karnan (2021) : Brief Review -A monumental achievement for Dhanush, Selvaraj and Tamil Cinema to blend a Superior Social Classic with A Grade Mass Appeal. What Asuran Missed, Karnan has got it alright. That aggresive climax which was missing in Dhanush's Asuran has been found here in Karnan. This is how you make a Cult Film with Massy elements. A chunk of Smart Movie Buffs and Art Lovers always complaint about B grade action in South films and their illogical entertainers, i happened to be one of them too. But there are some films which have that cinematic sense which we look for and stars like Dhanush are one of those countable stars who understand this. With Karnan, Dhanush porves his intelligent choice of scripts again and director Mari Selvaraj gets his second consecutive Classic after Pariyerum Perumal. Comparatively, Karnan is better than Pariyerum Perumal. If you have seen that film then you know how big this compliment is for Karnan. Karnan, a fearless village youth, must fight for the rights of the conservative people of his village, due to the torture given by a police officer. It's a soul-stirring fight against the entire system of those suppressed people who have been overlooked by the upper caste people and government for years. Dhanush acts like he's one of those villager who have endiree this torture for years. The supporting cast is fantastic. Screenplay, Dialogues, Cinematography everything hits the high bar. Even the action scenes have A Grade execution which is rare for South films. Selvaraj has done such a great job that i can't tell in words. I would be laughing on the standard of all prestigious awards if this man doesn't get Best Director Award. Yes he is that GREAT! Karnan deserves your watch like you owed it to them and it's like you'll be doing favour for yourself.

5.0,It's ok movie but lacks sociological and psychological understanding ruining the story,"There is mass element to most Tamil cinema and strong opinionated view towards castesm. They ruined the whole real incident which could have been a genuine story in itself but mixed it up with symbolism muddled it all up and claimed it's good. What it end up feeling is a cooked up story telling out of a real incident.Before adding these issues, there is quote by Gandhi, ""Eye for an eye makes the world blind"".Now should people be silent in in the situation of oppression. No.. But should a past vengeance grudge or social situation be constantly reminded or used as a means to sell movies and keep the visceral idea of ""hatred' bread in the society? Definitely not.You see there is a story arc as well as character arc. In this movie there is only a little bit of any character arc and largely forced character and story arc down to the audience. It doesn't truly makes the villain role any good neither the hero role too. Because of mass nature of the film the hero's character arc gets overshadowed, hidden and villains character development gets so strongly opinionated, muddled and one tone nature and at one time pointless.There is huge lack of psychological, sociological understanding of both character and society which kind of downplays this movie. It's like saying, these people are bad these people are good, and that's it. You aren't given reason like why the hero or villain is so and so and audience intelligence are only feed with already set up idea pushing a thought process sort of blindsided by mass appeal to the movie.For example I gave quote of Gandhi. And Gandhi advocated for nonviolence back in the Brit times, now in today's time should we all say let our soldiers approach nonviolence technique for dealing an attacking enemy? No it's tough. Point being, there is a phase and there are certain nature of human revolution and way of people life style, thinking and so on. It can't be used a means to constantly put people in false perspective or even say one solution for all approach to project an understanding to the viewers.The reason why it heavily missed lack of sociological and psychological understanding is because it comes up with these preconceived notions so strong and it doesn't help to tell a compelling story with the same theme. It loses that opportunity.Though certainly few symbolism are good, but at one point it becomes so obvious and outpouring in each frame just for the feeling of good nature. Be it the small girl wearing the goddess mask or donkey. It's overdone and right in your face which isn't truly good film making. There is no subtle elements to the film or subtext and too easy theme projection because of already views of who, what and how they are.There are so many things which picks up very good and than it's just ends up pointless. Like be it a sport game or love story or childbirth into a conflict. Everything had a great potential, reasoning to help the story to move forward to the final ahaa moment, but it seems so given up midway or false setup.Till half way it had some form of expectation but than it just becomes pointless and boring. Cinematography, BGM, acting for most bits are all good but story didn't had intelligence or true empathetic nature to justify one's transformation. It had a chance to score 7 or even 8, but for fans surely they love each of their favorite hero's acting and performance and it kind of blinds them because fanaticism is as such. It ruins one's mind. But it's upto to people to really get mature now and not take things just for the sake of entertainment but truly as a truth and exploring knowledge too.",its ok movie but lacks sociological psychological understanding ruining story,there is mass element most tamil cinema strong opinionated view towards castesm they ruined whole real incident which could have been genuine story itself but mixed it up with symbolism muddled it all up claimed its good what it end up feeling is cooked up story telling out real incident before adding these issues there is quote by gandhi eye eye makes world blind now should people be silent situation oppression no but should past vengeance grudge or social situation be constantly reminded or used as means sell movies keep visceral idea hatred bread society definitely not you see there is story arc as well as character arc this movie there is only little bit any character arc largely forced character story arc down audience it doesnt truly makes villain role any good neither hero role too because mass nature film heros character arc gets overshadowed hidden villains character development gets so strongly opinionated muddled one tone nature at one time pointless there is huge lack psychological sociological understanding both character society which kind downplays this movie its like saying these people are bad these people are good thats it you arent given reason like why hero or villain is so so audience intelligence are only feed with already set up idea pushing thought process sort blindsided by mass appeal movie example i gave quote gandhi gandhi advocated nonviolence back brit times now todays time should we all say let our soldiers approach nonviolence technique dealing attacking enemy no its tough point being there is phase there are certain nature human revolution way people life style thinking so it cant be used means constantly put people false perspective or even say one solution all approach project understanding viewers reason why it heavily missed lack sociological psychological understanding is because it comes up with these preconceived notions so strong it doesnt help tell compelling story with same theme it loses that opportunity though certainly few symbolism are good but at one point it becomes so obvious outpouring each frame just feeling good nature be it small girl wearing goddess mask or donkey its overdone right your face which isnt truly good film making there is no subtle elements film or subtext too easy theme projection because already views who what how they are there are so many things which picks up very good than its just ends up pointless like be it sport game or love story or childbirth into conflict everything had great potential reasoning help story move forward final ahaa moment but it seems so given up midway or false setup till half way it had some form expectation but than it just becomes pointless boring cinematography bgm acting most bits are all good but story didnt had intelligence or true empathetic nature justify ones transformation it had chance score 7 or even 8 but fans surely they love each their favorite heros acting performance it kind blinds them because fanaticism is as such it ruins ones mind but its upto people really get mature now not take things just sake entertainment but truly as truth exploring knowledge too,0.4950428153717629,0.12800073099415202,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.38}"

8.0,An WONDERFUL Experience. ðŸ”¥,"Karnan is a story of a youth who can't tolerate any injustice. This story has been shown in many films but what differs Karnan from other films is it's superb execution by Mari Selvaraj. From the opening song of the movie you'll start to feel goosebumps. The film is too long because it started slowly in the 1st half but it became a gripping tale in the 2nd half and then you can't move your eyes from the screen.You'll find many Mahabharat references here but fully opposite way. The animals are used for visual storytelling. The music & specially the BGM is superb. Not just Dhanush but the entire cast did a commendable job. Finally, I can't say Karnan a masterpiece but I'm sure you'll have a wonderful experience.Available on Amazon Prime Video.Â© MandalBros.",wonderful experience,karnan is story youth who cant tolerate any injustice this story has been shown many films but what differs karnan other films is its superb execution by mari selvaraj opening song movie youll start feel goosebumps film is too long because it started slowly 1st half but it became gripping tale 2nd half then you cant move your eyes screen youll find many mahabharat references here but fully opposite way animals are used visual storytelling music specially bgm is superb not just dhanush but entire cast did commendable job finally i cant say karnan masterpiece but im sure youll have wonderful experience available amazon prime video mandalbros,0.5496825396825398,0.2974404761904762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.5}"
