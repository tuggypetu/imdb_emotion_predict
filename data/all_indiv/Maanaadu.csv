8,A Tamil movie unlike any other in the recent past!,"I went into this movie with 0 expectations, and it was SO MUCH better than I thought it would be.People have tried different things in Kollywood in past with little success, while this different attempt deserves credit, if the movie is bad, it's just bad. But Tamil audience gets up in arms about the bad reviews and says ""You'd watch the exact same concept in a Hollywood movie, but you trash it in Kollywood? You're anti-national!"" LMAOwut?THIS is how those movies should have panned out. Glad that the general Tamil audience has something to compare the deservedly trash movies to. Shoutout to Venkat Prabhu for trying something different and actually pulling it off really well.I can't believe I'm saying this but Simbu, SJ Surya did a great job, however, the writing and editing steal the show. This bold script could have ended up being trash, but faaar from it. You, of course, have to suspend some disbelief (which you need to do for Hollywood movies as well) and this movie will keep you engaged, from start to finish. No mirch masala, no drama. No duets and unnecessary songs and dances; overall a no-nonsense movie, the likes of which you've not watched in Tamil cinema for a while.Watch this in the theaters to really be immersed, especially for Yuvan Shankar Raja's music.",tamil movie unlike any other recent past,i went into this movie with 0 expectations it was so much better than i thought it would be people have tried different things kollywood past with little success while this different attempt deserves credit if movie is bad its just bad but tamil audience gets up arms about bad reviews says youd watch exact same concept hollywood movie but you trash it kollywood youre anti national lmaowut this is how those movies should have panned out glad that general tamil audience has something compare deservedly trash movies shoutout venkat prabhu trying something different actually pulling it off really well i cant believe im saying this but simbu sj surya did great job however writing editing steal show this bold script could have ended up being trash but faaar it you course have suspend some disbelief which you need do hollywood movies as well this movie will keep you engaged start finish no mirch masala no drama no duets unnecessary songs dances overall no nonsense movie likes which youve not watched tamil cinema while watch this theaters really be immersed especially yuvan shankar rajas music,0.4646666666666666,-0.0071666666666666415,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7,ENTERTAINING BRAIN TEASER: VP Repeats MANKATHA Magic For STR,"Maanaadu is a feast of sound, vision, even taste. It is noteworthy that Venkat Prabhu tells a complex sci-fi story, but it is completely plausible with a good first half of being confronted with a film whose plot one can predict after a while, only to be confronted a little later with twists and turns that were simply KICKASS. You could say that halfway through as it makes you anticipate for an interval bang and the film does a U-turn which pays off.Venkat Prabhu shows the power dynamics and how corrupt people incite violence in the name of religion and the depths of the human mind where terrifying creatures can hide. But what makes the film so interesting: The irony with which the he proceeded here with his writing for SJ Suryah (Dhanuskodi) whose over the top antics is fun to watch supported by Simbu's (Abdul Khaaliq) excellent performance and it is commendable to see him experiment shedding his mass hero image. The conflict fits in harmoniously and with disastrous consequences in the event and challenging their own fate. They both hold the plot together and it is the beginning and the end and it repeats (maybe Part 2).The editing deserves a special mention here, so expect a break neck pace and whiplash sequences which keeps the 2nd half in a tense zone, It is supported with terrific soundtrack by Yuvan Shankar Raja (whoever saw the film will understand that).Conclusion: It has a unique vision, and VP stages scenes in an interesting way to express the tug-of-war and i'm sure it will cater to all types of audiences. This film contains all the things that an audience would expect to make it a pure entertaining and HOOT worthy watch.",entertaining brain teaser vp repeats mankatha magic str,maanaadu is feast sound vision even taste it is noteworthy that venkat prabhu tells complex sci fi story but it is completely plausible with good first half being confronted with film whose plot one can predict after while only be confronted little later with twists turns that were simply kickass you could say that halfway through as it makes you anticipate interval bang film does u turn which pays off venkat prabhu shows power dynamics how corrupt people incite violence name religion depths human mind where terrifying creatures can hide but what makes film so interesting irony with which he proceeded here with his writing sj suryah dhanuskodi whose over top antics is fun watch supported by simbus abdul khaaliq excellent performance it is commendable see him experiment shedding his mass hero image conflict fits harmoniously with disastrous consequences event challenging their own fate they both hold plot together it is beginning end it repeats maybe part 2 editing deserves special mention here so expect break neck pace whiplash sequences which keeps 2nd half tense zone it is supported with terrific soundtrack by yuvan shankar raja whoever saw film will understand that conclusion it has unique vision vp stages scenes interesting way express tug war im sure it will cater all types audiences this film contains all things that audience would expect make it pure entertaining hoot worthy watch,0.6025493025493025,0.1719877344877345,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.16}"

7,A cracking comeback for both STR and Venkat Prabhu.,"Both STR's and Venkat Prabhu's careers really needed a home run for them to stay relevant and 'Maanadu' is exactly that. The film takes on Time Loop as it's central conceit and weaves a taut screenplay that seldom drags. Once we're past the generic first 15 minutes the film just takes off into a nail-biting thriller. It keeps on building and most of the twists work really well. It's not necessarily a new concept to Hollywood (Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow) but is definitely a novelty for Tamil mainstream. The story needs a dangerous but wildly entertaining villain for it to work and who better to do it than SJ Suryah. His enjoyably exaggerated performances over time have made me think that he might be the Jim Carrey of Tamil cinema. There are some 'laugh out loud' moments involving him and YG Mahendran, who was solid. Yuvan gives a typically driving score that keeps up with the film's pace. All in all VP has successfully blended high concept into a tight masala screenplay to deliver one hell of an entertainer.",cracking comeback both str venkat prabhu,both strs venkat prabhus careers really needed home run them stay relevant maanadu is exactly that film takes time loop as its central conceit weaves taut screenplay that seldom drags once were past generic first 15 minutes film just takes off into nail biting thriller it keeps building most twists work really well its not necessarily new concept hollywood groundhog day edge tomorrow but is definitely novelty tamil mainstream story needs dangerous but wildly entertaining villain it work who better do it than sj suryah his enjoyably exaggerated performances over time have made me think that he might be jim carrey tamil cinema there are some laugh out loud moments involving him yg mahendran who was solid yuvan gives typically driving score that keeps up with films pace all all vp has successfully blended high concept into tight masala screenplay deliver one hell entertainer,0.4642542306178669,0.10666273120818577,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.38}"
