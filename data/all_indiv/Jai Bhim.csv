10,"Suriya's Jai Bhim Deserves To Get An Oscar Award For The Best Movie, And Suriya Deserves To Get The Best Actor Award !!!","In a scene in Jai Bhim, a group of tribals man meet a police office who is heading an inquiry commission about the disappearance of three missing tribals who were being interrogated by the police about a theft case. One man tells him that he was once arrested by cops just for greeting them. Another tells him about how he was arrested just because he tried to slink away fearing them. A woman narrates how her husband was forced to 'confess' to a crime which he had not committed after the cops started molesting her. A young boy mentions that the police picked him up just because they could not get his father, and how that one incident made him a perennial suspect at school. These people are clearly damned if they did, and damned if they didn't.This scene is an echo of the scene that opens the film. We see many prisoners being let out of prison. A few cops from the surrounding police stations are waiting. As each prisoner comes out, he is asked for his caste. If they mention a dominant caste's name, they are asked to leave. But those who belong to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, they are told to stand in a corner, only for the waiting cops to pick them up as suspects in the many cases that remain unsolved in their station. When some of them complain that there are too few for them to foist cases on, they are told that they could accuses a few of committing more than one crime.With scenes like these, Jai Bhim powerfully captures the abuse and humiliation that is heaped upon the underprivileged by those in power and the kind of defiance it will take to get them justice. Like Visaaranai and the recent Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, the film is also a fierce criticism of police brutality. The plot revolves around Rajakannu (Manikandan) and Sengani (Lijomol Jose), a couple who live at Konamalai near Viluppuram. They belong to the Irular tribe, and despite their poverty - they still cannot afford a brick house - they are contented and happy. Especially with their daughter Alli going to school and a second child on its way.But their happiness is dashed when cops come in search of Rajakannu over a robbery. The poor man has become the main suspect just because he happened to be the one who had visited the house where the robbery happened that day to catch a snake. Unable to find him, the police pick up the pregnant Sengani and a few other men from the tribe, including Rajakannu's brother Irutappan. Sengani is later let go - not before being beaten and kicked multiple times - but for Rajakannu and a couple of others, there is no respite from the harrowing violence unleashed upon by the men in khakhi. When Sengani hears that the three men have escaped and their whereabouts unknown, she reached out to Chandru (Suriya), a righteous lawyer who fights for the downtrodden. But can they uncover the truth with an entire system standing against them?Jai Bhim is an unexpected sophomore effort from TJ Gnanavel, who had previously directed the uneven drama Kootathil Oruvan. This is a film that is raw, real and brutal, with gritty filmmaking enhancing the solid writing. It effectively portrays the wrongs that are done to the underprivileged without seeming exploitative or overly melodramatic. Despite being one of the oldest communities in the country, these tribes do not even have any proof to show that they are its citizens and cannot even own a piece of the land. When Mythra (Rajisha Vijayan), a teacher who is part of an adult literacy programme, tries to get them a voter id, the local big shot, who belongs to a dominant caste, retorts, ""Isn't it enough we have to request the lower castes to vote for us? Should we also go to the homes of these fellows?""Gnanavel gives us some terrific moments of defiance. Lijomol Jose is quietly powerful as Sengani, who gets a couple of rousing scenes when she turns down efforts at a compromise from cops. Manikandan, too, is effective and stands out in the scene when he urges his men to not give in as that will result in their community being branded as criminals. The director also portrays the intimacy between Sengani and Rajakannu in a charming manner.The film is based on a real-life incident involving Justice K Chandru, from his days as a lawyer. Suriya plays this role with the right amount of intensity and earnestness, which helps the character seem grounded even while the film and Sean Roldan's score try to build him up as a can-do-no-wrong superhero. In fact, his introduction scene wouldn't be out of place in a masala movie. But after Soorarai Pottru, this is another notable film for the star as a performer.And his scenes with Prakash Raj, who plays the inquiry commission head, Perumalsamy, give us calm and composed dialogue that act as a counterpoint to the flinching violence and the moving melodrama. The latter lends the role with a great deal of dignity to a character who believes one has to take up a little bit of authoritarianism to protect democracy. So, we have a lawyer who considers the police as the worst and a cop who finds lawyers the worst working together to ensure justice is done. Through these scenes, Gnanavel - as one of the judges in the film mentions - shows how justice can be upheld when law and order work hand in hand.There are only a couple of missteps. After a point, the violence begins to feel like torture porn, even though the film presents these episodes as flashbacks of events that happened over a day or two. And in a narrative sense, Chandru's efforts to unravel the mystery and his battle in court feels somewhat easier because there are no strong antagonists. Both Rao Ramesh as the advocate general and Guru Somasundaram as the public prosecutor never come across as formidable foes for Chandru in court. That said, as Chandru unravels one cover-up after another, the film makes us realise the extent to which unchecked power can go to maintain status quo.But these doesn't lessen the emotional impact of the film, which, along with films like Visaaranai, Kirumi and Kavalthurai Ungal Nanban, is a much-needed antidote to restore the balance in portrayals of the police in an industry overrun by the Singams and the Saamys.",suriyas jai bhim deserves get oscar award best movie suriya deserves get best actor award,scene jai bhim group tribals man meet police office who is heading inquiry commission

8,"""It will be quite an uphill battle.""","There's some serious upvoting for this film here on IMDb; if not for a weighted averaging of the film's rating by viewers, this would be the number one movie of all time having just come out this year, and that by a wide margin. I thought the movie was good for it's portrayal of corrupt authorities taken down by a dedicated attorney, it hit on many of the points that social justice advocates clamor for here in this country. Based on a true story, one can only marvel at the dedication of a man like Chandru (Suriya), who utilized every bit of means and cunning to humiliate the brutal police authorities and their corrupt political allies. Many times it's a difficult story to watch, as the beatings and punishment doled out by district police against members of lower castes approach grotesquely inhumane treatment. Chandru's efforts eventually pay off, and it was inspiring to see him honored by the citizens he represented at the finale, reminiscent of that final scene of Gregory Peck in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".One note of caution when coming to the IMDb title page - the names of characters listed in the credits don't match the corresponding identification of characters in the film. As an example, actress Lijo Mol Jose portrayed the agonized wife Sengoni in the credits, but in the film, captioning described her as 'Sannamma'. I'm not versed well enough in Indian nomenclature to know if that's a result of translation or some other factor. I would also question the narrative offered at the end of the story that stated the attorney portrayed in the picture was responsible for ninety six thousand cases in six years. To do that, he would have to have been involved with over forty cases per day, every single day for six years, with no days off!",it will be quite uphill battle,theres some serious upvoting this film here imdb if not weighted averaging films rating by viewers this would be number one movie all time having just come out this year that by wide margin i thought movie was good its portrayal corrupt authorities taken down by dedicated attorney it hit many points that social justice advocates clamor here this country based true story one can only marvel at dedication man like chandru suriya who utilized every bit means cunning humiliate brutal police authorities their corrupt political allies many times its difficult story watch as beatings punishment doled out by district police against members lower castes approach grotesquely inhumane treatment chandrus efforts eventually pay off it was inspiring see him honored by citizens he represented at finale reminiscent that final scene gregory peck kill mockingbird one note caution when coming imdb title page names characters listed credits dont match corresponding identification characters film as example actress lijo mol jose portrayed agonized wife sengoni credits but film captioning described her as sannamma im not versed well enough indian nomenclature know if thats result translation or some other factor i would also question narrative offered at end story that stated attorney portrayed picture was responsible ninety six thousand cases six years do that he would have have been involved with over forty cases per day every single day six years with no days off,0.6309351276742581,-0.055521048999309874,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.52}"

8,"Brilliant, hard-hitting & a must watch.","Turns out, the movie is based on a real-life incident from 1993.In times when being a policeman is mostly glorified in Indian cinema, I wasn't expecting a movie about police brutality, something that's usually swept under the rugs, which makes this an important film in Tamil film industry and thanks to streaming services, in Indian Cinema.The storytelling does a great job of making you care enough for Rajakannu and Sengani (both brilliantly played, with Lijomol being the show stealer in this movie) that you empathize with them throughout the movie. Parts of the movie were brutal and hard to watch, don't be surprised if you find yourself shouting ""Okay that's enough! STOP!"" at the events that unfold. Suriya and Prakash Raj play their respective roles with just enough intensity, nothing over the top with this one. Acting by all of the support cast was very well done.As much as this film is about police brutality, this is also about casteism, which is still prevalent in our great country. Movies, both good and bad ones, in the past on this topic have been made, but you can tell if the script is trying too hard to highlight the caste system. This one, I thought, did it just right and didn't overdo it.If you HAVE to, you can find things wrong with the movie - some cinematic liberty, the ""comedic"" elements, some ""mass moments"", were all necessary IMO. That said, this isn't the kind of movie you find flaws in, but the kind that you watch, and learn and grown from as a person.

8,"Do Yourself A Favor, Leave Everything And Watch Suriya's Hard-Hitting Drama","Jai Bhim turned out to be a hard-hitting, raw and powerful court-room drama. The purpose of cinema is not just to entertain but also educate and empower the audience. The courtroom drama based movies are always engaging as the prosecutor and defendant both fight to solve the case with solid evidences and innumerable witnesses.Bollywood Films like ""Damini"", ""Jolly LLB"",""Talvar"" ""Rustom"", ""Pink"" or even ""Section 375"" have been immensely successful in keeping the audience engaged with impeccable dialogues and fantastic screenplay but what makes Jai Bhim different is the beautiful message on morality and equality of a tribal woman who fights for the justice of her husband.Jai Bhim is based on 1995 Habeas Corpus petition in which human right activist cum lawyer K. Chandru ( played by Suriya ), who takes up the case of Irular tribe couple (Rajakannu and Sengeni) where the husband is wrongly convicted by local police for stealing ornaments from village head's house.As Jai Bhim opens, we see that cops segregating the prisoners based on their caste. Among all the caste, the tribal people becomes the easy target for the cops to clear the pending cases under the influence of their political head. We also see how Rajakannu, the main accused in the jewelry case, is forcibly taken away from his family. The film goes back in the flashback mode where life of the tribal couple is beautiful in the serene village where they hone the skills of catching rat for their bosses. As their life progresses, in one of the event Rajakannu and his brothers are caught for the crime which they did not commit. They go through extreme level of police harassment and torture which will be very hard to digest and is completely raw. Enter Chandra a.k.a Suriya who takes up the case when Sengeni narrates the entire incident and request to help find her husband who as per police, has been absconding from the jail.Jai Bhim is one such hair-raising film which is definitely difficult to digest as it gives you goosebumps and eye-popping experience.
