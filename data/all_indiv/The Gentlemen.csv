9.0,Ritchie returns to the crime genre and does so masterfully,"Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.The style this movie possesses is just so much fun to watch. If you've seen any of Ritchie's previous similar films ('Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Snatch', 'RocknRolla') then you know what I'm talking about. The pacing moves at lightning speed, the dialogue is quick, clever and deeper than you first realise and the conflict is always multi-layered. This one is actually told in quite a unique way with a couple of characters going over events that have already happened and it works masterfully. It breaks the story up and gives room for creativity in the story-telling process and also humour.Every time I see that Ritchie has made a movie that isn't a crime-thriller I get a little disappointed. It's not that the other stuff he's doing is bad ('Swept Away' being an obvious exception), it's just that he is so damn good as this style of movie. He's the best in the business and if he only did these for the rest of his career I'd be a very happy man. This is an excellent movie well worth your time and money.",ritchie returns crime genre does so masterfully,has there ever been bad performance guy ritchie movie if there has i havent noticed it he has ornate ability take average actors make them great take already great actors get even more out them there are few directors around who specialise this but ritchie is right near top cast gentlemen is admittedly fantastic but it doesnt change fact that they are absolute treat watch matthew mcconaughey is his element role that he was born play charlie hunnam plays one coolest characters ive seen perfectly colin farrell is hilarious ridiculously cool as well then hugh grant gives one best performances ive ever seen him fact grant was so good i didnt even recognise his voice had wonder if theyd dubbed it they hadnt hed just nailed it style this movie possesses is just so much fun watch if youve seen any ritchies previous similar films lock stock two smoking barrels snatch rocknrolla then you know what im talking about pacing moves at lightning speed dialogue is quick clever deeper than you first realise conflict is always multi layered this one is actually told quite unique way with couple characters going over events that have already happened it works masterfully it breaks story up gives room creativity story telling process also humour every time i see that ritchie has made movie that isnt crime thriller i get little disappointed its not that other stuff hes doing is bad swept away being obvious exception its just that he is so damn good as this style movie hes best business if he only did these rest his career id be very happy man this is excellent movie well worth your time money,0.6020913770913773,0.3130148005148005,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"

9.0,That's Hugh Grant?! It seems so unlike him in his other films!,"Aside from a few very marketable films like ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" and ""Aladdin"", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch""....and so it's not surprising I'd see ""The Gentlemen"". And, like these other films, it's near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.So this leads me to a huge warning. This is NOT a family-friendly film nor one you want to show your mother or Father Jenkins if he stops by for a visit. There's ample cursing, loads of violence, vomit galore, and the story is about bad people...very bad people.The story is complicated...and goes together like a finely crafted puzzle. It concerns a marijuana czar in Britain, Michael Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) and his desire to sell out and retire to a life of ease and sophistication. However, after making an offer to a rival drug kingpin, suddenly everything goes haywire....folks start dying, farms growing the stuff are hit and an all-out war seems inevitable. There's WAY more to the story than this...but since it's so complex, it's best you just see it to appreciate it.The bottom line is that Guy Ritchie can write and direct amazing films...and this one is truly amazing and entertaining. Apart from his misguided vanity project, ""Swept Away"", his output has been impressive and I cannot stress enough what a quality product this film is. My only MINOR quibble is what about the Russian mobster.....what happens with him? This isn't really dealt with in the film and seems a bit like a dangling plot point.",thats hugh grant it seems so unlike him his other films,aside few very marketable films like sherlock holmes game shadows aladdin guy ritchie is writer director who makes incredibly violent films that is incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed near perfect while i rarely ever watch violent films i eagerly look his next dark british crime film after seeing his lock stock two smoking barrels snatch so its not surprising id see gentlemen like these other films its near perfect film you ought see if you have stomach this sort story so this leads me huge warning this is not family friendly film nor one you want show your mother or father jenkins if he stops by visit theres ample cursing loads violence vomit galore story is about bad people very bad people story is complicated goes together like finely crafted puzzle it concerns marijuana czar britain michael pearson matthew mcconaughey his desire sell out retire life ease sophistication however after making offer rival drug kingpin suddenly everything goes haywire folks start dying farms growing stuff are hit all out war seems inevitable theres way more story than this but since its so complex its best you just see it appreciate it bottom line is that guy ritchie can write direct amazing films this one is truly amazing entertaining apart his misguided vanity project swept away his output has been impressive i cannot stress enough what quality product this film is my only minor quibble is what about russian mobster what happens with him this isnt really dealt with film seems bit like dangling plot point,0.5918803418803418,0.07901709401709404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.37}"

9.0,Guy Ritchie,"Yes, I am tempted to say he's back. It's not that he went away or didn't have at least some decent movies over the last few years. I haven't seen Aladdin, but it was succesful sort of. But this is right up his alley! This is pure and enjoyable Guy Ritchie, with timeline cuts and jumps and characters that one may think only he can write.It's so great to see Matthew McConaughey joining the ranks, being a substitue for Jason Statham I reckon. But also having Hugh Grant in this ... role/character. Genius! Who'd have thunk it, and he kills it (no pun intended). At least a few twists will be easy to spot, but I don't think one can guess everything. Even so, the movie is so well made, it won't really matter. If you like the genre, this is the one to watch.

9.0,A ruthless first-class kick in the teeth!,"The rather unconventional visionary Guy Ritchie has been stuck in a Hollywood rut for the last ten years, ever since he committed to big budget, visual effects heavy films, such as Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and this year's underwhelming live action version of the classic Disney, 'Aladdin'. The British director goes back to his roots with the highly entertaining gangster film 'The Gentlemen' and surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes.Although his 'Aladdin' made a ton of money, critically the film was a disaster. His return to the underground world of bribery, drugs, money-laundering and blood-covered-class, is as refreshing as it is entertaining. The film's script deals with two storylines at the same time, almost breaking the fourth wall with a tongue-in-cheek commentary on today's Hollywood and how big movie studios are hungry for some original yet overly mainstream basic content, to lure people into cinemas to go watch their films.Beginning with a quick flash forward that ends with a bang and a pair of brains splattered all over a pint and a pickled egg at a typical British pub, we dial it back to a quiet evening at Raymond's (Charlie Hunnam) cosy house. When private investigator and intrusive sly fox, Fletcher (Hugh Grant), turns up at his house, he explains he has been keeping an eye on the different gangs around town for quite a while. Narrating most of the film and making some stuff up to make things more spectacular for himself, he reads his mostly finished movie script to Raymond, bribing him into funding his little project, or else he'll leak all the information he has on Raymond's boss Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a white trash American expat who has build himself a marijuana empire.Mickey is tired of the business and is trying to sell his highly profitable company to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. But when one of the underground weed-plantations gets raided by a group of British lads, filming the entire thing and posting it on YouTube as some sort of fight--music-video, it quickly becomes clear some mobster bosses haven't been exactly honest about their meetings and loyalty towards each other. This is when the real war begins - while keeping it classy.Ritchie co-wrote the story with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies, who haven't written anything before. The idea of the entire film is prodigious, but the screenplay and dialogue is simply unprecedented by Ritchie himself, bringing joke after joke, while taking you on a thrilling ride full of genius twists and new ways to incorporate classic gangster cinema - Ritchie-style. Composer Christopher Benstead is debuting his very first score for a feature film with The Gentlemen, and knows exactly how to set the tone and drive it up to an eleven. A promising talent that won't go unnoticed.Ritchie introduces new characters throughout the film, keeping the audience on the edge of their seat, surprising them with actual cinema, getting the best angles and money shots, thanks to his cinematographer Alan Stewart (Aladdin). When adding layer after layer to the story, going deeper into the underground scene, adding a new protagonist who's into human trafficking and Mickey's queen and wife, the cockney Cleopatra, Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), who owns a sanctuary for the ladies as some sort of business coverup to her husband's weed-empire, it becomes clear every role has a purpose and there are no extras involved in this story. One of the best acting ensembles in recent cinema history, and a welcome reminder from McConnaughey as to why he won an Oscar in the first place. But it's Colin Farrell (as the highly entertaining 'Coach') and Hugh Grant who steal every scene they're in with their remarkable wit that'll for sure land them some BAFTA-nominations.'The Gentlemen' is a ruthless first-class kick in the teeth. Do not let the failures of Ritchie's recent career choices scare you, as this is actually one of the best films he's ever made. Who knew Guy Ritchie could raise the bar not just for himself, but for everyone out there trying to brush him off as a has been. 2020 is off to a great start!",ruthless first class kick teeth,rather unconventional visionary guy ritchie has been stuck hollywood rut last ten years ever since he committed big budget visual effects heavy films such as sherlock holmes king arthur legend sword this years underwhelming live action version classic disney aladdin british director goes back his roots with highly entertaining gangster film gentlemen surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes although his aladdin made ton money critically film was disaster his return underground world bribery drugs money laundering blood covered class is as refreshing as it is entertaining films script deals with two storylines at same time almost breaking fourth wall with tongue cheek commentary todays hollywood how big movie studios are hungry some original yet overly mainstream basic content lure people into cinemas go watch their films beginning with quick flash forward that ends with bang pair brains splattered all over pint pickled egg at typical british pub we dial it back quiet evening at raymonds charlie hunnam cosy house when private investigator intrusive sly fox fletcher hugh grant turns up at his house he explains he has been keeping eye different gangs around town quite while narrating most film making some stuff up make things more spectacular himself he reads his mostly finished movie script raymond bribing him into funding his little project or else hell leak all information he has raymonds boss mickey pearson matthew mcconaughey white trash american expat who has build himself marijuana empire mickey is tired business is trying sell his highly profitable company dynasty oklahoma billionaires but when one underground weed plantations gets raided by group british lads filming entire thing posting it youtube as some sort fight music video it quickly becomes clear some mobster bosses havent been exactly honest about their meetings loyalty towards each other this is when real war begins while keeping it classy ritchie co wrote story with ivan atkinson marn davies who havent written anything before idea entire film is prodigious but screenplay dialogue is simply unprecedented by ritchie himself bringing joke after joke while taking you thrilling ride full genius twists new ways incorporate classic gangster cinema ritchie style composer christopher benstead is debuting his very first score feature film with gentlemen knows exactly how set tone drive it up eleven promising talent that wont go unnoticed ritchie introduces new characters throughout film keeping audience edge their seat surprising them with actual cinema getting best angles money shots thanks his cinematographer alan stewart aladdin when adding layer after layer story going deeper into underground scene adding new protagonist whos into human trafficking mickeys queen wife cockney cleopatra rosalind michelle dockery who owns sanctuary ladies as some sort business coverup her husbands weed empire it becomes clear every role has purpose there are no extras involved this story one best acting ensembles recent cinema history welcome reminder mcconnaughey as why he won oscar first place but its colin farrell as highly entertaining coach hugh grant who steal every scene theyre with their remarkable wit thatll sure land them some bafta nominations gentlemen is ruthless first class kick teeth do not let failures ritchies recent career choices scare you as this is actually one best films hes ever made who knew guy ritchie could raise bar not just himself but everyone out there trying brush him off as has been 2020 is off great start,0.4249065656565656,0.18262026515151514,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,"""I'm basing my crescendo on the sum of it's parts.""","Any Guy Ritchie film I've seen, he always delivers, especially when he's writer and director. This one follows in the tradition of ""Rocknrolla"", ""Snatch"", and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", the story layered with multiple sets of gangsters trying to outdo each other for the grand prize at the end of the flick. I got a kick out of the opening scene in which the bartender pouring Michael Pearson's (Matthew McConaughey) pint pulls down on the bar tap handle reading 'Ritchie Sewing Company', a self promoting piece of business I found pretty clever.This one doesn't seem to be as hard to follow as the earlier mentioned films. All of them prompted a second viewing to catch all the nuance of the characters, but this one, even with the chronology going back and forth, was pretty straightforward. That's probably due to the format, essentially a narration of events by journalist Fletcher (Hugh Grant) relating his investigative work to Pearson's right hand man, bodyguard and driver Raymond (Charlie Hunnam). Colin Farrell's character is simply known as 'Coach', and he's drawn into the story by virtue of his gangsta underlings botching a take down of one of Pearson's weed farms. What could have been an ancillary character winds up being central to the outcome of the story.And just about when you think it's over, another twist occurs with the introduction of a Russian oligarch and his mission of revenge for the death of his son. All the while you have to wonder how the picture's principal character, that would be Pearson, manages to come out of the story intact, considering all the bad guys who want to do him in. It's a fun watch if you go for this kind of stuff, made all the merrier by the script's creative use of the English language.

With The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie goes one step further in proving himself a national treasure of our friends the Brits.With the help of a cast comprised of big names and lovable favorites such as Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Hugh Grant and the inimitable Colin Farrell, as well as an intelligent, engaging and entertaining script, Guy Ritchie once again comes through in delivering sumptuous fare for the eyes and ears and heart. Here, Mickey Pearson (McConaughey), is a powerful American marijuana dealer based in England whose plan it is to retire and sell off his marijuana empire for a cool £400 Million to spend more time with his wife. As can be expected, more than a wrench is thrown into his plan. What ensues, is giddy entertainment a'la Chef Ritchie's Specialty of witty, super-fast, intelligent, humorous exchanges and more than a few sleights-of-hand by a gallery of engaging and colorful characters who are thrown into numerous subplots, countless twists and turns, betrayals, confrontations and several inevitable revelations.Sounds confusing 'duneh it'? It isn't.Sit back and enjoy the rich mischievousness with which this is all served and rest assured that Ritchie is a master. With a deft and artful hand and sure command of his narrative threads, he has fun rearranging the linearity of the story (which if attempted by anyone else might be confusing), and delivers something close to a masterpiece.8.7/10",film watch tracksuits wear 2020 look no further than gentlemen,love actually hugh grant who coincidentally also lends his acting talents gentlemen tells group reporters we may be small country but were great one too country shakespeare churchill beatles sean connery harry potter david beckhams right foot david beckhams left foot come think it well my opinion he forgot mention guy ritchie who is known his gangster films lock stock two smoking barrels 1998 snatch 2000 among others as well as sherlock holmes films 2009 2011 with gentlemen guy ritchie goes one step further proving himself national treasure our friends brits with help cast comprised big names lovable favorites such as matthew mcconaughey charlie hunnam hugh grant inimitable colin farrell as well as intelligent engaging entertaining script guy ritchie once again comes through delivering sumptuous fare eyes ears heart here mickey pearson mcconaughey is powerful american marijuana dealer based england whose plan it is retire sell off his marijuana empire cool 400 million spend more time with his wife as can be expected more than wrench is thrown into his plan what ensues is giddy entertainment ala chef ritchies specialty witty super fast intelligent humorous exchanges more than few sleights hand by gallery engaging colorful characters who are thrown into numerous subplots countless twists turns betrayals confrontations several inevitable revelations sounds confusing duneh it it isnt sit back enjoy rich mischievousness with which this is all served rest assured that ritchie is master with deft artful hand sure command his narrative threads he has fun rearranging linearity story which if attempted by anyone else might be confusing delivers something close masterpiece 8 7 10,0.5176492819349962,0.23795351473922902,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.33}"

8.0,Must hold the record for the most frequent use of the 'C' word.,"Having spent a decade or so making Hollywood blockbusters (with varying degrees of success), director Guy Ritchie returns to the genre that first made him famous: Tarantino à la UK. Some might see this as a backwards step, but in my opinion, it's what he does best.This time around, the ace in Ritchie's hand is Hugh Grant, who brilliantly plays pivotal character Fletcher, a tabloid reporter who tries to blackmail powerful drug lord Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), threatening to publish an extremely damaging story if he doesn't receive a payment of £20m within 72 hours. The film unfolds as Fletcher tells Pearson's right hand man Ray (Charlie Hunnam) the story of how he gathered the dirt on his boss. Grant's performance is pure genius: playing against type he is seriously sleazy and frequently hilarious.Not that the rest of the cast are any slouches: Hunnam is cool and badass, Colin Farrell displays a keen comedic touch as tough gym owner Coach, McConaughey is his usual affable self (but with a seriously dangerous edge), Michelle Dockery impresses as Pearson's spunky wife Rosalind, and Jeremy Strong holds his own as the criminal who wants to buy Pearson's marijuana operation. Even the minor characters are great as well, from the Coach's grime-loving lads 'TheToddlers' to the obnoxious housing estate yoofs who give Ray's 'muscle' the runaround.Ritchie's writing and direction is possibly his best yet, the script sparkling with wit and the visuals both stylish and confident. The dialogue is extremely funny (and loaded with expletives), the violence gloriously OTT, and the characters memorable. It might be a case of Ritchie 'playing it safe' by revisiting familiar territory, but when the result is as entertaining as this, why the hell not?",must hold record most frequent use c word,having spent decade or so making hollywood blockbusters with varying degrees success director guy ritchie returns genre that first made him famous tarantino la uk some might see this as backwards step but my opinion its what he does best this time around ace ritchies hand is hugh grant who brilliantly plays pivotal character fletcher tabloid reporter who tries blackmail powerful drug lord mickey pearson matthew mcconaughey threatening publish extremely damaging story if he doesnt receive payment 20m within 72 hours film unfolds as fletcher tells pearsons right hand man ray charlie hunnam story how he gathered dirt his boss grants performance is pure genius playing against type he is seriously sleazy frequently hilarious not that rest cast are any slouches hunnam is cool badass colin farrell displays keen comedic touch as tough gym owner coach mcconaughey is his usual affable self but with seriously dangerous edge michelle dockery impresses as pearsons spunky wife rosalind jeremy strong holds his own as criminal who wants buy pearsons marijuana operation even minor characters are great as well coachs grime loving lads thetoddlers obnoxious housing estate yoofs who give rays muscle runaround ritchies writing direction is possibly his best yet script sparkling with wit visuals both stylish confident dialogue is extremely funny loaded with expletives violence gloriously ott characters memorable it might be case ritchie playing it safe by revisiting familiar territory but when result is as entertaining as this why hell not,0.6536679536679536,0.29489489489489484,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.36}"

5.0,"A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies.","I've enjoyed a good portion of Guy Ritchie's filmmaking. While many of his more recent movies rely on franchise appeal (Sherlock Holmes (2009), The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and Aladdin (2019) are of note), I usually associate his style of filmmaking with the British heist film (like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000)). Consequently, I was looking forward to seeing his recent film, The Gentlemen (2020), as it seemed to be a return to the kind of filmmaking that attracted me to Guy Ritchie films in the first place.Unfortunately, it seems Ritchie has been away from his core movies for so long that he's almost forgotten how to make them. The meta framing with Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam was clunky enough that even Hunnam's character was getting bored with the ""telling"" in the exposition provided by Grant's character. Sure, there were a few neat twists here and there, but it was trying so hard to be a meta-movie like Seven Psychopaths (2012) or The Player (1992) that it lost its focus. In the end, it spent too much time trying to interweave the narrator's narrative and the story narrative, and all it ended up with was a jumbled mess of a movie.I didn't feel like the action or cinematography (two elements that defined Ritchie films in the past) was lacking. This was mostly because so much of this movie is told to us via Hugh Grant. Perhaps this was also because the meaningful action didn't even end up being real, but rather the imagined ""movie version"" of events that played so counter to the characters and how they would act as to break the suspension of disbelief. I'd forgive doing this once, but it seemed to happen on more than one occasion, resulting in an annoying ""just kidding"" wink from the narrator far too often. At the very least, The Gentlemen does show the difference between boys trying to be tough and men who are actually tough.A Guy Ritchie film that tries, and fails, to reignite the magic from his first movies, I give The Gentlemen 2.5 stars out of 5.",guy ritchie film that tries fails reignite magic his first movies,ive enjoyed good portion guy ritchies filmmaking while many his more recent movies rely franchise appeal sherlock holmes 2009 man u n c l e 2015 aladdin 2019 are note i usually associate his style filmmaking with british heist film like lock stock two smoking barrels 1998 snatch 2000 consequently i was looking forward seeing his recent film gentlemen 2020 as it seemed be return kind filmmaking that attracted me guy ritchie films first place unfortunately it seems ritchie has been away his core movies so long that hes almost forgotten how make them meta framing with hugh grant charlie hunnam was clunky enough that even hunnams character was getting bored with telling exposition provided by grants character sure there were few neat twists here there but it was trying so hard be meta movie like seven psychopaths 2012 or player 1992 that it lost its focus end it spent too much time trying interweave narrators narrative story narrative all it ended up with was jumbled mess movie i didnt feel like action or cinematography two elements that defined ritchie films past was lacking this was mostly because so much this movie is told us via hugh grant perhaps this was also because meaningful action didnt even end up being real but rather imagined movie version events that played so counter characters how they would act as break suspension disbelief id forgive doing this once but it seemed happen more than one occasion resulting annoying just kidding wink narrator far too often at very least gentlemen does show difference between boys trying be tough men who are actually tough guy ritchie film that tries fails reignite magic his first movies i give gentlemen 2 5 stars out 5,0.4827371273712736,0.047940379403794045,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.38}"
3.0,Not my cup of tea,"I wanted to like this film. But I just couldn't. It wasn't comedic to me. And it didn't strike a cord of being a real-life engaging thriller to me either. It's very stylized. And although style can work in certain circumstances when the viewer is appropriately brought on-board. I felt like the plane left without me. A style really doesn't work if the characters become too artificial while trying to play-off an essence of reality at the same time.Much of the story about the main character (McConaughey's) is delivered as investigative conjecture from another character(Grant's). So as the narrator character reveals the main character's story, the narrator can later change the result of events we perceive by just revealing that the conjecture he presented before was inaccurate. This gets old really fast.Maybe this can work if the conjecture is absurd and funny or if the conjecture rings very true most of the time. That way it surprises the viewer when it's revealed to be wrong. But as I explained before, I didn't overall get a sense of either quality within the story-telling.Overall the film seemed very ambitious. But all of the pieces didn't seem to quite make sense to me together. And they might have been better off removing a few elements for this particular script.I wasn't too sympathetic for the characters I was supposed to be sympathetic for. I didn't understand the logic to some of the character decisions. Some of the moments of ""big reveals"" didn't seem too surprising to me. And a lot of the narration got annoying to me. More often than not it's better to show than tell the viewer what they need to know. I didn't think the voiceover was helpful in showing but telling. To put it simply, I felt it was more style than more substance. And the music didn't seem to help the storytelling to me either.I hope you like it if you see. But I also hope that if you have similar concerns and inclinations as me, that my review might spare you some time and/or money.

8.0,"Nothing too unexpected here, but it's funny and hugely entertaining","The Gentlemen is a return to the London gangster milieu where writer/director Guy Ritchie first made his name with films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). His first foray into this territory since the disappointing RocknRolla (2008), The Gentlemen comes at the end of over a decade making big-budget studio-backed crimes against cinema. Granted, the film seems stuck in the last decade in more ways than one, it's highly questionable that the only gay character is a slimy S&M proponent who'll sleep with pretty much anyone, its token female character barely even manages to rise to the level of tokenism, and Ritchie does absolutely nothing new here - if you've seen Lock, Stock or snatch., you'll know pretty much exactly what to expect - but The Gentlemen is still hugely entertaining. Most of the jokes land, the dialogue is as sharp and expletive-laden as ever, the cast are having a ball, and the self-reflexivity, although a little forced in places, works well for the most part. And yes, the plot is as derivative as it gets, but there's no denying Ritchie has injected real verve into what looks on paper like an inconsequential C-movie. The Gentlemen definitely won't change your life, but it will make you laugh.The film begins as sleazy private eye Fletcher (Hugh Grant) arrives unannounced at the home of Ray (Charlie Hunnam), right-hand man to Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey), a suave Oxford-educated American ex-pat who controls a huge marijuana empire in London, valued at around £400 million. Several months prior, Fletcher was hired by tabloid editor Big Dave (the great Eddie Marsan) to dig up dirt on Pearson with the aim to ruin him - Dave's revenge for Pearson blanking him at a gala. Fletcher has written a screenplay based on his investigation (titled Bush) and tells Ray that unless Pearson pays him £20 million, he will hand over everything he has to Dave. Meanwhile, Pearson has decided to sell his whole operation, but when word gets out, all hell breaks loose, as the various interested parties vie for advantage. Most of the subsequent film takes the form of Fletcher narrating his exploits to Ray, explaining how he learned so much about Pearson and what he does. Along the way, we meet characters such as Rosalind (Michelle Dockery), Pearson's ruthless and unflappable ""cockney Cleopatra"" wife, who runs a garage with an all-female staff; Berger (Jeremy Strong), Pearson's preferred buyer; Dry Eye (Henry Golding), the ambitious but brutal scion of a Chinese syndicate, who hopes to undermine Berger; Coach (a scene-stealing Colin Farrell), who runs a boxing gym for troubled youths and who inadvertently finds himself in the middle of everything; a plethora of property-rich-but-cash-poor landed gentry who are essential to Pearson's empire; a Russian oligarch; and a street gang called The Toddlers.Aesthetically, The Gentlemen is very much in the mould of Ritchie's previous gangster movies. Because Fletcher frames his narration as a screenplay, it allows Ritchie to employ a multitude of self-reflexive devices - a smash cut coinciding with Fletcher asking Ray to visualise a smash cut; voiceover transitioning into spoken dialogue; on-screen captions telling us who's who; animated maps; YouTube fight porn (don't ask); freeze-frames; rewinds; a shot of film running through a projector etc. At one point, Fletcher is discussing the merits of anamorphic (2.39:1) over 1.78:1, and the film's aspect ratio changes accordingly. At another, he's arguing for the merits of 35mm celluloid over digital, saying he likes the grain of celluloid photography, and the film duly switches formats. Such playfulness means that it never for a second takes itself too seriously, with probably the most self-reflexive moment coming towards the end, when we visit Miramax's offices in London (Miramax produced the movie), and we see a poster for Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015). All of this is immensely fun, with the more you know about the mechanics of assembling a film, the more humorously self-reflexive the film becomes - Fletcher even acknowledges his own role as an unreliable narrator.In terms of themes, the most obvious is something Ritchie has examined before - the idea that the economic divide between gangsters and aristocrats masks their practical similarities. Pearson straddles this divide; he's a gangster, but so too is he an aristocrat (in all but name), and the smooth running of his business depends on both classes - the aristocrats who he needs to grow his product (for reasons that constitute a bit of a spoiler, so I'm not going to get into it) and the gangsters who distribute that product. The clash between the pompous insularity of the English upper class and the perceived uncouthness of the lower class has been done to death in both literature (Wuthering Heights (1847) springs to mind) and film (Performance (1970), for example), and although Ritchie doesn't say anything even remotely new about it, it still forms an interesting textural background - gentrification is ever-present; there are ironic references to the posh areas of Croydon; Ray, a working-class Newcastle native, is a cleanliness freak who eats wagyu steak and lives in a mansion, and when he's dispatched on a mission to an uncivilised working-class area, he explains he ""just hates them junkies,"" seeing them as very much his social inferiors.One of the most central scenes sees a group of obnoxious privileged teens holed up in a council flat, whilst on the street below, a gang of machete-wielding delinquents terrorise the neighbourhood. As Ray and his men clash with the gang, there's a real sense of old vs. new - traditional gangsters fighting it out with internet-savvy hoodlums who don't give a damn about tradition or respect. There are a lot of laughs to be had with these issues, such as Ray and Coach having problems pronouncing the name Phuc. And again, none of this is presented as even remotely serious.The biggest problems with the film are probably its lack of depth, and the familiarity of the presentation, characters, and milieu - there's nothing here you haven't seen in previous Ritchie films. And as you would expect, there isn't much in the way of emotional maturity or narrative complexity. It's all very surface-level, and it makes no apologies for such.Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed The Gentlemen. It's a funny as hell caper and the actors are clearly having terrific fun. It might be formulaic and overly familiar, but it's also immensely enjoyable.",nothing too unexpected here but its funny hugely entertaining,gentlemen is return london gangster milieu where writer
