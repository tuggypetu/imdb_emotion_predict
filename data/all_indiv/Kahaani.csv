10.0,"A rare combination of performance, script, direction, and aesthetics that will leave you stunned","Leave your bag of popcorn outside the theater. You would honestly not have the time to crunch it as you watch this fantastic film with bated breath. For Kahaani is a ride so thrilling, your mind would be tripping with a million possibilities, even as your tongue invariably ends up either tied, or hanging in the air with anticipation.Kahaani is essentially the story of a heavily pregnant London based Tamil woman's search for her missing Bengali husband in Kolkata, underplayed exuberantly by Vidya Balan. The supporting cast comprises a helpful cop Parambrata, a selfish detective - Siddiqui, an eccentric life insurance agent - Saswata, and a bhadralok Police officer - Khwaraj, and last but not the least, of a 300+ year old city - Kolkata seeped in the throes of celebrating the mother of all festivals - Durga Puja.The film unfolds like the pages of a gripping novel by Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes and is shot like that of an Alfred Hitchcock or a Satyajit Ray. Using real people, places, and situations to underline the nuances of the story is a task that's handled brilliantly by director Sujoy Ghosh (also the co writer) whose recent claim to shame - an abysmal Aladdin, or a horrendous Home Delivery shall soon be forgotten just as Madhur Bhandarkar's debut dud was.In addition to the sterling performances and the plot is the terrific technical support. Be it Amitabh Bacchan's rendition of Tagore's 'Ekla Chalo Re', the background songs (mostly of RD Burman), playing innocently as the characters travel the length and breadth of the city, the costumes by Sabyasachi, the 'just right and yet dramatic' background score, the non-condescending cinematography that captures the city as if it were a character, and the supreme screenplay with a spattering of real Bengali, act as just the right spices to turn this into a delicious dish, that's both exotic as well as commonplace.Watch this film to experience something so satiating, you would surely ask for more (a rare for a thriller!). I give this a 10/10 not just because this is one of the best thrillers ever made in India, but definitely one of the best films to have ever come out of Bollywood. Kudos to the whole team! Trust me! Ami Sotthi Bolcchi!P.S: Please do not discuss the story with anyone else, unless they have watched this film.",rare combination performance script direction aesthetics that will leave you stunned,leave your bag popcorn outside theater you would honestly not have time crunch it as you watch this fantastic film with bated breath kahaani is ride so thrilling your mind would be tripping with million possibilities even as your tongue invariably ends up either tied or hanging air with anticipation kahaani is essentially story heavily pregnant london based tamil womans search her missing bengali husband kolkata underplayed exuberantly by vidya balan supporting cast comprises helpful cop parambrata selfish detective siddiqui eccentric life insurance agent saswata bhadralok police officer khwaraj last but not least 300 year old city kolkata seeped throes celebrating mother all festivals durga puja film unfolds like pages gripping novel by agatha christie or sherlock holmes is shot like that alfred hitchcock or satyajit ray using real people places situations underline nuances story is task thats handled brilliantly by director sujoy ghosh also co writer whose recent claim shame abysmal aladdin or horrendous home delivery shall soon be forgotten just as madhur bhandarkars debut dud was addition sterling performances plot is terrific technical support be it amitabh bacchans rendition tagores ekla chalo re background songs mostly rd burman playing innocently as characters travel length breadth city costumes by sabyasachi just right yet dramatic background score non condescending cinematography that captures city as if it were character supreme screenplay with spattering real bengali act as just right spices turn this into delicious dish thats both exotic as well as commonplace watch this film experience something so satiating you would surely ask more rare thriller i give this 10 10 not just because this is one best thrillers ever made india but definitely one best films have ever come out bollywood kudos whole team trust me ami sotthi bolcchi p s please do not discuss story with anyone else unless they have watched this film,0.570194003527337,0.24365079365079367,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,Vidya Balan rocks in Kahaani!,"Kahaani directed by Sujoy Ghosh is one of the most finest,efficient thrillers I have witnessed in recent times.The first half may be a bit stretched but still its good but it is the second half that keeps you engaged thoroughly and the climax is superb.Story:- Vidya Bagchi(Vidya Balan) playing the helpless , who has arrived from London to Kolkata in search of her missing husband Arnab. With a sympathetic cop helping her on this mission, Vidya combs every corner of Kolkata. But all leads go cold – the guest-house he was staying at, the National Data Center where he'd been assigned, even the Indian immigration authorities have no records of Arnab Bagchi. When it seems like her husband's disappearance might be inexplicably linked to a most-wanted terrorist, Vidya pokes her nose around in dangerous places, angering the Intelligence Bureau that is trying desperately to keep some secrets hidden.Sujoy Ghosh,who directed the disastrous Aladin in 2009, is excellent this time.Although there are many sequences in Kahaani which work,but since mentioning them would spoil the fun.The screenplay is taut and brave.The dialogs are very good.The editors could have trimmed the movie,to make it more sharper.The cinematography by Setu is stunning.The locales of Kolkata are a treat to the eye.The music is very good.""Ami Shotti Bolchi"" sung by Usha Uthup and ""Ekla Cholo Re"" sung by Amitabh Bachchan stand out.Performances:- Vidya Balan rocks in Kahaani.She is an actor to watch out for.She is amazing.Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana is sweet.Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan,the Intelligence Bureau officer is superb.Saswata Chatterjee is good too.Special mention of the two boys,one in the Mona Lisa hotel and the other as the tea vendor are cute.Amitabh Bachchan's narration at the culmination is fine.I am giving nine out of ten for Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani.It is not only to be watched for fans of Vidya Balan but it is also for those who are not.Its your loss,if you miss it.",vidya balan rocks kahaani,kahaani directed by sujoy ghosh is one most finest efficient thrillers i have witnessed recent times first half may be bit stretched but still its good but it is second half that keeps you engaged thoroughly climax is superb story vidya bagchi vidya balan playing helpless who has arrived london kolkata search her missing husband arnab with sympathetic cop helping her this mission vidya combs every corner kolkata but all leads go cold guest house he was staying at national data center where hed been assigned even indian immigration authorities have no records arnab bagchi when it seems like her husbands disappearance might be inexplicably linked most wanted terrorist vidya pokes her nose around dangerous places angering intelligence bureau that is trying desperately keep some secrets hidden sujoy ghosh who directed disastrous aladin 2009 is excellent this time although there are many sequences kahaani which work but since mentioning them would spoil fun screenplay is taut brave dialogs are very good editors could have trimmed movie make it more sharper cinematography by setu is stunning locales kolkata are treat eye music is very good ami shotti bolchi sung by usha uthup ekla cholo re sung by amitabh bachchan stand out performances vidya balan rocks kahaani she is actor watch out she is amazing parambrata chatterjee as rana is sweet nawazuddin siddiqui as khan intelligence bureau officer is superb saswata chatterjee is good too special mention two boys one mona lisa hotel other as tea vendor are cute amitabh bachchans narration at culmination is fine i am giving nine out ten sujoy ghoshs kahaani it is not only be watched fans vidya balan but it is also those who are not its your loss if you miss it,0.5934169884169884,0.2356435006435006,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"Kahani -- A long awaited Gripping, Original Story with Awesome Direction","Genre --- Suspense, DramaReview -- Kahani is indeed a worth for your money. A sincere effort to portray an incredible story, which would leave you baffled, would leave you keep guessing what is going on and what would happen next. We have seen several suspense movies that have a good build up but are utter disappointing in the end. Even after the climax, it would keep surprising you till last shot. Truly a nice movie that you can with you Family and kids without hesitation. No abusive language, no ""story Ki demand"" type intimate shots. A clean and gripping storyline. I liked that fact that story did not pushed a possible romantic element neither unneeded songs between characters and kept it straight and focused.Story of Girl (Vidya) looking for her missing husband, is just the start. Movie is shot is Kolkata with characters that are real, you can relate and can smile to natural gestures. Movie keeps you clutched to your seat. Its a story of nice people stuck in their own mess up routine, offer help to the pregnant lady. Even with new actors, jumping in with their cameo every now and then, each has done full justice to their role.The story has been wisely written binding intelligent writing along with actual Kolkata.Verdict-- If you have been awaiting for a Good Bollywood Flick, with original narration and quality acting, the movie worth's every penny. A pleasure to watch with family or friends.Music -- Consists of two songs, different from stream line cinema. Amitabh Bachhan has brought a new spirit to Rabindra Da's ""Ekla Chalo Re"". The other song -- ""Ammi Shotti Bolchi"" is a authentic rock song on Kolkata theme in Usha Utthup's evergreen Bengali voice.Rating -- 8.5/10http://bollywoodwaale.com/movies.php?movieid=14Anjaneai",kahani long awaited gripping original story with awesome direction,genre suspense dramareview kahani is indeed worth your money sincere effort portray incredible story which would leave you baffled would leave you keep guessing what is going what would happen next we have seen several suspense movies that have good build up but are utter disappointing end even after climax it would keep surprising you till last shot truly nice movie that you can with you family kids without hesitation no abusive language no story ki demand type intimate shots clean gripping storyline i liked that fact that story did not pushed possible romantic element neither unneeded songs between characters kept it straight focused story girl vidya looking her missing husband is just start movie is shot is kolkata with characters that are real you can relate can smile natural gestures movie keeps you clutched your seat its story nice people stuck their own mess up routine offer help pregnant lady even with new actors jumping with their cameo every now then each has done full justice their role story has been wisely written binding intelligent writing along with actual kolkata verdict if you have been awaiting good bollywood flick with original narration quality acting movie worths every penny pleasure watch with family or friends music consists two songs different stream line cinema amitabh bachhan has brought new spirit rabindra das ekla chalo re other song ammi shotti bolchi is authentic rock song kolkata theme usha utthups evergreen bengali voice rating 8 5 10,0.558946608946609,0.2886363636363636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,... The Changing Face of Indian Cinema.,"Let me say right now that this is not your usual Bollywood run-of-the-mill. If you are expecting typical Bollywood masala with hide and seek romance, dancing around trees, superhero fight scenes and 'filmy' dialogue, you will find it in the remaining 999 films that the Indian film industry has on the 2012 assembly line. What works for ""Kahaani"" is its atypical narration arising from a well written story, first class cinematography in tandem with good soundtrack, and the performance of a leading actress whose very mention signals the changing face of Indian cinema.Arriving from London, a heavily pregnant Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) heads straight to the Kalighat police station in Kolkata to enquire about her missing husband. With the help of Rana (Parambrata Chatterjee), a rookie cop, Vidya begins to unravel the mystery behind her husband Arnab's disappearance. Together, their investigation leads to dead ends, but not before learning that Arnab may be linked to a terrorist agent operating as a mole within the Indian Intelligence Bureau. Wrestling with this possibility, Vidya finds herself digging into a high profile federal cover-up, even as an assassin trails her every move.Co-written by director Sujoy Ghosh, ""Kahaani"" is a well crafted thriller that is simply too good by Bollywood standards, current or past. Gosh has not only set a new benchmark in Indian cinema, his overall production quality is far superior to some of his counterparts across the globe. Even so, the true mettle of his work is in resisting the temptation to glorify India's stand on terrorism through nation-wide propaganda. Instead, Gosh pays close attention to the screenplay and how it develops through the narration. Pacing is consistent with a serious tone, but well punctuated with some suspense driven moments and subtle humor when you least expect it. Another strongpoint is in keeping the audience guessing all the way to the diabolical twist in the end. To avoid spoiling the surprise, I will just say that this could be borrowed from a certain Angelina Jolie film, but be that as it may, the conclusion here is totally unpredictable and forms the icing on the cake. There are some factual and chronological goofs but there is no point going there because no film is 100% perfect.Dating back to the late 17th century, cinematography captures the historical essence of one of India's oldest cities – a 300 year old artifact if you wish – in superb celluloid rendition. Gosh gives Kolkata a pulsating heart without unnecessary exaggeration, while simultaneously capturing the hustle and bustle and nooks and crannies of the city with deft camera work. Using this huge backdrop along with the festival of all festivals, The Durga Puja, Gosh underlines the film's formidable theme of motherhood in seamlessly integrating the fragility of a woman with her in-built yet God-given power to sustain life. From joy to heart-wrenching sorrow, Vidya Balan personifies this ideology with perfection. Fresh off the critical success of ""The Dirty Picture"", Balan is emerging as a powerful force in female driven plots. While this could very well change the perception on Indian cinema, this a welcome change and one that is long overdue. I am smitten as I am awestruck. Also worth mentioning are Parambrata Chatterjee as Rana and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a difficult IB agent. Together, their roles add vital support to Balan's as well as holding up the plot structure.As this is my first Hindi movie review, I only hope that I have given this movie the recognition it deserves. Considering my fondness with all things Hollywood, Ms. Vidya Balan and director Sujoy Ghosh have renewed my faith in Indian cinema. I cannot wait to see Balan's next movie.

9.0,Kahaani Is An Enthralling Watch :D,Who would expect that someone who directed 'Home Delivery' could create magic. Sujoy Ghosh's 'Kahaani' is a mouth watering treat for any movie lover. Right from the very beginning till the end the tight narrative keeps the viewer on his toes without any hiccups whatsoever. Starring Vidya Balan as Vidya Bagchi(Bidya Bagchi) as a wife who is in search of his husband Arnab Bagchi and in its course arrives in Kolkata all the way from London even though she is pregnant. The story follows her search at the same time playing with your mind with many twists and turns. After a long time have I seen a film in which every actor has given a peach of a performance and thus requires a special mention. From Parambrata Chatterjee who plays the role of inspector Rana who helps Vidya find her husband to Office Khan played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui to even Saaswata Chatterjeeas who plays the serial killer Bob every one is brilliant. I am really looking forward to more actors from the Bangla film industry to shine in Bollywood. The script is tight with loop holes you don't even bother worrying about and to add to that the haunting background score that gives you the true feeling of a thriller. Though it awkwardly seems a bit longer than its 2 hour running time I still won't mind watching it again. And yes Vidya Balan our very own Meryl Streep is almost certain to get another filmfare and national award. Of course the year has just started but i might just be disappointed if she doesn't get it. Ha! really satisfied with Kahaani.7.5/10 for Kahaani and another 0.5 for the collective acting performances of the cast.

10.0,A Nutshell Review: Kahaani,"The film begins in 2008, where we bear witness to an unnamed man whose identity is hidden behind a gas mask, experimenting with a lethal chemical gas on lab rats, before we get to the city of Kolkata where the same weapon of mass destruction got used in a terrorist attack on a subway train that unfortunately wasn't stopped in time. This almost stand-alone setup and prologue will keep you guessing its significance to its story, since the film continues two years later, where Balan's Mrs Vidya Bagchi arrives in the same Indian city from London in search of her husband Arnab (Abir Chatterjee), who as a software engineer worked at the National Data Centre and maintained daily contact until his sudden disappearance two weeks before, with the uncharacteristic cessation of contact prompting his wife to travel thousands of miles to look for him.Worried, the heavily pregnant Vidya heads straight to the local police to file a missing persons report, and from there starts to visit some of the regular joints her husband could have been in, including his hotel room which had absolutely no traces of the man, nor with people she encountered at those places having any recollection of having seen him, based on their hastily taken matrimonial photo. Assisted by policeman Rana (Parambrata Chaterjee), a slight, mild mannered cop, they soon stumble upon an investigative web filled with unanswered mysteries, and a bewildering suggestion that her husband may not be who he had claimed to be all along. The name Milan Damji gets floated about, a government agent in the mould of Jason Bourne, who may hold the key to Arnab's disappearance, again with clues that he may be more than meets the eye, and at this point your imagination will start to run wild as to the myriad of possibilities the story written by Sujoy Ghosh could turn out.Ghosh also takes on directing responsibilities, and he has crafted one heck of an engaging thriller amongst some of the best I've seen with scheming twists and carefully plotted turns involving government officials, beat cops, and Intelligence Bureau officers led by the non- compromising Khan (Nawazuddin Sidiqui), who epitomizes a no-nonsense approach with a willing streak to sacrifice pawns to nab the king. With Vijay pushing for the truth, a slew of bodies start turning up courtesy of a hired killer set loose to silence everyone she talks to, giving rise to that sense of danger and death at every wrong turn, it's a closely matched up cat and mouse game everyone seems to be playing against one another on both sides of the law, with Khan's questionable tactics giving rise to the propensity of collateral damage authorities are willing to suffer for the sake of the greater good.But Ghosh also remembered to balance his superb thriller with emotional anchors, and does this brilliantly through his crafting and development of the protagonists Vijay and Rana, whom we journey together in their search for facts and truth. They play off each other's strengths like Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, with Rana's unassuming disposition balancing Vijay's sprightly nature and relentless determination, making this one of the best cop- civilian pairing I have ever seen as well, being all natural and therefore believable. Credit has to go to Vidya Balan for her sensitive portrayal as a woman hell bent on tracking down her loved one and seeking closure to the sudden mysteries in her life, and Parambrata Chaterjee for his portrayal of a man taking it upon himself to help, and unwittingly finding himself being attracted to and infatuated with someone he has sworn to protect as well. It is this forbidden attraction and romance that's underlying and brewing that he brings out well without going over the top, exhibiting loads of sentimentalism that worked wonders for their chemistry with each other.Production values are top notch. I absolutely love the gorgeous city of Kolkata which I've seldom seen in Indian films, and here we weave in and out the crowded, bustling city area and into much laid back neighbourhoods, with a fantastic capture of very natural misc-en- scene being a lovely ode to the city, featuring its sights, sounds, people such as the working class from tea sellers to master craftsmen, and festivals. Production designers Kaushik Das and Subrata Barik ensured a very natural look and feel, while cinematographer Setu didn't impress me much with his shaky cam technique that had plagued too many Hollywood films he tried to emulate, but thankfully the second half of the film decided to ditch that misguided documentary feel for camera work that's more sustainable and traditional. The music by Clinton Cerejo and Shekhar Ravjiani worked extremely well in the background without bringing in too much attention to itself, nor do we have jarring breakaway musical interludes to blunt the storyline. Such is how everything worked together to complement everything else in the making of the film, to churn out a result that's worthwhile of repeat viewings for clues that one may have missed the first time round. It's filmmaking and storytelling at its best, and even I was more than glad to have decided to watch this instead of postponing it. Kahaani propels itself into my shortlist as one of the best this year, and it is certainly highly recommended if you're desperately looking for an intelligent story, great performances, a film that went the whole nine yards in its desire to become a classic.",nutshell review kahaani,film begins 2008 where we bear witness unnamed man whose identity is hidden behind gas mask experimenting with

10.0,This is what story-telling is all about!!!,"First and foremost I would like to clear out one thing about me.I am a Bengali but in spite of the fact that I got a mesmerizing view of the Bengali culture and the city of joy-Kolkata (which I haven't visited for ages), this review is not biased.Ever wished you watched a movie that left you completely spellbound? Yes this is one of those movies that lingers on in your head even after you leave the movie theater.The star cast right from Vidya Balan(as Vidya Bagchi),ParambrataChattopadhyay(as police offer Satyoki Sinha/Rana),Nawazuddin Siddiqui(as second-in command Intelligence Beaureu),Saswata Chatterjee(as a hired assassin),Kharaj Mukherjee as a kind cop to the manager of Mona Lisa hotel and lastly the two kids who interact with Vidya is simply amazing.There are several high points in the film.Vidya as the portrayal of the pregnant woman delivers a range of emotions.She is at times tough and firm on finding her missing husband.At times, she is vulnerable,frustrated because of the missing clues. She is charming in the way she talks with the kids and playful in the bus-ride with officer Rana.Then the subtlety with which Rana emotes the love he feels for Vidya and the hesitation while picking locks to find out evidences.The brash hard talk act by officer Khan and then the evil menacing act by Bob Biswaas.Brilliant!!Moreover Sujoy Ghosh(the director) uses Vidya's pregnancy cleverly- every time she trips or even sweats too hard, you become afraid.The story totally grips you and leaves you at a dramatic high.And what can I say about the climax.Tremendous shock value!There have been very few times when I have experienced such pin-drop silence in the theater.Take a bow Sujoy..You have given Bollywood a gem of a thriller.For those fed up with the dark and gritty underbelly of Mumbai and the bylanes of old Delhi in recent movies, there are splendid sights of Kolkata and the iconic Durga Puja.It's a treat to watch the Howrah bridge,Hoogly river and the Victoria Memorial.Regarding music.Its great.The movie starts on a good note with ""Ami Shotti Bolchi"" and Amitabh Bachhan's rendition of Tagore's famous song ""Jodi tor dak shune"" elevates the mood to a completely different level.The director keeps the narrative clutter-free, sans any songs or side-track.Kahaani shows that when everything falls in place for a film — story, writing, acting, editing, cinematography, etc — things can't go wrong. Kahaani is one such film; everything's right about it.Watch Kahaani.

8.0,A treat of a film and a bomb of a Vidya.,"Kahaani is a wonderful, taut thriller which will keep the viewers on the edge of their seat. It is filmed rather professionally, with fantastic cinematography and great sound and score. The portrayal of Kolkatta may not be the most accurate and of the most positive, but the city is beautifully shot and is efficiently used to present the story. Sujoy Ghosh directs this feature with great mastery - Kahaani is a thrilling movie experience, thanks to his skillful direction and the impressive writing. The characters are very well presented and characterised, and the suspense is only heightened as the proceedings unfold. The film is of course a good example of a complete package, and this package wouldn't have been complete without the presence of a terrific Vidya Balan. This lady's career seems to be reaching impossible heights as she does not tire of delivering one great performance after the other. Her brilliantly understated performance here is another astonishing portrait of strength and maturity. She is well supported by several actors, all of whom give credible performances and make the film work. Kahaani is overall a superior piece of storytelling and an altogether worthy effort.

8.0,"The refreshing combination of Parambrata and Balan and the motley of emotions and the ease with which they exude them in ""Kahaani"" make for an outstanding watch.","Setu's account of Kolkata is delightedly sincere and not superfluous cinematography - the dynamic colours and the simplicity of the artless lanes of Kolkata, admiringly, have not been lost in rhetoric black and white. The same forthrightness has mirrored to a huge extent in Suresh Nair and Sujoy Ghosh's masterful and impressive narration of Bagchi's fable of lost and deeply lost until found.Vidya Bagchi's (Vidya Balan) hunt for her lost husband Arnab Bagchi (Indraneil Sengupta) brings her down to Kolkata from London. With a seven-month old baby magnifying her power, an infinite exploration of the byways of Kolkata with the help of a local policeman Satyoki Sinha (Parambrata Chattopadhyay) begins. Disordered links and remainders of Vidya's past conversations with Arnab are her fragile hopes. Undeterred, the firewall specialist rummages through the tightly encrypted codes of the mystery, webbed by even more securely encrusted faces. The refreshing combination of Parambrata and Balan and the motley of emotions and the ease with which they exude them in ""Kahaani"" make for an outstanding watch. Balan's ability to tailor her sentiments - sympathy, anger and despair - multiplies the strength of her character. The swiftness of the movie leaves no time for the audience to mentally prepare for an upcoming situation. While Vidya accepts herself as ""Bidya""in the City of Joy, gifts a chocolate to the kid in the lodge and breaks the lock of National Data Centre; the contract killer Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee) playfully murders people and Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) smokes out his dedication towards his work besides a mouthful of white air. Just when a wide array of emotions are at their peak and the frantic search is riding high, Amitabh Bachhan's rendition of Tagore's famous song ""Jodi tor dak shune"" transfers the mood to a completely different level. The festive mood of the city, the preceding and the succeeding of it, the red of sindoor and the expressions of the idols of Durga have been phenomenally well-utlised in the movie. Balan is a breeze of fresh air in Bollywood, which is suffering from the curves of furniture heroines and ""Kahaani"", another robust step after the recent ""The Dirty Picture"" towards reinforcing the position of heroines in a traditionally hero-driven Bollywood. The subtlety with which the soul of the city has been interlaced in the screenplay, while not losing grasp on the flow of the story even for a moment, is a testimony of effectual storytelling. There is not a single scene in the movie where Parambrata has been overshadowed by the presence of Balan. His acting skills are distinctly sharp and flowing. Sujoy Ghosh's choice of actors for the various characters in ""Kahaani"" has made an immense contribution towards the kind of impact it leaves on the viewers long after they abandon the theatre. After all, ""Shotti"" sounds better as ""Shotti"", not ""Sotti"". The climax, even though prudent and reasonably well-baked, is slightly dramatic and seems to conclude the movie before clearly justifying the actions of Vidya and Satyoki, especially the latter. The momentum of the story towards the end beats its own record and the circumstances merging with the mood of the city seems to be not so much of a coincidence. Bagchi's ""Kahaani"" is one of those that would define tougher standards for the forthcoming Fridays. Why on earth would you like to miss the benchmark? Watch it.

6.0,"Shake, Shake, Shake! Shake Your Movie!","For the first time ever, I think I'm docking 3 points just for the cinematography alone. At its heart, Kahaani is a compelling story with strong acting and good character depth, as well as a clear tone and effective disturbing moments and imagery, such as that of the rats being gassed by an apathetic psychopath in the opening frames to set the mood for the rest of the film. The characters may not be fantastic as one might expect from a masterpiece of a film, but they certainly are effective in the film, and the acting from our lead actress Vidya Balan rises far above the film's shortcomings.My main gripe is with a very simple part of the cinematography. There is simply way too much shaky cam to the point of becoming nauseating. There's very few moments in which the camera stays still, and when they happen they seem to be by coincidence or by mistake since even the dullest moments and the most extreme bits are shot with exactly the same constant shakiness. This film seems to have taken to heart one of the worst tropes plaguing Hollywood films nowadays, and though it takes several that make the film look much more well-paced and stylish than the typical Bollywood romp, this one trope does more than undo what good was done with the cinematography. Back when Michael Bay's 13 Hours came out, I felt like it might be the first Bay film I enjoyed, but due to some inappropriate shaky cam, I had to drop it, and this film is much higher in quality with much much worse shaky cam.That being said, there's plenty to like in the film. The setup is very cleverly manipulative for a thriller film. Having our main hero as a pregnant woman is one that sounds ridiculous in premise, but her motivation makes a lot of sense, and what results is a pregnant hero being in the last situation they should be in. The story, while not too thought-provoking, has enough twists and turns and revelations to keep it from being dull and unimaginative. It sounds cliche and silly, but I found myself more invested than I felt I should have been, and for that reason I have to give the film a positive rating.Though I'm sure this film might seem really unique for Bollywood fans, it feels really familiar for me here in North America. That being said, it's certainly better than most films going for this style aside from the obnoxious shaky cam.",shake shake shake shake your movie,first time ever i think im docking 3 points just cinematography alone at its heart kahaani is compelling story with strong acting good character depth as well as clear tone effective disturbing moments imagery such as that rats being gassed by apathetic psychopath opening frames set mood rest film characters may not be fantastic as one might expect masterpiece film but they certainly are effective film acting our lead actress vidya balan rises far above films shortcomings my main gripe is with very simple part cinematography there is simply way too much shaky cam point becoming nauseating theres very few moments which camera stays still when they happen they seem be by coincidence or by mistake since even dullest moments most extreme bits are shot with exactly same constant shakiness this film seems have taken heart one worst tropes plaguing hollywood films nowadays though it takes several that make film look much more well paced stylish than typical bollywood romp this one trope does more than undo what good was done with cinematography back when michael bays 13 hours came out i felt like it might be first bay film i enjoyed but due some inappropriate shaky cam i had drop it this film is much higher quality with much much worse shaky cam that being said theres plenty like film setup is very cleverly manipulative thriller film having our main hero as pregnant woman is one that sounds ridiculous premise but her motivation makes lot sense what results is pregnant hero being last situation they should be story while not too thought provoking has enough twists turns revelations keep it being dull unimaginative it sounds cliche silly but i found myself more invested than i felt i should have been that reason i have give film positive rating though im sure this film might seem really unique bollywood fans it feels really familiar me here north america that being said its certainly better than most films going this style aside obnoxious shaky cam,0.5356526417052734,0.12292207792207793,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,A Compact thriller which should be seen to witness that great thrillers are made in India too :),"A perfect noir or thriller is like a Cornetto Ice-cream which you start licking with excitement that doesn't fizzle away in the course of your action. In fact temptation gets multiplied as your taste bud is surprised with hidden nuts, choco chips, wafers along with added flavor which makes one forget about everything. In the very end one finds that unexpected solid chunk of chocolate whose aroma stays in your mouth for hours. Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani is one such taut thriller that will engross you with interesting twists and turns gradually reaching the climax that takes a complete somersault. From the very first scene of a man in a gas mask testing some lethal chemicals on rats in a lab, Kahaani has you gripped. And then enters Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant women in an unknown city in search of her husband Arnab Bagchi who is a scientist working in NDC, Kolkata. There lies the mystery as from every corner Mrs Bagchi is proved that her husband hadn't been to this city. Even his existence seems to be a mere figment of imagination. Things get complicated as IB department of country shows interest in the case. Revealing a single suspense of this gripping thriller will be a crime and it is must watch for all lovers of suspense thriller. Sujoy Ghosh's script as well as direction is restrained yet poignant with metaphors revolving around Maa Durga and her fight with Asura (the demon). It is one of the rare scenarios where the script and the execution respect audience intelligence. In fact the ending compels the audience to revisit the scenarios and then one realizes the dots do connect. That's the most successful poi of this riveting thriller which can be compared to best of the thrillers in the world. The cone of this Cornetto is city of Joy Kolkata who is the true protagonist of the tale. The violence lurking in the by-lanes of the city, the mystery flowing with the murmuring sound of the Ganges, there is an air of conspiracy and Ghosh's script rightly captures that. Ritesh Shah who wrote the dialogs of the film deserves mention to consummately penning down the thoughts of Ghosh. Thankfully there is no cliché involving Kolkata which were shown in earlier film made on this city. Adding to the beauty there is Setu's camera-work which portrays Kolkata like never before in Hindi celluloid. Ghosh is gifted with brilliant technical team who did their best to make a captivating thriller in such a shoestring budget. Namrata Rao is another ""hero"" of the film. She gave the razor sharp cuts much needed in a thriller like this and her editing abilities will surely get her phone ringing for more thrillers. The background score did the much needed haunting effect to compliment the proceeding without going overboard. There are two songs in the film. ""Ami Sotti Bolchi"" which is there in the beginning is kind of introduction to the city as well as story. Usha Utthup's voice creates the aura of suspense. Amitabh Bachchan rendered his voice to Tagore's ""ekla chalo re"" which somehow worked. Vidya Balan is the pillar of Kahaani. Her character V(B)idya Bagchi is epitome of strong quintessential woman who is strong to take care of herself and at the same time vulnerable to regular emotions of life. This is the role which actresses will die for and luckily the role chose Vidya Balan who is beyond competition. One of the finest actress of our generation she can display any role with perfection. From Ishqiya to Paa, No one Killed Jessica she went a notch higher with The Dirty picture and now sealed the top spot with ""Kahaani"". She deserves the best actress awards once again. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the loud mouthed IB office Khan had superb screen presence. His voice modulation will lead him to such meatier roles in near future. Parambrata Chatterjee aptly cast as Inspector Sinha added the soft side to the story with his unsaid love for Vidya. He was powerful even when he didn't mouth any dialogs through his expressive eyes. Saswata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas was scene stealer. Whenever he landed on screen people knew something is going to happen and with his expression he just stole the show. One of the finest actors in Bengal today, he must get noticed after this brilliant performance, in national circuits as well. His scenes with Vidya in the metro station just prior and after the interval are one of the best sequences of the film. Revealing his character will die down certain elements of suspense. Kharaj Mukherjee as podge thana head was adequate and provided some comic relief without getting too loud. Indraneil Sengupta, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Darshan Jariwala, Falguni Chatterjee (as manager of Monalisa lodge) let their presence felt. Special mention to the two kids who can give the big stars run for their money. Kahaani again proved Story is the real winner. If you have a good story you can compromise on budget and still make a engaging film. Kahaani should become a guide book for those who want to make thrillers. With Agent Vinod,Shanghai,Talaash on the cards hopefully good thrillers will revive in celluloid. Till then salute to the whole team of Kahaani and hope Sujoy Ghosh forgets his ""Alladin"" days and make another thriller as riveting as Kahaani.

10.0,"Kahaani Review: Scintillating Blockbuster, Must Watch","There are a few movies which will keep you glued to the screen. You will be sitting on the edge of the seat and your mind will be making a million possible permutations to deduce what will happen next. Very few of them come from Bollywood. If ever there was a blockbuster movie from Bollywood, Kahaani is better than that. Read on to know why Kahaani is a must watch.Plot: It's a crowded metro. Hundreds of travellers are waiting to reach their destination. They are killed with a chemical weapon. Two years later, Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) is a pregnant woman comes to India in search of her husband, Arnab Bagchi (Indraneel Sengupta) who has been missing. She can't find a trace of him and is determined to solve the puzzle. In the search for Arnab, Vidya stumbles on Milan Damji who is a lookalike of her husband and is a prime accused in the metro attack.All the clues to the case are being eliminated one by one. The Intelligence Bureau is involved and the hunt is on. Vidya is being helped by a local police officer Rana alias Satyaki (Parambrata Chattopadhyay). They are warned by the Intelligence Bureau to stay away but how long can they continue their search? Why was Arnab missing? What is his identity? Will he ever be found? These are, but a few questions that the story will answer you. Be ready to be taken on a roller-coaster ride.Analysis: The movie is a drama-thriller. This genre requires exquisite attention to detail and a very well written script. A small blunder can make or break your movie. Kahaani has it all. With a brilliant story (Sujoy Ghosh and Advaita Kala) and a screenplay that runs along at a pace that will make you glued to the screen, the director has paid attention to every possible detail to ensure nothing is left in a hush.Coming to performances by the cast, Parambrata Chattopadhyay as Rana is subtle and delivers a splendid performance. He is a well-known figure in Bengali cinema and his entry to Bollywood could not have been better. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, as the IB Deputy Director, is just picture perfect. It is tough to imagine that he is the same character who played the pickpocket in Munnabhai MBBS. In a role as a ruthless cop, he does ample justice to the role and delivers a power packed performance.Rest of the cast; Saswata Chatterjee as a hit man, Darshan Jariwala as the former IB agent, Indraneel Sengupta as the rouge agent Milan Damji and as Arnab Bagchi, and every other member of the cast have delivered wonderful performances and not one of them looked out of place.Finally coming to Vidya Balan, what do I say about her? With Five brilliant performances in a row, she is unstoppable. She manages to reinvent and elevate herself with every performance and in Kahaani she just does that all over again. If The Dirty Picture won her rave comments from even the harshest of critics, Kahaani has just pushed the barrier a few notches higher.She not only carries out the role with complete perfection, she looks every bit of the character that is written for her. She has conveniently steered way ahead of her competitors to stake the claim as the best actress in India. The review is stretching out too long or else I could have written an entire essay on how brilliant her performance was.The director Sujoy Gosh has just opened the gates to endless praise. He has handled the subject in a manner that would shut even the harshest of critics. The element of suspense is kept throughout the movie and not once does the script turn out predictable. Crisp dialogs, backed by wonderful performance just makes it all the more better.The camera work by Setu is apt; Screenplay by Sujoy Ghosh, Suresh Nair and Nikhil Vyas is just perfectly paced, Editing by Namrata Rao is crisp, and costumes by Sabyasachi Mukherjee (for Vidya Balan) and Suchismita Dasgupta just blend into the story perfectly. Music by Vishal Shekar is subtle and the rendition of Ekla Chalo Re by Amitabh Bachchan is just fantastic. In the end, the movie is a case of all the right things at the right place in the right hands.StudentLive's Verdict: I will just keep this short, Kahaani is a must watch. If Paan Singh Tomar started a different trend in Bollywood, Kahaani just takes it further. Don't even think of giving this one a miss. I will go with 4.5 out of 5 for Sujoy Gosh's Kahaani. It is a wonderful gift to cinema on Women's day and Holi.P.S: Pardon me for the slightly lengthy review, Kahaani deserves every bit of praise.

8.0,A well-written and worthy desi espionage thriller!,"Vidya Balan seems to be riding the crest these days. After pulling off three movies, Ishqiya, No One Killed Jessica and 'The Dirty Picture' almost as the sole lead, and winning a national award for her last entrée, she has hit the sweet spot yet again with this week's release 'Kahaani', a suspense thriller set in Kolkata. Just as the trailers suggest, the story is about a heavily pregnant Bidya err Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) who arrives in Kolkata looking for her husband who had arrived there on work and gone missing. Given the predicament, there is enough scope for drama. But, more interestingly, there is an undercurrent of an espionage thriller. The pre-title sequence opens with a chemical attack in Kolkata Metro. Cut to two years later, Vidya arrives in town for her quest and approaches the city police. Rana, newbie cop (Parambrata Chatterjee) has a soft corner for her and accompanies her in her hunt. Vidya seems to hit a dead-end in her search as nobody seems to know her husband Arnab Bagchi. But as they dig deeper, they uncover darker secrets. Okay! The discussion about the film's story has to stop here. It's a suspense flick after all. So, knowing anything more can spoil your experience. In fact, one can describe 'Kahaani' as an interesting multi- layered package that is unwrapped slowly, one layer at a time. Although it can seem slightly lengthy at some point, carefully planned twists will keep you glued to the screen. Also, notice the attention to detail in every scene. Many have been raving about Vidya Balan's performance. Full marks to her! But, what holds 'Kahaani' together is writer-director Sujoy Ghosh's watertight screenplay. The film is much unlike the regular bollywood thrillers that rely on stylish European locations, slick stunts, fast cars and scantily-clad women. Truly commendable! Among other goodies is Parambrata Chatterjee's has acted well along with some powerful performances by Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan, Saswata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas with Indraneil Sengupta in a brief role. Vishal-Shekhar's music has nothing striking, but flows with the film. Camera-work and editing is also neat. Filmmakers exploring cities other than Mumbai is relatively a recent phenomenon. While Delhi-based flicks gave the audience respite from tiresome Mumbai-based stuff, Kolkata is an interesting choice. The director effectively portrays the city's warmth, comfortable in its own time-warp while also providing the perfect setting for a thriller. Set around the time of Durga Puja, the film showcases the city's culture too. My advice: don't Google or ask-a-friend to know what the suspense is. Go to your nearest screen and catch the movie.

8.0,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Sujoy Ghosh's Triumphant Attempt at Bringing the Enchanting City of Calcutta to Life,"Kahaani is a 2012 Hindi Feature Film directed and co-written by Indian movie maker Sujoy Ghosh. By striking a delicate balance between the elements of Comedy and Tragedy—the two masks that define the Drama genre —Kahaani serves to be a quintessential Drama while simultaneously succeeding in walking the tightrope of Mystery and Suspense. Kahaani depicts the fascinating tale of a London-based IT Professional, Vidya Venkatesan-Bagchi (masterfully portrayed by Vidya Balan), in desperate pursuit of her spouse who has gone missing in the bewitching city of Calcutta (now Kolkata). In a heavily pregnant state, Vidya Bagchi arrives in Calcutta to pursue the search of her husband Arnab Bagchi—a Firewall expert who has mysteriously disappeared in his native city of Calcutta. Right from the moment Vidya Bagchi sets foot in Calcutta, a miasma of doubt and denial seems to occlude her strenuous pursuit. The apparent sympathy of the local police seems to betray simultaneously a sense of helplessness and sneer that further aggravates the torment of her abject solitude. Incapacitated by her lack of wherewithal and the fatigue of pregnancy, Vidya desperately roams about the city of Calcutta where she is greeted by the ugly realities of an ancient underworld waiting to unleash its fury. Amidst the city's perpetual hullabaloo, Vidya's only hope lies with Inspector Satyoki 'Rana' Sinha (subtly portrayed by Parambrata Chatterjee)—a local cop with a pleasing demeanor and innocent disposition. The natural affinity between Vidya and Rana soon develops into mutual bonding of trust, respect and affection as the two delve deep into the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Arnab Bagchi. Kahaani's ostensibly straightforward plot has its fair share of intricacies that keeps the viewer interested until the movie's jaw- dropping climax. With Kahaani, Vidya Balan adds yet another feather to her acting cap. Riding high on her tour de force in The Dirty Picture (2011), Balan packs yet another punch with a powerful portrayal of a bemused, pregnant woman in pursuit of her missing husband. Balan, in a bid to make up for her delayed entry into the Hindi Film Industry, seems to go from strength to strength making most of the purple patch that she has been enjoying since the success of Amitabh Bachchan starrer Paa, back in 2009. In a short career spanning just over six years, Balan has incredibly managed to conjure up a handful of larger than life portrayals: be it her chilling portrayal in Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007) or her earthy portrayal in Ishqiya (2010). What makes Vidya Balan unique is her great ability to get into the skin of the characters. In an industry stricken by glamor, Vidya dauntlessly seems to tread a path of her own that's richly paying its dividend. In the process, Balan has undoubtedly succeeded in getting her name registered in an elite club of performance-driven actresses who, over the years, have done Indian Cinema proud. In Kahaani, Sujoy Ghosh seems to have settled for a trade off between his creative aspirations and commercial compulsions. Kahaani's multi- layered plot presents a nice blend of Drama and Suspense with undercurrents of Noir. The presence of an extremely peculiar serial killer considerably spices up Kahaani's plot and adds immensely to its entertainment value. In contrast to depicting the classic caricature of a damsel in distress, Kahaani beautifully propagates the complex caricature of the beguiling city of Calcutta. Like any developed city of the world, Calcutta too seems overwhelmed by lies and liars, and ironically the only refuge seems to exist at the very epicenter of chaos. Satyajit Pande's topnotch cinematography adds great detail to the movie at different levels, and is well complemented by Vishal - Shekhar's background music. The word 'Kahaani' translates to 'A Story' in English, and Ghosh does full justice to its meaning by offering a masterclass in storytelling and managing a nice assemblage of Stage and Television actors who give memorable performances in Kahaani with special mention of Sasawata Chatterjee as Bob Biswas and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.as A. Khan. Ghosh and his dedicated team remarkably triumph in their daunting attempt to bring the enchanting city of Calcutta to life as Woody Allen had managed with the City of Love in Midnight in Paris last year. Overall, Kahaani is a wonderful cinematic experience that certainly goes beyond the realm of entertainment. However, despite the brilliant execution the movie faces occasional slip-ups owing to some forced incorporation of gimmicks and misdirection at certain points in the plot. From the Box Office point of view, the success of Kahaani is a great testament to the fact that a movie can flourish even in the absence of aggressive marketing and promotion as long as its high on quality and has an element of uniqueness about it. Kahaani also marks the beginning of a new era in Indian Cinema where filmmakers are intelligent enough to take into account the commercial considerations and practical limitations pertaining to movie-making, but not at the expense of creative liberty. 8/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",potpourri vestiges review sujoy ghoshs triumphant attempt at bringing enchanting city calcutta life,kahaani is 2012 hindi feature film directed co written by indian movie maker sujoy ghosh by striking delicate balance between elements comedy tragedy two masks that define drama genre kahaani serves be quintessential drama while simultaneously succeeding walking tightrope mystery suspense kahaani depicts fascinating tale london based it professional vidya venkatesan bagchi masterfully portrayed by vidya balan desperate pursuit her spouse who has gone missing bewitching city calcutta now kolkata heavily pregnant state vidya bagchi arrives calcutta pursue search her husband arnab bagchi firewall expert who has mysteriously disappeared his native city calcutta right moment vidya bagchi sets foot calcutta miasma doubt denial seems occlude her strenuous pursuit apparent sympathy local police seems betray simultaneously sense helplessness sneer that further aggravates torment her abject solitude incapacitated by her lack wherewithal fatigue pregnancy vidya desperately roams about city calcutta where she is greeted by ugly realities ancient underworld waiting unleash its fury amidst citys perpetual hullabaloo vidyas only hope lies with inspector satyoki rana sinha subtly portrayed by parambrata chatterjee local cop with pleasing demeanor innocent disposition natural affinity between vidya rana soon develops into mutual bonding trust respect affection as two delve deep into mystery surrounding disappearance arnab bagchi kahaanis ostensibly straightforward plot has its fair share intricacies that keeps viewer interested until movies jaw dropping climax with kahaani vidya balan adds yet another feather her acting cap riding high her tour de force dirty picture 2011 balan packs yet another punch with powerful portrayal bemused pregnant woman pursuit her missing husband balan bid make up her delayed entry into hindi film industry seems go strength strength making most purple patch that she has been enjoying since success amitabh bachchan starrer paa back 2009 short career spanning just over six years balan has incredibly managed conjure up handful larger than life portrayals be it her chilling portrayal bhool bhulaiyaa 2007 or her earthy portrayal ishqiya 2010 what makes vidya balan unique is her great ability get into skin characters industry stricken by glamor vidya dauntlessly seems tread path her own thats richly paying its dividend process balan has undoubtedly succeeded getting her name registered elite club performance driven actresses who over years have done indian cinema proud kahaani sujoy ghosh seems have settled trade off between his creative aspirations commercial compulsions kahaanis multi layered plot presents nice blend drama suspense with undercurrents noir presence extremely peculiar serial killer considerably spices up kahaanis plot adds immensely its entertainment value contrast depicting classic caricature damsel distress kahaani beautifully propagates complex caricature beguiling city calcutta like any developed city world calcutta too seems overwhelmed by lies liars ironically only refuge seems exist at very epicenter chaos satyajit pandes topnotch cinematography adds great detail movie at different levels is well complemented by vishal shekhars background music word kahaani translates story english ghosh does full justice its meaning by offering masterclass storytelling managing nice assemblage stage television actors who give memorable performances kahaani with special mention sasawata chatterjee as bob biswas nawazuddin siddiqui as khan ghosh his dedicated team remarkably triumph their daunting attempt bring enchanting city calcutta life as woody allen had managed with city love midnight paris last year overall kahaani is wonderful cinematic experience that certainly goes beyond realm entertainment however despite brilliant execution movie faces occasional slip ups owing some forced incorporation gimmicks misdirection at certain points plot box office point view success kahaani is great testament fact that movie can flourish even absence aggressive marketing promotion as long as its high quality has element uniqueness about it kahaani also marks beginning new era indian cinema where filmmakers are intelligent enough take into account commercial considerations practical limitations pertaining movie making but not at expense creative liberty 8 10,0.5758080808080808,0.21565824056895483,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,KAHAANI: If 'story' is what you are looking for .... you have knocked on the right door,"For the lovers of story.. no item songs, no style statements and no annoying humor, Bollywood welcomes you with this 'Kahaani'. The movie lives up to its name for more than you could have asked for.The story starts with a pregnant Vidya Balan as Mrs Vidya or Bida Bakshi who comes from London to Kolkata to search her missing husband. There he meets Parambrata who helps her with her case. Her husband, 'Arnab Bakshi' works at National Data Center( NDC). NDC, hotel where he stayed, his uncle, no one has heard of a name 'Arnab Bakshi' and Vidya continues to insist her point . The first clue takes them to Mrs Agnes who is the HR of NDC. She tells them of some 'Milan Damji' who looks like Arnab. A series of phone calls and next we know Agnes is dead. In comes Mr Khan, some police head from Delhi. He is trying to protect the identity of 'Milan Damji' and we get the hint of he being the bad guy. At intermission, you know you have a winner at hand and the plot keeps you intrigued .Then, as the story proceeds to clues one after another, all of them die in the hands of a contract killer 'Bob'. They finally come to know of Shridhar who is the chief of NDC, who kept visiting 'Milan' and before Khan comes to the rescue of Vidya & Rana from Shridhar, Vidya kills him. This is where we get the first twist in the tale.. Khan & Rana were using Vidya to find a terrorist named 'Milan Damji' who was responsible for train attacks in Kolkata. If you think this is it, then hold on till the story unfolds. Any more revelations beyond this point would not do justice to this kahaani.Bob as the contract killer is brilliant. Nawazzudin as Mr Khan is rock solid. Parambrata as Rana supports Vidya to the core and yet again Vidya Balan delivers a stellar performance proving why she is amongst the best actresses we have. Director & Story writer Sujoy Ghosh brings to us a rare 130 minutes 'kahaani' that relives the genre of thriller movies in Bollywood.This one's for the win.

8.0,Storytelling at its best...,"A young woman, large with child, her jaw set resolutely, heads out of the airport and into the bedlam that is present-day Calcutta. As droves of taxi drivers close in on her, clamoring for her custom, Usha Uthup, Calcutta's most famous singer, snarls Aami Shotti Bolchi –I tell you the truth—on the soundtrack. The artful dissonance of that jazzy track highlights the paradox of Calcutta, India's most populous city, at once erudite and ill-bred. The mayhem is heightened as the city prepares for the ten-day festival of Durga Puja, Calcutta's biggest celebration. The young woman, Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan), directs the cabbie to a police station, where she files a missing persons report. She has flown in from London on the trail of her husband Arnab who had come to Calcutta on a two-week consulting job and inexplicably vanished. They are both computer engineers—firewall specialists, a detail lost on the obtuse official taking down her report.Where would one even begin to look for a missing person in a city of teeming millions? One immediately sympathizes with the woman and the apparent impossibility of the task she has set herself. But we underestimate her mettle: she isn't cowed by bullying men who would have her accept her husband has left her pregnant and flown the coop; or by the Byzantine bureaucracy that accompanies the simplest government transactions; or the impenetrability of a city whose geography, language, culture, and nuances are completely alien to her.With intelligence, charm, and sheer doggedness, she works at unraveling the mystery of what might have befallen her husband. She gains unexpected allies in a young policeman Rana (well-regarded Bengali actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay in his Hindi debut), a couple of urchins who work as chai-wallahs and errand runners, and Agnes D'Mello, the kindly HR Manager of the company which might have enlisted her husband's services. Within days, she convinces everyone that she isn't budging from the city without answers.Her tenacity uncovers unsettling facts while yielding no satisfying answer about Arnab's whereabouts. As a contract killer starts shadowing her, we realize she is unwittingly on to something much bigger than the temporary disappearance of her husband. Sujoy Ghosh made his directing debut in 2003 with the sweetly gentle ""Jhankar Beats"", followed it up with two duds, and emerges a masterful storyteller with ""Kahaani"". The writing is the star here (Ghosh collaborated on the story, screenplay, and dialogue) –there isn't a single throwaway scene in the film. In this ingeniously constructed thriller, even the smallest details have significance, adding up to a hugely satisfying whole.Vidya Balan, who is incapable of doing wrong these days, is the soul of the film. Her Vidya Bagchi is an unlikely protagonist for a mystery. Who would have thought a hugely pregnant woman scouring a city for her missing husband would make a compelling heroine? Going against the most primal female urge to find a safe haven to give birth, she instead thrusts herself into increasingly dangerous situations in her quest for the truth. She inspires compassion and admiration, as in the sweltering heat and chaos of Calcutta, she tours its morgues, hospitals, police stations, and seedy guest houses for elusive clues. Indeed, Calcutta is a character in the film: alternately stately, raucous, playful, boorish, scary, and secretive—maddeningly tantalizing and stubbornly unwilling to reveal what happened to Arnab, and Ghosh and his cinematographer Satyajit ""Setu"" Pande use the city's myriad faces to telling effect. There is nothing showy or actorly in Vidya's performance: she creates a completely realistic character who—even in advanced pregnancy—will not be placated or intimidated away from her mission. Her forthright, no-nonsense manner is reserved for the world outside, but we witness her moments of anxiety, fear, doubt, and sorrow in the privacy of her hotel room.The film's conclusion falls fittingly on the final day of Durga Puja, the festival that celebrates the slaying of the demon Mahishasur at the hands of the fearsome goddess Durga. When everyone else is either ineffectual or untrustworthy, must Vidya Bagchi assume the modern-day avatar of an avenging goddess, too? It would be a disservice to the best thriller since ""A Wednesday"" to reveal any details – in fact, I entreat you not to discuss ""Kahaani"" with anyone who hasn't seen the film.Everything in this film works because it is so superbly and tightly written. The supporting performances are excellent, with Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the cynical Intelligence Bureau officer Khan, Parambrata Chattopadhyay, and Saswata Chatterjee deserving special mention. In flashbacks narrated by Vidya, we see Indraneil Sengupta as her husband Arnab, while Darshan Jariwala makes a dignified appearance as Khan's superior who took early retirement. The two tea-seller boys are unaffected naturals, as they open up to the woman who treats them with kindness and dignity.Over the end credits of this fine film, Amitabh Bachchan sings a poem by the most famous Bengali of all—Rabindranath Tagore: Ekla Chalo Re –be not afraid to walk alone—which might be a poignant anthem for our spirited heroine.",storytelling at its best,young woman large with child her jaw set resolutely heads out airport into bedlam that is present day calcutta as droves taxi drivers close her clamoring her custom usha uthup calcuttas most famous singer snarls aami shotti bolchi i tell you truth soundtrack artful dissonance that jazzy track highlights paradox calcutta indias most populous city at once erudite ill bred mayhem is heightened as city prepares ten day festival durga puja calcuttas biggest celebration young woman vidya bagchi vidya balan directs cabbie police station where she files missing persons report she has flown london trail her husband arnab who had come calcutta two week consulting job inexplicably vanished they are both computer engineers firewall specialists detail lost obtuse official taking down her report where would one even begin look missing person city teeming millions one immediately sympathizes with woman apparent impossibility task she has set herself but we underestimate her mettle she isnt cowed by bullying men who would have her accept her husband has left her pregnant flown coop or by byzantine bureaucracy that accompanies simplest government transactions or impenetrability city whose geography language culture nuances are completely alien her with intelligence charm sheer doggedness she works at unraveling mystery what might have befallen her husband she gains unexpected allies young policeman rana well regarded bengali actor parambrata chattopadhyay his hindi debut couple urchins who work as chai wallahs errand runners agnes dmello kindly hr manager company which might have enlisted her husbands services within days she convinces everyone that she isnt budging city without answers her tenacity uncovers unsettling facts while yielding no satisfying answer about arnabs whereabouts as contract killer starts shadowing her we realize she is unwittingly something much bigger than temporary disappearance her husband sujoy ghosh made his directing debut 2003 with sweetly gentle jhankar beats followed it up with two duds emerges masterful storyteller with kahaani writing is star here ghosh collaborated story screenplay dialogue there isnt single throwaway scene film this ingeniously constructed thriller even smallest details have significance adding up hugely satisfying whole vidya balan who is incapable doing wrong these days is soul film her vidya bagchi is unlikely protagonist mystery who would have thought hugely pregnant woman scouring city her missing husband would make compelling heroine going against most primal female urge find safe haven give birth she instead thrusts herself into increasingly dangerous situations her quest truth she inspires compassion admiration as sweltering heat chaos calcutta she tours its morgues hospitals police stations seedy guest houses elusive clues indeed calcutta is character film alternately stately raucous playful boorish scary secretive maddeningly tantalizing stubbornly unwilling reveal what happened arnab ghosh his cinematographer satyajit setu pande use citys myriad faces telling effect there is nothing showy or actorly vidyas performance she creates completely realistic character who even advanced pregnancy will not be placated or intimidated away her mission her forthright no nonsense manner is reserved world outside but we witness her moments anxiety fear doubt sorrow privacy her hotel room films conclusion falls fittingly final day durga puja festival that celebrates slaying demon mahishasur at hands fearsome goddess durga when everyone else is either ineffectual or untrustworthy must vidya bagchi assume modern day avatar avenging goddess too it would be disservice best thriller since wednesday reveal any details fact i entreat you not discuss kahaani with anyone who hasnt seen film everything this film works because it is so superbly tightly written supporting performances are excellent with nawazuddin siddiqui as cynical intelligence bureau officer khan parambrata chattopadhyay saswata chatterjee deserving special mention flashbacks narrated by vidya we see indraneil sengupta as her husband arnab while darshan jariwala makes dignified appearance as khans superior who took early retirement two tea seller boys are unaffected naturals as they open up woman who treats them with kindness dignity over end credits this fine film amitabh bachchan sings poem by most famous bengali all rabindranath tagore ekla chalo re be not afraid walk alone which might be poignant anthem our spirited heroine,0.5483164983164983,0.13736171236171238,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
6.0,twists,"Poison gas is accidentally released on a train in Kolkata, India. It is declared a terrorist attack and the case remains unsolved. Two years later, a very pregnant Vidya Bagchi from London arrives to search for her missing husband Arnab Bagchi. Police officer Rana helps her on her search but they keep running into dead ends. At Arnab's work, she finds evidence of a doppelganger in missing employee Milan Damji. The search triggers assassinations and more road blocks.This movie has a solid Frantic start except it's inferior in various aspects. I do love a pregnant woman as the lead and Vidya is a very compelling actress. The story showed too many of its cards too soon. At least, that's what I thought at the time. The convoluted story moves quickly enough that the logic of the situation can't be examined. With the final twist ending, it's obvious that this is like a magic trick where the magician is turning over his playing cards to distract and misdirect. It's all a trick. Everything that didn't seem right is overshadowed by the final twist.Many have compared the ending to The Usual Suspects. For sure, I didn't see it coming. One must remember that TUS is a tale told by the unreliable narrator. So any inconsistencies are simply lies. In fact, the twist is that it may as well be all lies. That's not the case here. It's hard to separate possible logic holes with the characters' misdirection. For example, I noticed the strange wiping down by Vidya which made no sense at the time. Of course, the twist explains the wiping down but upon more careful reflection, it becomes questionable again. Essentially, that's how I feel about the whole movie. I keep wondering if the characters' actions actually make sense. If the point is for a pregnant woman to be overlooked as she does the search, does it make sense to have a police officer be her partner everywhere. That's the opposite of the original intent. If one doesn't dig too deeply, this all makes sense but I don't know if it can withstand some real digging.",twists,poison gas is accidentally released train kolkata india it is declared terrorist attack case remains unsolved two years later very pregnant vidya bagchi london arrives search her missing husband arnab bagchi police officer rana helps her her search but they keep running into dead ends at arnabs work she finds evidence doppelganger missing employee milan damji search triggers assassinations more road blocks this movie has solid frantic start except its inferior various aspects i do love pregnant woman as lead vidya is very compelling actress story showed too many its cards too soon at least thats what i thought at time convoluted story moves quickly enough that logic situation cant be examined with final twist ending its obvious that this is like magic trick where magician is turning over his playing cards distract misdirect its all trick everything that didnt seem right is overshadowed by final twist many have compared ending usual suspects sure i didnt see it coming one must remember that tus is tale told by unreliable narrator so any inconsistencies are simply lies fact twist is that it may as well be all lies thats not case here its hard separate possible logic holes with characters misdirection example i noticed strange wiping down by vidya which made no sense at time course twist explains wiping down but upon more careful reflection it becomes questionable again essentially thats how i feel about whole movie i keep wondering if characters actions actually make sense if point is pregnant woman be overlooked as she does search does it make sense have police officer be her partner everywhere thats opposite original intent if one doesnt dig too deeply this all makes sense but i dont know if it can withstand some real digging,0.477029761904762,0.08869841269841272,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,This is NOT your typical sort of Bollywood film!,"If you are looking for a typical sort of Bollywood film where you have a romance and LOTS of singing, then ""Kahaani"" is not for you. While I like the former sort of film, here in the States MOST Indian films we get are like that and so it's nice to have something very different--and ""Kahaani"" is very different.Vidya Balan plays a woman named Vidya. She's lived in London and although she speaks Hindi, she is very westernized. So, when her husband, Arnab, disappears, she is not like a typical Indian woman--she goes looking for him--even if it means leaving her London home when she is obviously VERY pregnant (heck, she looks like she's ready to explode during the film!). However, when she arrives in Kolkata, she finds no evidence that Arnab ever went there on a business trip. The police assist her but they also come up with nothing. However, the woman in human resources where Arnab claimed to be working thinks that perhaps Arnab is a DIFFERENT employee--a guy name Milan that worked there two years ago. Unfortunately for the H.R. woman, this ends up costing her her life! Obviously something very bad and very dangerous is afoot. To discover exactly what and who's behind it, watch ""Kahaani"". I could tell you more--as the film really packs a lot into only two hours--but it also would impact your enjoyment and give away way too much. Just see the film.There really isn't much to complain about in this film. The writing is VERY original but more importantly, it's very INTELLIGENTLY written and is made for an audience who doesn't mind a complex plot or strong female lead--especially for an Indian film. I also LOVED the balding assassin--he was so scary because he seemed so incredibly ordinary! All in all, a great film--one of the best I've seen from India and comparable to the best stuff made anywhere.",this is not your typical sort bollywood film,if you are looking typical sort bollywood film where you have romance lots singing then kahaani is not you while i like former sort film here states most indian films we get are like that so its nice have something very different kahaani is very different vidya balan plays woman named vidya shes lived london although she speaks hindi she is very westernized so when her husband arnab disappears she is not like typical indian woman she goes looking him even if it means leaving her london home when she is obviously very pregnant heck she looks like shes ready explode during film however when she arrives kolkata she finds no evidence that arnab ever went there business trip police assist her but they also come up with nothing however woman human resources where arnab claimed be working thinks that perhaps arnab is different employee guy name milan that worked there two years ago unfortunately h r woman this ends up costing her her life obviously something very bad very dangerous is afoot discover exactly what whos behind it watch kahaani i could tell you more as film really packs lot into only two hours but it also would impact your enjoyment give away way too much just see film there really isnt much complain about this film writing is very original but more importantly its very intelligently written is made audience who doesnt mind complex plot or strong female lead especially indian film i also loved balding assassin he was so scary because he seemed so incredibly ordinary all all great film one best ive seen india comparable best stuff made anywhere,0.5833760683760684,0.14523504273504273,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,One of the best!,"One of the finest thrillers I have seen in Bollywood. In fact after A Wednesday this is the best thriller in Bollywood. Among all senseless movies, such movies reinstate faith in Hindi cinema. Excellent effort by the director in both scrip and casting.The movie starts with a terrorist trying out a gas attack on rats and when thats successful he tries it out with humans on the metro. Then the story shifts to a couple of years later. Here a heavily pregnant Vidya arrives in kolkata to search for her missing husband. All she has left with her is only a photograph of him. She directly goes to the police station from the airport and here she meets rana who instantly develops a liking for her. She lodges a complaint and the inspector of the station is also impressed as she fixes the new software in the station computers.Now with the help of rana she begins the search for her husband with the minimal number of clues she has got. As she proceeds in her search she learns that her husband resembles a former employee in a certain company ndc. When these developments take place she unknowingly shakes up an old case with the Intelligence bureau and the second in command A.Khan enters. He is no nonsense cop whose mission is not clear in the beginning. At the same time, few people feel the heat that that triggers few killings by the normal and not so harmful looking contract killer bob. The first half finishes with the last scene being bob trying to kill vidya.A.Khan then reveals to vidya that the former employee with whom her husbands face recemble is the dreaded terrorist who killed 100 people in the kolkata metro. and he also reveals that the terrorist was a former government agent who turned into a terrorist there is a mole in the ndc and ib who are directly helping the terrorist get away. The rest of the story revolves around how Vidya connects all the dots and help the police. And does she find her husband forms the rest of the story.The movie has a lot of nail biting scenes. The bgm is a main ingredient as it adds to the suspense immensely. The director should be praised for preparing such a tight script. And as far as the casting, he has just got the right people for the right role.The movie has been released just after Vidya Balan got the national award and this movie might get her another one. The woman almost singlehandedly has carries out this movie on her shoulders. She is just almost ruling the male dominated industry with her moves like nokj, dirty picture and the latest one kahaani.",one best,one finest thrillers i have seen bollywood fact after wednesday this is best thriller bollywood among all senseless movies such movies reinstate faith hindi cinema excellent effort by director both scrip casting movie starts with terrorist trying out gas attack rats when thats successful he tries it out with humans metro then story shifts couple years later here heavily pregnant vidya arrives kolkata search her missing husband all she has left with her is only photograph him she directly goes police station airport here she meets rana who instantly develops liking her she lodges complaint inspector station is also impressed as she fixes new software station computers now with help rana she begins search her husband with minimal number clues she has got as she proceeds her search she learns that her husband resembles former employee certain company ndc when these developments take place she unknowingly shakes up old case with intelligence bureau second command khan enters he is no nonsense cop whose mission is not clear beginning at same time few people feel heat that that triggers few killings by normal not so harmful looking contract killer bob first half finishes with last scene being bob trying kill vidya khan then reveals vidya that former employee with whom her husbands face recemble is dreaded terrorist who killed 100 people kolkata metro he also reveals that terrorist was former government agent who turned into terrorist there is mole ndc ib who are directly helping terrorist get away rest story revolves around how vidya connects all dots help police does she find her husband forms rest story movie has lot nail biting scenes bgm is main ingredient as it adds suspense immensely director should be praised preparing such tight script as far as casting he has just got right people right role movie has been released just after vidya balan got national award this movie might get her another one woman almost singlehandedly has carries out this movie her shoulders she is just almost ruling male dominated industry with her moves like nokj dirty picture latest one kahaani,0.4048399275143461,0.12039162387999598,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.38}"
