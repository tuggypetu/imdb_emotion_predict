8.0,Never thought it was horrible. Still don't.,"I remember in 2002 when I went to go see this movie just to laugh at it. It's honestly not funny.

Of course hindsight is 20/20 and it's now 2018 and we know this was written by Shonda rhimes, so it HAD to be messed up, right? It's been 16 years.

7.0,"Oh, get over yourself and admit that this is a cute movie","Out of all the people, I admit that I bash Britney Spears all the time. But I saw this movie because my 2 best friends and my boyfriend wanted to see this. And we actually thought this was a cute movie. And it's funny, our friendship is like the one in this movie. There's the sexy one, there's the smart one, there's the one who wants to make it big, and of course my boyfriend. Of course it's not oscar worthy, or the movie of the year. But it's cute. Kind of cheesy, but fun. So what if you're not a Britney Spears fan, if you hate this movie just because someone you don't like is in it, you have to be a pretty shallow person. So stop acting like you know everything about movies. I'm not a pre-teen, but I liked it. So like I said, just admit that it was cute. Like people are going to contact you and praise you for making fun of this movie.7/10",oh get over yourself admit that this is cute movie,out all people i admit that i bash britney spears all time but i saw this movie because my 2 best friends my boyfriend wanted see this we actually thought this was cute movie its funny our friendship is like one this movie theres sexy one theres smart one theres one who wants make it big course my boyfriend course its not oscar worthy or movie year but its cute kind cheesy but fun so what if youre not britney spears fan if you hate this movie just because someone you dont like is it you have be pretty shallow person so stop acting like you know everything about movies im not pre teen but i liked it so like i said just admit that it was cute like people are going contact you praise you making fun this movie 7 10,0.6246753246753246,0.2233766233766234,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.36, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.08}"
,"For what it is, a teen road movie, not as bad as many are claiming.","I read all the reviews and comments before seeing ""Crossroads."" Since I got it free from the public library, and ""time"" was my only investment, I'm not sorry at all. Roughly 50% of IMDb votes are ""1"" which is totally absurd. A more accurate rating is probably in the 4 to 6 range, compared to all similar films. ""Center Stage"", where the central characters are dancers training to make it big in ballet, is a similar film.Other commentors say ""Britney Spears can't sing."" Those comments are equally absurd. While I'm not particularly a fan of hers, she indeed can sing, very well. As a singer she is as good as most of the rest of the young singers who cater to the teeniebopper audience. She certainly is a better singer than Madonna who achieved her fame on image alone.Can Britney act? Compared to good young actresses, Britney is fairly amateurish. But she didn't have to stretch very far for the role of a proper, studious high school valedictorian who decided to look for her mother who abandoned her as a baby to be raised by her single father (Ackroyd). And, along the way write poetry which was then put to music by a young man who drove the three girls west to Los Angeles.Most of the situations and dialog are silly, and there are many close-range shots of a pretty, smiling Britney. However I suspect they would appeal to the under-15 crowd of Britney fans. I enjoyed the film from the point of view that it gave me some glimpse of the real Britney, one that is not revealed in her concerts and music videos. I believe, as she grows up and out of her former image, she will develop a more mature singing and acting style and will continue her popularity for a long time. (Year 2005 update: I was wrong, she's become very strange! Year 2007 update: She has gotten even more strange! Year 2008 update: Even her little sister has become strange, and a new mother!!))Critic Ebert gives an accurate review of the facts in the case, I will not repeat them here. While I probably would not recommend this film to anyone, I personally enjoyed watching it. Not a very good film, still it also is not a bad film.

6.0,"I cannot say 'Crossroads' is a great movie, but it definitely does not deserve 3.5","There are some weaknesses. No, MANY weaknesses. However, the movie has some good quality as well. First, this movie is for Britney and Britney(album). In early 2000s, Britney Spears can have and deserves promotional 'movie'. Three songs in Britney's third album 'Britney' are featured in the movie. Also, supporting roles are trying so hard for Lucy to tell her story that they look like tools not actors. For example, when Kit and Mimi leave the place to make a room for Lucy and Ben's romance to bloom, their excuses are awfully unrealistic. Second, the storyline is very simple and linear just like their road trip. But, doesn't all teen or coming-of-age movies have simple storyline? Lastly, the chemistry between Lucy & Ben and Lucy & friends make up for somewhat tedious story. Some say Britney was a bad actor, but that's because she acts 'this 'naïve, innocent, and nerdy virgin who writes poems' which is the very opposite of a shiny, cute pop star who she actually is. Audience also had prejudice on Britney Spears before coming to the theater. Three girls seem to have genuine connection and to really care for one another on the screen. 'Crossroads' and Britney Spears do not deserve this much ridicule.",i cannot say crossroads is great movie but it definitely does not deserve 3 5,there are some weaknesses no many weaknesses however movie has some good quality as well first this movie is britney britney album early 2000s britney spears can have deserves promotional movie three songs britneys third album britney are featured movie also supporting roles are trying so hard lucy tell her story that they look like tools not actors example when kit mimi leave place make room lucy bens romance bloom their excuses are awfully unrealistic second storyline is very simple linear just like their road trip but doesnt all teen or coming age movies have simple storyline lastly chemistry between lucy ben lucy friends make up somewhat tedious story some say britney was bad actor but thats because she acts this na ve innocent nerdy virgin who writes poems which is very opposite shiny cute pop star who she actually is audience also had prejudice britney spears before coming theater three girls seem have genuine connection really care one another screen crossroads britney spears do not deserve this much ridicule,0.417906746031746,0.06909722222222223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.22}"
5.0,"Com'on, it's not that bad.","Once upon a time, Lucy (Britney Spears), Kit (Zoe Saldana), and Mimi (Taryn Manning) were best friends. They buried a box of their dreams and vowed to dig it up on their senior prom night. They have drifted apart over the years. Lucy is a bookworm valedictorian who pines for her absent mother and to be a normal teenager. Kit is the popular mean girl. She's planning to marry her high school boyfriend but he has been distant ever since going off to college. Mimi is pregnant desperate to audition for a record company in L.A. Lucy and Kit have a disappointing prom and join Mimi in digging up the box. They both have a mission and follow Mimi on her road trip in Ben (Anson Mount)'s car.Com'on, it's not that bad. Is it? Everybody trashes this for Spears. She doesn't fit the nerdy brains role. They could have at least given her a pair of glasses. She couldn't wait to get into a belly shirt. She's not that good as an actress but she's able to walk and talk. She does have good acting partners and I like the girls' frail friendship. Ben is an unnecessary extra and sometimes he sticks out.

3.0,Great horrible movie!,"I love Crossroads because it's so terrible. Definitely one of the best ""worst movies"" I've ever seen, it tells the story of how Britney Spears looks like a fashion model and acts like an angel while still managing to be the most unpopular girl at school. Sob, sob! Incredibly awful and idiotic drama coupled with sickeningly sweet romance make this one a not-to-be-missed...if you're the sort to love MST3K, that is. Sure, Britney can't act too well, but she can sing, and this movie is actually a LOT better than Glitter, Mariah Carey's similarly-themed vehicle.

4.0,"Forget about Britney, it is the script that ruins this movie!","This is a bad movie, mostly because of the simple reason that it's an absolutely horrible written one.This movie is mostly infamous and hated because of Britney Spears, who plays the lead role. But really, in all honesty, she is far from the worse thing about this movie. It's true that she is obviously no actress but I didn't exactly hated her watching in this and her performance didn't made me cringe all that badly.It's a movie that got made at the prime of her musical career, when she also was still considered to be fresh and innocent. But it does not at all feel like this movie got specifically written for her. She plays a character that is quite different from herself and in the movie she doesn't even sing or dances all that much, which is good news for a lot of people. It's true that this movie is a typical chick-flick, so perhaps I'm not the right person to judge it but I'm still sure that I'm very well able to recognize a good movie when I see it and this movie just isn't much good to watch. The entire way the movie got written and progresses is not only boring and pointless but also lazy and too often doesn't make enough sense.I just don't get some of the stuff that this movie does. Britney Spears is supposed to be an ugly girl, that gets laughed at, at school, which is laughable in itself. No matter how much you just don't like Britney, you can't really call her ugly, especially not when you also see her body as well, which she shows quite a lot in this movie actually. And for some crazy and never explained reason, 3 girls who used to be best friends stopped being friends at high school and even somewhat hate each other go on a road trip together and for some, totally different, crazy reason they also suddenly are friends again, as if everything that was shown and told in the movie previously wasn't important and had even never happened.Something I also really don't understand; the Britney Spears character had a nerdy boyfriend (played by Justin Long of course) for 3 years but as the movie goes along she totally forgets about this and so are its viewers supposed to do I suppose? Since she hooks up with a totally different guy, which is something we also are supposed to cheer for. But what about poor Justin Long Brit? What did he ever do wrong to you. It just didn't feel right but it's normal for this movie to leave many loose ends like this and character just keep on changing their behavior and personalities for no logical reasons, other than it's just being a very poorly written movie.The movie really doesn't progress very naturally or pleasantly and doesn't really wrap things up properly. Just think about it. The 3 main characters all go on the road trip for a specific reason but for none of them, it ends up the way they were hoping for. The movie acts as if it has an happy ending but once you really start thinking about it, you could wonder to yourself, what exactly is so happy about it.It's actually amazing to see how many big names appear in this movie. Granted, that most of them weren't really big names yet at the time, such as Zoe Saldana and Justin Long but still it makes you wonder how so many great actors ended up playing in this movie. It's probably all due to it that this was a Britney Spears vehicle and lots of people tried to ride in on the success and fame of her. But as it turned out, this is not exactly a project that any of the people involved with could be very proud of.Not exactly the worst movies of all time, not even close honestly but it still is far from a great or likable enough movie as well.4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",forget about britney it is script that ruins this movie,this is bad movie mostly because simple reason that its absolutely horrible written one this movie is mostly infamous hated because britney spears who plays lead role but really all honesty she is far worse thing about this movie its true that she is obviously no actress but i didnt exactly hated her watching this her performance didnt made me cringe all that badly its movie that got made at prime her musical career when she also was still considered be fresh innocent but it does not at all feel like this movie got specifically written her she plays character that is quite different herself movie she doesnt even sing or dances all that much which is good news lot people its true that this movie is typical chick flick so perhaps im not right person judge it but im still sure that im very well able recognize good movie when i see it this movie just isnt much good watch entire way movie got written progresses is not only boring pointless but also lazy too often doesnt make enough sense i just dont get some stuff that this movie does britney spears is supposed be ugly girl that gets laughed at at school which is laughable itself no matter how much you just dont like britney you cant really call her ugly especially not when you also see her body as well which she shows quite lot this movie actually some crazy never explained reason 3 girls who used be best friends stopped being friends at high school even somewhat hate each other go road trip together some totally different crazy reason they also suddenly are friends again as if everything that was shown told movie previously wasnt important had even never happened something i also really dont understand britney spears character had nerdy boyfriend played by justin long course 3 years but as movie goes along she totally forgets about this so are its viewers supposed do i suppose since she hooks up with totally different guy which is something we also are supposed cheer but what about poor justin long brit what did he ever do wrong you it just didnt feel right but its normal this movie leave many loose ends like this character just keep changing their behavior personalities no logical reasons other than its just being very poorly written movie movie really doesnt progress very naturally or pleasantly doesnt really wrap things up properly just think about it 3 main characters all go road trip specific reason but none them it ends up way they were hoping movie acts as if it has happy ending but once you really start thinking about it you could wonder yourself what exactly is so happy about it its actually amazing see how many big names appear this movie granted that most them werent really big names yet at time such as zoe saldana justin long but still it makes you wonder how so many great actors ended up playing this movie its probably all due it that this was britney spears vehicle lots people tried ride success fame her but as it turned out this is not exactly project that any people involved with could be very proud not exactly worst movies all time not even close honestly but it still is far great or likable enough movie as well 4 10,0.5681562881562882,0.06380426311277375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.34}"
4.0,"Caught between two things; being a proper, honest to goodness movie, or being a teenage sisterhood pamphlet...","For a while there, I thought that I was going to be in genuine danger of having to admit that I liked this movie. For the first forty minutes it was a warm, if slightly generic, road movie about the positives of friendship and following your dreams... Then, after that point, I started to feel it turn into a Steel Magnolias clone. It was now apparently the type of film where the girls all sit around in a sewing circle, and discuss their problems. I suppose this is fine if you feel like these are real issues and you can relate to them, but when they feel as though they've been cribbed from the pages of 'Dear Abby... ', you stop suspending your disbelief that these are real people, and start seeing them for what they are: Stock Movie Characters.Going along with the well-worn movie tradition, the guy our heroine gets with has to be 'hot', and not the slightly awkward, geeky schoolfriend that she actually shares a little bit of a rapport with. That's Movie Law - don't lose your virginity to someone you have a little bit of history with, lose it instead to the hunk you've only just met who has a heartbreaking backstory and abs chiseled from stone, but lacks the facility of meaningful conversation. Hey, why talk much when you can just beat up sleazy jerks in bars and win the girl's affection that way, right?!The first half of the film actually has a path that seems like it might be leading somewhere... until suddenly, that trail goes cold, and the rest of the movie is essentially just a visually 'inspirational' pep talk for Spears' status as a teen role model. It's a shame too, because Spears' performance as a whole suggests she would be capable of handling more diverse requirements.

3.0,"Crossroads: Business in the front, Party in the back...","To begin, because that is always a good starting point with films of this nature, I must take a step forward and say that the acting wasn't excruciating, but it was painful. It was obvious that our three leads, Spears, Saldana, and Manning, were quickly becoming strong friends  and that friendship translated well onto the screen, but it was their individual stories and accomplishments that created the pain. In one scene, we saw this trio as little girls  friends without a care in the world  then instantly we are pushed into the awkward high school dark ages where nobody is friends with anyone. Riffs have been issued, and we are asked to rediscover who these characters are again. Matching them with their young counterparts is easy, but when their mouths open, it is another world all together. Spears leads with a hodgepodge of different characteristics. She dances sensually in her bedroom, unrobes nonchalantly in front of her lab partner, but is most avid about doing the right thing when it comes to morality and truthfulness. There is even one scene where she hangs up on her father, no doubtably instilling the correct visions into her impressionable teen fan base. She couldn't give us a straight character to save her life. Coupled with the annoying Zoe Saldana who tries the hardest of the group, but cannot seem to quite understand the life surrounding her. Then, painful to write, there is Taryn Manning (who gets better with each film) using every cliché redneck white-trash persona possible to define her character. It isn't bad enough that we have Spears fading in and out of her ""real"" character that to have Manning use ""y'all"" like it is Shakespeare  yikes. Again, the acting isn't bad (I have seen far, far, far worse), but it isn't Juliard  closer to flunking out of Acting 101.I have mediocre respect for director Tamra Davis. The woman that gave us the hysterical and near cult-classic ""Billy Madison"" as well as ""Half-Baked"", has also turned out slow duds like ""Gun Crazy"" and, surprise, ""Crossroads"". Her talent seems to be all over the place instead of choosing projects that will continue to define her. Listening to the commentary, it felt she did this to 1) work with Spears, 2) she needed the rent money, and 3) it was an all girl cast  her youthfulness will be returned. Not exactly the typical reasons artist create on a blank slate. With Davis, I wanted humor, darkness, or anything that would make me remember why I loved ""Madison"" or ""Half-Baked'  ANYTHING  there was nothing. Did I expect it with ""Crossroads"", probably not, but it would have been nice to see something that was uniquely hers. Road movies are made weekly, and it is those road films that try to bring something new to the genre that stand out and bring more to the table. Wasn't ""Billy Madison"" just a take-off of ""Back to School""? I just question the ability of Davis without a studio baking and thankfully she has taken her raw, rotten talent to television only to further infuse the masses.We are left with nothing more than the story. What story did ""Crossroads"" tell? How about one lone girl's quest to find herself and loose her virginity? Does that sound right? Again, this wasn't rocket science writing, yet it seemed amateur from the first word. We know who Spears' love interest is going to be from the beginning, the ""take"" at the end is given away within the first twenty minutes, and the only strength to this entire film is a scene with Dan Aykroyd saying ""I was a Ghostbuster, a Blues Brother, and Conehead  I did this film for my kids"". I believe that sums up this whole story in a nutshell. Needless to say, the story lacked any depth, and there was one scene where we attempted to bring real life to the screen with a rape, an accidental death, and our old friend, ""underage drinking"". Thankfully, Spears could push beyond all this and finally sing her songs near the end, the obvious finale to the film that was started. The ending point didn't match with the starting point in this film.So, I watched this film. Everyone will have to at one point in their life, I just shortened the inevitable. Again, it wasn't the worst film ever made, ""Glitter"" still ranks below this, but there wasn't any value in the final performance. Spears didn't push for this film to be made because she wanted to be an actress, she wanted more face time with an audience that seemed on the fence about her ability  and as time has shown, we didn't make the best assumption. The acting wasn't horrible, but everything else was so we are left with a sour taste in our mouth coming from all directions. I will not, nor suggest this film to anyone except my wife, who thought it was better than ""Clerks II"".Ouch. I will end on that note.Grade: ** out of *****",crossroads business front party back,begin because that is always good starting point with films this nature i must take step forward say that acting wasnt excruciating but it was painful it was obvious that our three leads spears saldana manning were quickly becoming strong friends that friendship translated well onto screen but it was their individual stories accomplishments that created pain one scene we saw this trio as little girls friends without care world then instantly we are pushed into awkward high school dark ages where nobody is friends with anyone riffs have been issued we are asked rediscover who these characters are again matching them with their young counterparts is easy but when their mouths open it is another world all together spears leads with hodgepodge different characteristics she dances sensually her bedroom unrobes nonchalantly front her lab partner but is most avid about doing right thing when it comes morality truthfulness there is even one scene where she hangs up her father no doubtably instilling correct visions into her impressionable teen fan base she couldnt give us straight character save her life coupled with annoying zoe saldana who tries hardest group but cannot seem quite understand life surrounding her then painful write there is taryn manning who gets better with each film using every clich redneck white trash persona possible define her character it isnt bad enough that we have spears fading out her real character that have manning use yall like it is shakespeare yikes again acting isnt bad i have seen far far far worse but it isnt juliard closer flunking out acting 101 i have mediocre respect director tamra davis woman that gave us hysterical near cult classic billy madison as well as half baked has also turned out slow duds like gun crazy surprise crossroads her talent seems be all over place instead choosing projects that will continue define her listening commentary it felt she did this 1 work with spears 2 she needed rent money 3 it was all girl cast her youthfulness will be returned not exactly typical reasons artist create blank slate with davis i wanted humor darkness or anything that would make me remember why i loved madison or half baked anything there was nothing did i expect it with crossroads probably not but it would have been nice see something that was uniquely hers road movies are made weekly it is those road films that try bring something new genre that stand out bring more table wasnt billy madison just take off back school i just question ability davis without studio baking thankfully she has taken her raw rotten talent television only further infuse masses we are left with nothing more than story what story did crossroads tell how about one lone girls quest find herself loose her virginity does that sound right again this wasnt rocket science writing yet it seemed amateur first word we know who spears love interest is going be beginning take at end is given away within first twenty minutes only strength this entire film is scene with dan aykroyd saying i was ghostbuster blues brother conehead i did this film my kids i believe that sums up this whole story nutshell needless say story lacked any depth there was one scene where we attempted bring real life screen with rape accidental death our old friend underage drinking thankfully spears could push beyond all this finally sing her songs near end obvious finale film that was started ending point didnt match with starting point this film so i watched this film everyone will have at one point their life i just shortened inevitable again it wasnt worst film ever made glitter still ranks below this but there wasnt any value final performance spears didnt push this film be made because she wanted be actress she wanted more face time with audience that seemed fence about her ability as time has shown we didnt make best assumption acting wasnt horrible but everything else was so we are left with sour taste our mouth coming all directions i will not nor suggest this film anyone except my wife who thought it was better than clerks ii ouch i will end that note grade out,0.533580415796325,0.0020560594708322042,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,"I've seen a lot better, but I've also seen a LOT worse...","Musicians trying to act in movies is nothing new. Madonna did it, Justin Guarinni did it, Kelly Clarkson did it, and most famously, Jennifer Lopez did it. In 2002, Britney Spears became yet another unfortunate statistic to the sad and growing tally of can't-act singers. Mauled by critics, ""Crossroads"" became a box office disappointment, and finally showed the world that an Oscar is nowhere in the near future for Mrs. Spears.""Crossroads"" is definitely a stinker. The plot is so indescribably simplistic that a 6yr old could follow it. The element of Britney's character finding and confronting her AWOL mother is disastrously underdone. At other times, the acting is downright ridiculous and has some of the most uninspired direction I've ever seen (closeup, medium shot, closeup, medium shot, repeat 500 times). Judging from the lead actress, ""Crossroads"" is a film aimed at the preteen crowd so naturally it should have content which is suitable for that age group. So you can imagine how shocked I was at the whole plot line of Lucy trying to loose her virginity to some loser, the saga of her friend being raped by her other friend's fiancé, who gets pregnant, and then has a miscarriage by taking a header down a flight of stairs! Yes, this is all in the movie, folks!However, those saying it's the worst film of all time have really got to see more movies. This is because ""Crossroads"" is mildly amusing to follow despite it's Goliath sized flaws. I do admit I have a soft spot for the road trip genre, and the quirkiness of several characters and their offbeat adventures kept me somewhat entertained in a vanilla state. But despite this, Crossroads is not worth the DVD price. You're much better off using that money to see a better film currently in theatres.So next time you visit your local video rental place, I advise you skip this one. It's simple, and poorly made so it's really not worth your time. If it happens to be on cable, you might be amused but I'm sure you'll find yourself changing the channel not long after it starts. 4/10",ive seen lot better but ive also seen lot worse,musicians trying act movies is nothing new madonna did it justin guarinni did it kelly clarkson did it most famously jennifer lopez did it 2002 britney spears became yet another unfortunate statistic sad growing tally cant act singers mauled by critics crossroads became box office disappointment finally showed world that oscar is nowhere near future mrs spears crossroads is definitely stinker plot is so indescribably simplistic that 6yr old could follow it element britneys character finding confronting her awol mother is disastrously underdone at other times acting is downright ridiculous has some most uninspired direction ive ever seen closeup medium shot closeup medium shot repeat 500 times judging lead actress crossroads is film aimed at preteen crowd so naturally it should have content which is suitable that age group so you can imagine how shocked i was at whole plot line lucy trying loose her virginity some loser saga her friend being raped by her other friends fianc who gets pregnant then has miscarriage by taking header down flight stairs yes this is all movie folks however those saying its worst film all time have really got see more movies this is because crossroads is mildly amusing follow despite its goliath sized flaws i do admit i have soft spot road trip genre quirkiness several characters their offbeat adventures kept me somewhat entertained vanilla state but despite this crossroads is not worth dvd price youre much better off using that money see better film currently theatres so next time you visit your local video rental place i advise you skip this one its simple poorly made so its really not worth your time if it happens be cable you might be amused but im sure youll find yourself changing channel not long after it starts 4 10,0.5029064534499319,-0.031980760785108586,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.35}"

4.0,"Not even Eye Candy, more like eye-smack","When a critic describes a movie, or anything for that matter, as being ""eye-candy"" it refers to how it looks good and tastes good but isn't good for you. I can't even use that description for Crossroads, Britney Spears first movie (and shockingly directed by the same person who once made the excellent Billy Madison and Half Baked with no sarcasm intended), which is like eye-smack since once your eyes look at the screen, you get hooked and realize when your not seeing Spears on the screen it's destroying your internal organs. In other words, Crosswords is a movie that didn't make me want to chuck my soda and snacks at the screen but only because it would smudge up some of the quick cleavage shots of Spears. Deep down, it's a horrible motion picture, the script fashioned over a weekend by somebody hired by Paramount and MTV films to churn out a script that would seem ""cute"" and ""witty"" and appeal to Britney herself most likely. All the plot elements stink- the cross country trip to the west coast with three girls and a guy tale with so many cliches even the lowest IQ'd girls in the audience would roll their eyes at, finding mom, pregnant girl, date rape, guy with guitar and ends up, uh, uh, at that point I left the theater!Bottom line, everybody should be warned before stepping into the room to view this picture, and while I would reccomend it to the usual perverts who rent PG-13 movies and use pausing the quick moments of sensuality on DVD to do you know what with what, even the seven year old girls who want to be just like Britney would want to stick to her records instead of seeing her trying to act, which she can do as well as Juanita the cafeteria lady with the one lip and gimpy leg at my school can accomplish.Grade: D- (and the reasons for it not being a complete failure, there are no reasons, after all who needs reasons when you got eye-Heroin?)",not even eye candy more like eye smack,when critic describes movie or anything that matter as being eye candy it refers how it looks good tastes good but isnt good you i cant even use that description crossroads britney spears first movie shockingly directed by same person who once made excellent billy madison half baked with no sarcasm intended which is like eye smack since once your eyes look at screen you get hooked realize when your not seeing spears screen its destroying your internal organs other words crosswords is movie that didnt make me want chuck my soda snacks at screen but only because it would smudge up some quick cleavage shots spears deep down its horrible motion picture script fashioned over weekend by somebody hired by paramount mtv films churn out script that would seem cute witty appeal britney herself most likely all plot elements stink cross country trip west coast with three girls guy tale with so many cliches even lowest iqd girls audience would roll their eyes at finding mom pregnant girl date rape guy with guitar ends up uh uh at that point i left theater bottom line everybody should be warned before stepping into room view this picture while i would reccomend it usual perverts who rent pg 13 movies use pausing quick moments sensuality dvd do you know what with what even seven year old girls who want be just like britney would want stick her records instead seeing her trying act which she can do as well as juanita cafeteria lady with one lip gimpy leg at my school can accomplish grade d reasons it not being complete failure there are no reasons after all who needs reasons when you got eye heroin,0.48796296296296304,0.12787037037037036,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"

10.0,A wonderful and fun road trip movie,"Most likely, the reason this movie receives the negative reception it does is because there is a bunch of Britney Spears haters out there, that their first intentions of this movie when they hear she is in it is, ""Just what we need; another talentless singer starring in their own cash-in, poorly made film,"" and when they sit down to watch it all they have is negative thoughts from the get-go, which of course ultimately affects their opinion of the movie in the outcome if all they have to say through the entire movie is how bad every single thing is, not even giving it a chance to be anything more. I, for one, am a Britney Spears fan, and for everyone who thinks that of course every fan would love it, that is just not true. I was able to give the actual film a chance and love it for what it is. Of course I still loved Britney, but the movie is actually really entertaining and enjoyable for me, and I strongly wish that would have been the case for more people, but it was not.The movie is just all around very fun and entertaining. It has very likable performances, a nice plot and great spunk that I find myself very amused with every time I watch it. The characters, while I admit they could have been better written, were all very lovable and excellently portrayed, and while there is a lot of dried out material, because I understand it is not a masterpiece, it was not meant to be a masterpiece to begin with and the material works for what the films tries to be, which is just a guilty pleasure, even though I am certainly not guilty for loving it. It plays out very well, spending enough time on the three girls at the beginning to give us a sense of their personalities and friendship so we can learn more about them as the film progresses, and while there are some antics along the middle of the film that some might find boring and meaningless, I thought all the mishaps and faults with the characters' lives were very relevant and meaningful. It is a bit mediocre at times, and like I said some characters, like Lucy's parents, could have been better developed, but it is ultimately satisfying to what I was looking for when I sat down to watch it.It was a nice road trip movie, and has aspired a cult following over the years by many people who see it for what it is instead of not letting themselves have a good time with it. I think it is very enjoyable and it has some heartfelt scenes, excellent songs and an overall great feel and atmosphere to it. The heinous reviews are bogus, and I would encourage anyone who may love this movie for what it is, a fun road trip movie with heart and enjoyment, to see it whenever they get the chance.",wonderful fun road trip movie,most likely reason this movie receives negative reception it does is because there is bunch britney spears haters out there that their first intentions this movie when they hear she is it is just what we need another talentless singer starring their own cash poorly made film when they sit down watch it all they have is negative thoughts get go which course ultimately affects their opinion movie outcome if all they have say through entire movie is how bad every single thing is not even giving it chance be anything more i one am britney spears fan everyone who thinks that course every fan would love it that is just not true i was able give actual film chance love it what it is course i still loved britney but movie is actually really entertaining enjoyable me i strongly wish that would have been case more people but it was not movie is just all around very fun entertaining it has very likable performances nice plot great spunk that i find myself very amused with every time i watch it characters while i admit they could have been better written were all very lovable excellently portrayed while there is lot dried out material because i understand it is not masterpiece it was not meant be masterpiece begin with material works what films tries be which is just guilty pleasure even though i am certainly not guilty loving it it plays out very well spending enough time three girls at beginning give us sense their personalities friendship so we can learn more about them as film progresses while there are some antics along middle film that some might find boring meaningless i thought all mishaps faults with characters lives were very relevant meaningful it is bit mediocre at times like i said some characters like lucys parents could have been better developed but it is ultimately satisfying what i was looking when i sat down watch it it was nice road trip movie has aspired cult following over years by many people who see it what it is instead not letting themselves have good time with it i think it is very enjoyable it has some heartfelt scenes excellent songs overall great feel atmosphere it heinous reviews are bogus i would encourage anyone who may love this movie what it is fun road trip movie with heart enjoyment see it whenever they get chance,0.6161174099269339,0.25771101033005794,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"
4.0,She has enough trouble,"So, thankfully, I wasn't stupid enough to pay to see the movie, but I watched it - all way through - on VH1, without choking on my own vomit. I also didn't have any major expectations going into the film - judging by her hopping around, which was called ""dancing,"" with her early hits, I figured her ""acting"" would be equally interesting.I'm not surprised that she wanted to act, or that people were willing to pay to see her in her first attempt and went away disappointed that her skills weren't up to par yet. Although what ""par"" is for pop musicians who try to become omni-media stars is unclear to me. ""Shanghai Surprise"" certainly set a rather low standard. I do think Britney can sing, and sings better than me, although that's faint praise. She doesn't sing songs that I always like, but she's got a nice voice. I'm thankful she did this, instead of some sort of ""Britney Revealed"" backstage movie filled with endless applications of mascara and ""I mean, we're fricking dorks!"" I don't think I could have endured that, or my nieces' endless demands to see it.I do wish the plot didn't involve Britney trying to become a singer while facing the incredible challenges of growing up (are the movie executives teenagers? How many times have we seen this plot? After the first five minutes, I could have summarized the entire movie in a three-minute voice mail and spared all of silicon valley from having to see this movie) which is, shall we tactfully say, a bit trite, for all of Britney's PR people saying it's so relevant.I'd expect to see this show up on the lifetime (victim) network at some point - the story seemed about that caliber of movie. I'm not sure there was anyone with actual quality experience in major movie making behind the wheel. The writing was terrible. Dan Ackroyd looks like he was sleepwalking in order to get through the experience. But Kim Cattrall was interesting as a bad mom (never pictured her in that role. The mom, I mean). Britney and friends were all appealing and the camera predictably loved all of them. I wish my parents spent that much on MY teeth.Acting lessons, like ballet lessons, should never end. I didn't think this wasn't a movie to completely trash - it just got too much buzz so it fell a bit hard. I'm sure Britney could use some peace right now.
