10.0,"an incredible directorial vision, and a devastating lead in Falconetti, make this one of the greatest achievements in all celluloid","Carl Th. Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc was made, perhaps, years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn't burned after its initial release, it would've had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as Citizen Kane did. Though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film, it felt like Dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema, one where reality, however cold and pitiful, was displayed with complete sincerity. There is also the editing (by Dreyer and Marguerite Beague), which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of Eisenstein, only in a totally different historical context), and those moves with the camera by Rudolph Mate (who would go on to photograph Foreign Correspondent and Lady from Shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.And it was crucial for Dreyer to use the close-ups and tilted angles and shots where you only see the eyes in the bottom of the frame, and so forth- he's developing the perfect atmosphere in regards to a trial set in 15th century France. It's all those eyes, all those faces, holding all those stolid mindsets that send Joan to her fate. Pretty soon a viewer feels these presences from all these people, so strong and uncompromising, and Dreyer does a miraculous thing- he makes it so that we forget about the time and place, and all of our attention is thrown onto those eyes of Joan, loaded to brim with a sorrow for where she is, but an un-questionable faith in what she feels about God. I wondered at one point whether Dreyer was making as much a point on people's faiths and prejudices in the almighty, or just one on basic humanity.There have been many before me who have praised Falconetti's performance to the heavens (Kael called it the finest performance in film), but in a way it almost can't be praised enough. What she achieves here is what Ebert must've felt watching Theron in the recent 'Monster'. I didn't even see her in a performance as Joan of Arc- I saw her as being the embodiment of it, as if Falconetti (with Dreyer's guidance) took Joan out of the pages of the trial transcript and her entire soul took over. There is something in an actor that has to be so compelling, so startling, and indeed so recognizable, that a person can feel empathy and/or sympathy for the person the actor's playing. All a viewer has to do is stare into Falconetti's eyes in any shot, close-up or not, and that viewer may get stirred to boiled-down emotion. For me, it was almost TOO over-whelming an emotional experience- when Joan is about to get tortured, for example, I found myself completely lost from where I was watching the film, everything in my soul and being was with Joan in that chamber, and for a minute I broke out in tears. That's the kind of effect that Dreyer's craft and all the acting work (including Eugene Sylvain as the Bishop Cauchon, and of course Artaud as Jean) can have on a viewer. I'm not saying it has to, yet The Passion of Joan of Arc could- and should- be considered a milestone in cinematic tragedy, where the images that come streaming forth never leave a viewer, and the detail for time and place becomes just that, a detail for the main stage. Love Joan or hate her, this is for keeps.",incredible directorial vision devastating lead falconetti make this one greatest achievements all celluloid,carl th dreyers passion joan arc was made perhaps years ahead its time my guess would be that if it wasnt burned after its initial release it wouldve had as stunning impact film world years down line as citizen kane did though use close ups distorted angles were not completely new this film it felt like dreyer was creating new kind cinema one where reality however cold pitiful was displayed with complete sincerity there is also editing by dreyer marguerite beague which has timing that many directors editors modern day could only hope achieve it has influence eisenstein only totally different historical context those moves with camera by rudolph mate who would go photograph foreign correspondent lady shanghai that are precious call his work film extraordinary is understatement it was crucial dreyer use close ups tilted angles shots where you only see eyes bottom frame so forth hes developing perfect atmosphere regards trial set 15th century france its all those eyes all those faces holding all those stolid mindsets that send joan her fate pretty soon viewer feels these presences all these people so strong uncompromising dreyer does miraculous thing he makes it so that we forget about time place all our attention is thrown onto those eyes joan loaded brim with sorrow where she is but un questionable faith what she feels about god i wondered at one point whether dreyer was making as much point peoples faiths prejudices almighty or just one basic humanity there have been many before me who have praised falconettis performance heavens kael called it finest performance film but way it almost cant be praised enough what she achieves here is what ebert mustve felt watching theron recent monster i didnt even see her performance as joan arc i saw her as being embodiment it as if falconetti with dreyers guidance took joan out pages trial transcript her entire soul took over there is something actor that has be so compelling so startling indeed so recognizable that person can feel empathy or sympathy person actors playing all viewer has do is stare into falconettis eyes any shot close up or not that viewer may get stirred boiled down emotion me it was almost too over whelming emotional experience when joan is about get tortured example i found myself completely lost where i was watching film everything my soul being was with joan that chamber minute i broke out tears thats kind effect that dreyers craft all acting work including eugene sylvain as bishop cauchon course artaud as jean can have viewer im not saying it has yet passion joan arc could should be considered milestone cinematic tragedy where images that come streaming forth never leave viewer detail time place becomes just that detail main stage love joan or hate her this is keeps,0.6017848943985307,0.11739554637281911,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,When Film Becomes Transcendental Art.,"It so often happens that some films take the long way to achieve their status of classics and worthy of being studied, frame by frame, by movie lovers who believe in the power of raw performance and skilled direction of cameras to depict a powerful visual set of images. When one sees films like VERTIGO which barely registered with movie-going audiences at the time of their release but after restoration went on to become one of the best films of the last century, it only shows that film, as an art, doesn't need a golden statuette to have merit, and when it's done exceptionally well, it can be seen in any context and any time period beyond its release date and will still hold its audience in awe.Carl Theodore Dryer, to me, created what I believe is, alongside Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE, the most powerful black and white film in cinema history. It would be difficult indeed to say which one is better since both films are landmark in their own cinematic styles and have been dissected frame by frame. Dryer's film has been criticized for either being a pretty collection of still images or being pure visual power: I choose the latter, because in watching THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, I felt not only the extremely uncomfortable intimacy between Joan and her tormentors, but her sublime emotions as they pass through her face as she is mocked, cross-examined, humiliated, and burned at the cross. There is an unearthly beauty in Falconetti's face as she goes through the ringer of emotions not in the overacting style typical of the Twenties but in a completely modern way, as if she were living a reality so far removed from the corrupted priests who bash and condemn her, and her reality would therefore be dangerous to their own beliefs.And what a stroke of genius, I think, to have the lighting on her face be soft, gentle, in contrast to her detractors who are always lit in harsh light which exacerbates their ugliness and betrays their ""devotion"" to God as mere politics. Dryer's style of cutting from one actor to the other is also different, and makes this film a surrealist experience, an unsettling, abstract tour through transcendental suffering. There are no defining shots which tell us where exactly is the story taking place (although we don't need to know after reading the transcripts), but we never are allowed as viewers a moment of rest from this suffocating intimacy between Joan and her inquisitors. Some bizarre shots and camera angles give the ending an even more disturbing and horrifying element of what we perceive as a gross injustice to what was a person who held her own beliefs and did not need the Church to sustain it.Falconetti never did a film before this one and never returned to film acting after this. I have not read much about her, except that she lived in Argentina until her death in 1946. I sometimes wonder why she didn't act again (although she was known to be an accomplished theatre actress more known for comedies than drama) but those are the mysteries of actors who don't have the star ego and only make a few films. She came, only did this masterful performance, and left just as suddenly, and those who re-discovered this film and restored it to its full quality have to be commended for allowing us, who have come almost 80 years later, to experience the power of subtle acting.",when film becomes transcendental art,it so often happens that some films take long way achieve their status classics worthy being studied frame by frame by movie lovers who believe power raw performance skilled direction cameras depict powerful visual set images when one sees films like vertigo which barely registered with movie going audiences at time their release but after restoration went become one best films last century it only shows that film as art doesnt need golden statuette have merit when its done exceptionally well it can be seen any context any time period beyond its release date will still hold its audience awe carl theodore dryer me created what i believe is alongside orson welles citizen kane most powerful black white film cinema history it would be difficult indeed say which one is better since both films are landmark their own cinematic styles have been dissected frame by frame dryers film has been criticized either being pretty collection still images or being pure visual power i choose latter because watching passion joan arc i felt not only extremely uncomfortable intimacy between joan her tormentors but her sublime emotions as they pass through her face as she is mocked cross examined humiliated burned at cross there is unearthly beauty falconettis face as she goes through ringer emotions not overacting style typical twenties but completely modern way as if she were living reality so far removed corrupted priests who bash condemn her her reality would therefore be dangerous their own beliefs what stroke genius i think have lighting her face be soft gentle contrast her detractors who are always lit harsh light which exacerbates their ugliness betrays their devotion god as mere politics dryers style cutting one actor other is also different makes this film surrealist experience unsettling abstract tour through transcendental suffering there are no defining shots which tell us where exactly is story taking place although we dont need know after reading transcripts but we never are allowed as viewers moment rest this suffocating intimacy between joan her inquisitors some bizarre shots camera angles give ending even more disturbing horrifying element what we perceive as gross injustice what was person who held her own beliefs did not need church sustain it falconetti never did film before this one never returned film acting after this i have not read much about her except that she lived argentina until her death 1946 i sometimes wonder why she didnt act again although she was known be accomplished theatre actress more known comedies than drama but those are mysteries actors who dont have star ego only make few films she came only did this masterful performance left just as suddenly those who re discovered this film restored it its full quality have be commended allowing us who have come almost 80 years later experience power subtle acting,0.5336390532544378,0.06525922795153563,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,The Good & Bad Of 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc',"If you'll pardon the rambling, here are my thoughts immediately after watching this on DVD an hour ago.......THE STORY - Many of the times, while watching this for the first time, I thought this was almost the re-enactment of Jesus' last day, seeing the phony trial, the trumped-up charges He endured by legalistic, power-hungry religious leaders of the day who had no clue who God is, and then the tragic end to the central character. Apparently, there were a lot of similarities to Joan of Arc's last day and of Christ's day. However, here it's the Catholic leaders who are the 'bad guys' while in Jesus' time it was the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin. Also, with Joan's story here, she is portrayed far differently in her ordeal than Christ did, the latter taking everything in stride stoically while Joan, without any physical beating, still cried constantly and signed some paper in a moment of weakness (although she later recants that, which costs the woman her life.)Anyway, about this film:THE GOOD - Wow, what incredible direction and photography. Scene after scene is pretty amazing and especially so when you consider this was made about 80 years ago! I would like to see the same director and photographer doing work with today's technology.The expressions on Maria Falconetti's face throughout the film are memorable. A sadder, more pained look on Joan of Arc - or anyone else's - I have not seen in a motion picture. She also must have set a record that still stands for the most tears shed by one person in a movie! The woman's eyes were like faucets.All of the faces in here - and the film is mostly a series of facial closeups - are amazing and kudos to Criterion for making a DVD that showed these faces with a clear picture and amazing detail. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer's camera angles still look innovative today. He and Orson Welles seem to share the same love of this kind of photography. I found myself numerous times just shaking my head in admiration for how these characters were photographed.Another big plus for this film was the addition of ""The Voices of Light."" They made the music score in here fantastic. I can't recall too many films in which I have been so impressed with a soundtrack. The DVD gives you the option of watching this film with or without that audio. I strongly recommend viewers to take the audio.Finally, the story itself is memorable, with a powerful ending.THE BAD - I have to make these comments to be fair and honest. It's not hard to understand why many people will find this film almost impossible to sit through, especially those with no emotional or spiritual involvement with the story. That is because it is extremely slow and repetitive. Shot-after-shot of just Falconetti agonizing or crying and weird-looking men staring at her. If you aren't a devotee of cinematography, this movie could be extremely boring after about 10 minutes.As powerful as the story is, it isn't a movie I would recommend for most people. I think most folks - of any age, frankly - would be turned off after 20 minutes. I understand that. As mentioned, this is not an easy film to view. This might be the longest 80-minute movie you'll ever see, if you aren't into it.OVERALL - Visually and audibly: an astounding movie and one I am glad to have finally watched. If I was wishing to get into the movie business and wanted to learn how to shoot films, this would be a film I would study numerous times. Otherwise, one viewing is plenty. I can only recommend this film to a very select audience.",good bad passion joan arc,if youll pardon rambling here are my thoughts immediately after watching this dvd hour ago story many times while watching this first time i thought this was almost re enactment jesus last day seeing phony trial trumped up charges he endured by legalistic power hungry religious leaders day who had no clue who god is then tragic end central character apparently there were lot similarities joan arcs last day christs day however here its catholic leaders who are bad guys while jesus time it was pharisees sanhedrin also with joans story here she is portrayed far differently her ordeal than christ did latter taking everything stride stoically while joan without any physical beating still cried constantly signed some paper moment weakness although she later recants that which costs woman her life anyway about this film good wow what incredible direction photography scene after scene is pretty amazing especially so when you consider this was made about 80 years ago i would like see same director photographer doing work with todays technology expressions maria falconettis face throughout film are memorable sadder more pained look joan arc or anyone elses i have not seen motion picture she also must have set record that still stands most tears shed by one person movie womans eyes were like faucets all faces here film is mostly series facial closeups are amazing kudos criterion making dvd that showed these faces with clear picture amazing detail director carl theodor dreyers camera angles still look innovative today he orson welles seem share same love this kind photography i found myself numerous times just shaking my head admiration how these characters were photographed another big plus this film was addition voices light they made music score here fantastic i cant recall too many films which i have been so impressed with soundtrack dvd gives you option watching this film with or without that audio i strongly recommend viewers take audio finally story itself is memorable with powerful ending bad i have make these comments be fair honest its not hard understand why many people will find this film almost impossible sit through especially those with no emotional or spiritual involvement with story that is because it is extremely slow repetitive shot after shot just falconetti agonizing or crying weird looking men staring at her if you arent devotee cinematography this movie could be extremely boring after about 10 minutes as powerful as story is it isnt movie i would recommend most people i think most folks any age frankly would be turned off after 20 minutes i understand that as mentioned this is not easy film view this might be longest 80 minute movie youll ever see if you arent into it overall visually audibly astounding movie one i am glad have finally watched if i was wishing get into movie business wanted learn how shoot films this would be film i would study numerous times otherwise one viewing is plenty i can only recommend this film very select audience,0.6043542074363992,0.1526826484018265,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror.,"What can one say about this work of art that has not been said many times before by those far better qualified to explain both it's importance and place as cinema and art? I shall not comment on the greatness of the film's technical achievements; the stunning cinematography, the production design, the brilliance of the screenplay based on actual transcripts from the trial, or the perfection of Mr. Dreyer's direction. The performance of Falconetti as Jeanne d' Arc has a profundity and depth far beyond my ability to illuminate. I suppose the best I can hope to do is to share my feelings, however inadequately expressed, of the effect it had on me. To say that it may be the greatest film ever made is to sound both obvious and trite. That a work of such beauty and simplicity, made seventy-six years ago can still have the power to move audiences in an era of multi-million dollar, hi-tech, bombastic over-wrought cinematic drivel is in itself a testament to the vision and genius of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Maria Falconetti and their collaborators. It is nourishment for those that hunger for something more in cinema, a feast for the soul. It is a reminder that film can indeed be art, and this film like all great works of art, lifts and transports us from the routine of our work-a-day lives to enable us, if only for a moment to experience the sublime. When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror. That is to say we look into ourselves. We question ourselves as to our own beliefs, or the lack thereof and the strength of spirit that enables an individual to endure the unendurable. Viewing it is a profound experience the nature of which for myself is transcendent rather than religious, because I am not in the least a religious person. Transcendent because it evokes emotions and thoughts that I cannot wholly account for, or adequately explain.""La Passion of Jeanne d'Arc"" is stark, radiant, exalted, simple, (but never simplistic), and ultimately sublime.

,Dreyer's masterpiece one of cinema's greatest artistic triumphs,"One of the last great silent films made during the advent of sound, Carl-Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is a haunting, riveting portrait of the historical martyr based on documentation from the original trial. Focusing primarily on the series of courtroom examinations that doomed the young warrior, the film gloriously employs vivid close-ups to accentuate the ordinariness (while at the same time exaggerating the most grotesque qualities) of Joan's inquisitors. Maria Falconetti is unforgettable as Joan, perfectly distilling the pain, terror, and saintliness required by what is probably one of the most demanding roles an actor could attempt. The consequence of Joan's conviction -- her burning at the stake -- allows Dreyer to hammer home his exquisite visual motif balancing erotic corporeality with transcendent spirituality.",dreyers masterpiece one cinemas greatest artistic triumphs,one last great silent films made during advent sound carl theodor dreyers passion joan arc is haunting riveting portrait historical martyr based documentation original trial focusing primarily series courtroom examinations that doomed young warrior film gloriously employs vivid close ups accentuate ordinariness while at same time exaggerating most grotesque qualities joans inquisitors maria falconetti is unforgettable as joan perfectly distilling pain terror saintliness required by what is probably one most demanding roles actor could attempt consequence joans conviction her burning at stake allows dreyer hammer home his exquisite visual motif balancing erotic corporeality with transcendent spirituality,0.6067460317460318,0.38015873015873014,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Devastating but brilliant masterpiece,"It's easy to overlook this movie. For modern audience and especially my generation (I'm 21), this movie is just close-ups of a crying woman and grumpy old men. But of course that's like saying Mona Lisa is just a picture of a woman, or The Last Supper is dudes eating. If you experience it with open mind, The Passion of Joan of Arc will give you one of the most profound visions of devotion, faith and martyrdom.I must confess, even I thought the praise of The Passion was too good to be true when I began to watch it. But when the film ended, I wasn't just impressed, I was completely devastated. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a downright amazing realization of Joan's last moments. There's not a hint of sentimentality, and still I was in tears. Yep. Call me a pansy, but this is one of the very few movies that had that impact on me.I don't know what else to say about this movie, sorry. The Passion of Joan of Arc counts as the most upsetting movie experience I've ever had, but it's definitely a positive one. On the contrary to what the other commentators have said, you don't have to be religious to be receptive in front of this movie. Believe me, I'm a hardcore atheist. If you're going to see this film -- I sure hope you do -- make sure it's accompanied with the Voices of Light soundtrack, which doesn't just fit the film well, but is amazing as a standalone composition, too.

Both showings were supported by a live organ play, which has been composed directly for the movie, and which suited perfectly. I had seen Nosferatu before, but i didn´t know anything about `Jeanne`, and so i was in no way prepared for this overwhelming, soul-rapturing experience.My eyes were immediately glued to the screen. Unfortunately i had missed the first minutes, so it started for me with the first (?) court scene. The camera wandered through the faces of the court members, circled and focussed on Jeanne´s face. So beautiful, naked, strong and defenseless! I could rave on the technical perfection of this film, it´s clever editing, innovative and gorgeous cinematography, proper historical settings and pure storytelling. Carl Theodor Dreyer created a masterpiece. But the most outstanding feature of this silent are the performances; Maria Falconetti delivers simply the best performance of all times, and i can´t remember of any ´corny` overacting, which distracts most silent movies from the modern viewer, even the accepted classics. `La passion de Jeanne d´Arc´ is purest cinematic art, timeless in every sense.",timeless every sense,i saw this few months ago big screen just after nosferatu another silent classic both showings were supported by live organ play which has been composed directly movie which suited perfectly i had seen nosferatu before but i didn t know anything about jeanne so i was no way prepared this overwhelming soul rapturing experience my eyes were immediately glued screen unfortunately i had missed first minutes so it started me with first court scene camera wandered through faces court members circled focussed jeanne s face so beautiful naked strong defenseless i could rave technical perfection this film it s clever editing innovative gorgeous cinematography proper historical settings pure storytelling carl theodor dreyer created masterpiece but most outstanding feature this silent are performances maria falconetti delivers simply best performance all times i can t remember any corny overacting which distracts most silent movies modern viewer even accepted classics la passion de jeanne d arc is purest cinematic art timeless every sense,0.47583333333333333,0.22891053391053393,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.25}"

9.0,One of the Most Formally Striking Movies I've Ever Seen,"Carl Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is a film that feels light years ahead of its time. Lean and mean, focusing its entire narrative on the interrogation of Joan that inevitably lead to her execution by burning at the stake, the film is kinetic in ways that most films even now aren't. Composed almost completely of tight close ups, Dreyer and crew cut rapidly between disconcerting, asymmetrical shots, giving the film a breathless, anxious, nearly frenzied pace.Maria Falconetti gives an almost unbelievably intense performance as the title heroine. Her performance, and the film in general, does get a bit monotonous -- it exists primarily of impassioned gazes into the middle distance, giant, tearing eyes opened wide, an expression of passionate, nearly demented religious fervor on her face. It's not a film that concerns itself with characters and plot, so we don't get to know Joan as a person. It's difficult to care for her particular plight and we instead feel compassion for her as one human being feeling compassion for another. For that reason, the film left me remembering its striking images and formal style more than any emotions I might have felt while watching it. But it's no less of a remarkable cinematic achievement for that.Grade: A",one most formally striking movies ive ever seen,carl dreyers passion joan arc is film that feels light years ahead its time lean mean focusing its entire narrative interrogation joan that inevitably lead her execution by burning at stake film is kinetic ways that most films even now arent composed almost completely tight close ups dreyer crew cut rapidly between disconcerting asymmetrical shots giving film breathless anxious nearly frenzied pace maria falconetti gives almost unbelievably intense performance as title heroine her performance film general does get bit monotonous it exists primarily impassioned gazes into middle distance giant tearing eyes opened wide expression passionate nearly demented religious fervor her face its not film that concerns itself with characters plot so we dont get know joan as person its difficult care her particular plight we instead feel compassion her as one human being feeling compassion another that reason film left me remembering its striking images formal style more than any emotions i might have felt while watching it but its no less remarkable cinematic achievement that grade,0.5552933673469388,0.11996173469387757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,A film so heartbreakingly realistic and brutally honest it might even bring tears to your eyes,"Part of what makes The Passion of Joan of Arc so bold and unflinching, for its time and its current state in cinema, is, much like its titular subject, how battered, beaten, and kicked around it has been in order to get where it is today. This is a film that, from its very inception, was a controversial subject that clerical authorities didn't want to be seen by a wide audience, for its portrayal of religion and politics. Nonetheless, writer/director Carl Theodor Dreyer pushed forward in a direction for a film on Joan of Arc that detailed the gap between religion and politics, in addition to insights into the complex of the fragile male ego that boasts assimilation and manipulation. After the completed and finalized print was lost in a fire, it was doubtful that a print even close to the original would ever resurface until one was discovered in a mental institution in Oslo, Norway in the 1980's. After some cleaning up and polish was added, the film was restored into an eighty-one minute cut, which is said to be very close to the original film's length and structure.Dreyer's focus in The Passion of Joan of Arc was precisely what the title suggests; an intimate and often harrowing portrayal of the agony the French heroine (played ever-so tenderly by Renée Jeanne Falconetti) endured following her unfair trial after the Hundred Years' War. Dreyer sees no point or purpose in showcasing sweeping battle sequences nor does he see it fit to detail Joan of Arc's story in a series of ""greatest hits"" moments that ultimately ends in a corrupt sentencing. Instead, Dreyer places us, the audience, in an awkward position throughout; we are practically voyeurs into the trial and sentencing of Joan of Arc, who we witness subjected to enough physical and mental torment to shatter one's entire self-worth. As she takes a stand for her faith and her beliefs of her own personal sainthood and relationship with God, she is bludgeoned and abused by an all-male jury and various authorities before being sentenced to death by being consumed by fire.The Passion of Joan of Arc can be viewed in two basic forms; in its original form, with no dialog, or a modified, Criterion Collection version that adds accompanying orchestration from Richard Einhorn called ""Voices of Light"" (which was my audio-track companion) throughout the film. Einhorn's score provides well-timed parallels in sound and musicality to events transpired on-screen, and the symphonic blend of instruments at various times adds to the cacophony of emotions and tones throughout the picture in a way that wouldn't be as impacting, I feel, with an empty audio-track. Dreyer's film has far too much potential for impact to be viewed in complete and utter silence.Dreyer's decision to focus largely on facial expressions and the facial personalities of characters almost overshadows the complex work of his and Rudolph Maté's in the cinematography department. At the time of its release, The Passion of Joan of Arc erected one of the most expensive and immaculately detailed film sets in the history of cinema, with its construction of the famous Rouen Castle taking most of Dreyer's seven million franc budget on the film. Having said that, the detail in the background of the film is almost as important as the detail in the foreground, with hulking walls and set architecture towering over the characters in the film like a bitter and obvious presence. The walls are nothing more than helpless witnesses to the atrocious treatment of a very confident woman; so confident she makes her male counterparts squirm with inferiority and fear.Out of eighty-one minutes, probably a good forty or forty-five are Dreyer's camera lingering and depicting the facial and emotional reactions of Joan of Arc. Dreyer allows us to zero in on Joan of Arc's emotional responses as a way of peeling back the events of this film and revealing a tender, more human side that can often get lost in the shuffle. This is also likely why Dreyer forgoes the conventional battle sequences the Hundred Years' War practically loans itself to on film; it doesn't work to detail the kind of grounded human interest in the film.Finally, there's the concept of male ego that Dreyer subtly explores here. Consider how manipulated Joan of Arc becomes shortly after allowing herself to be tried for blasphemous remarks about her alleged sainthood and her relationship with God. Her trial was never intended to be fair, but instead, a circus for masculinity to triumph over a defenseless woman who was never going to be heard out on anything she had to say. As a result, the males of the court room decide to shame her, cutting off all her hair and physically and mentally abusing her in a barbaric manner that shows little else besides dominance over the meek and powerless in a cruel situation.The result is a heartbreaking film that grabs you with an all-too-real depiction of a time period frequently obscured by the lingo of textbooks and droll college lectures thanks to Dreyer's human approach and intimate focus on facial expressions and steadfast realism. It's only fitting that The Passion of Joan of Arc endured such a brutal life trying to gets its message out to a wide audience; it perfectly replicates the struggle and fight of its titular character.Starring: Renée Jeanne Falconetti.

10.0,Falconetti is amazing!,"A certain amount of credit must surely be paid to the director for the genius of 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc.' The daring camera angles, use of incessant close-ups and peculiar authenticity all may be attributed to Carl Th. Dryer. However, Renee Maria Falconetti is the reason this film indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching the Platonic form of brilliance. Her performance is breathtaking by all accounts. One can not help but remain mesmerized by her expressions. Yes Dryer's gift to us of so many wonderful close shots of Falconetti should be acknowledged. He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenes to produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in this timeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have been considered) is to envision a less than perfect film. Unimpeded by the silent medium in which she worked, Falconetti's mere tilt of the head or gentle glance pierce the soul of the viewer. We see her speak in Jeanne's native tongue. We see her compelling portrayal of the anguish which the saint most certainly endured. It is almost as if we are watching what the director said he had found; the martyr's reincarnation! This actress presents to us her raw beauty unmarred by powders or makeup - thanks to a decision of Dryer. How bitter-sweet the fact that we have this once thought to be lost silent film and yet can not help now but to long for more Falconetti. And so we return to 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' and with each of many tears and inaudible sighs marvel at the staggering accomplishment which is Renee Maria Falconetti's Jeanne.",falconetti is amazing,certain amount credit must surely be paid director genius la passion de jeanne darc daring camera angles use incessant close ups peculiar authenticity all may be attributed carl th dryer however renee maria falconetti is reason this film indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching platonic form brilliance her performance is breathtaking by all accounts one can not help but remain mesmerized by her expressions yes dryers gift us so many wonderful close shots falconetti should be acknowledged he must be praised his relentless filming scenes produce desired result yet imagine anyone else this timeless role such as lillian gish who was said have been considered is envision less than perfect film unimpeded by silent medium which she worked falconettis mere tilt head or gentle glance pierce soul viewer we see her speak jeannes native tongue we see her compelling portrayal anguish which saint most certainly endured it is almost as if we are watching what director said he had found martyrs reincarnation this actress presents us her raw beauty unmarred by powders or makeup thanks decision dryer how bitter sweet fact that we have this once thought be lost silent film yet can not help now but long more falconetti so we return la passion de jeanne darc with each many tears inaudible sighs marvel at staggering accomplishment which is renee maria falconettis jeanne,0.556954398258746,0.28396241439719705,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.22}"

8.0,"""You can claim that I am sent by the devil..., it's not true...""","When the list of IMDb's top films include multiple titles given to animated features and a fair share of movies that are just downright goofy (""Life of Brian"", ""Groundhog Day""), it's reassuring to find a gem in the mix like ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"". Originally released as a completely silent film, I opted to watch it with the accompaniment of the 'Voices of Light' soundtrack, which renders the story in a much more spiritual manner.Accused of blasphemy, Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) is placed on trial for refusing to recant her assertions that she's had visions of St. Michael, and that she was directed by the voice of God to take charge of her country's army and lead it to victory. In that regard, the picture's principal negative is that it's not placed in historical context, and one does not know the events taking place during the period of time the woman lived. It actually occurred during the latter half of The Hundred Years War (1337-1453) between England and France. Jeanne's involvement in the conflict turned a long standing Anglo-French conflict into something of a religious war, as her importance to the French cause grew over the course of time.One will be struck by the completely one sided nature of Jeanne's trial, one in which every theologian and judge mocked her replies and judged her responses as blasphemous. What's striking is the portrayal Maria Falconetti brings to her character, she is at the same time terrified of her ordeal, but sublime in the way she accepts her fate. It's one of the more impressive performances one would be fortunate enough to see, particularly coming from cinema's silent era. I think it's safe to say that even if one were not religiously inclined, there's an underlying spiritual power and presence that takes hold of the viewer while watching.

9.0,One of the All-Time Greatest Movies,"A chronicle of the trial of Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) on charges of heresy, and the efforts of her ecclesiastical jurists to force Jeanne to recant her claims of holy visions.Dreyer really loves his close-ups in this picture, stressing the rough humanity of the faces -- they are not pretty, but full of emotion and contour. I can see why it was a commercial flop, as it is not terribly entertaining... but the pure genius of the film can be appreciated from a critical point of view.Mordaunt Hall said ""as a film work of art this takes precedence over anything that has so far been produced. It makes worthy pictures of the past look like tinsel shams. It fills one with such intense admiration that other pictures appear but trivial in comparison."" That might be a bit of a stretch, but I can hardly disagree too strongly. My only real complaint is that Joan of Arc was 19 at the time of trial... and Falconetti was 35 or 36. But I cannot fault her acting.The Criterion Collection comes with Richard Einhorn's ""Voices of Light"" as an optional score to the film. I strongly recommend this. While the film is powerful even silent, Einhorn nailed the feeling and more...

8.0,silent masterpiece,"Oak Cliff Film Festival 2018 Greetings again from the darkness. It's a rare treat to watch a 90 year old silent movie. Especially in a remastered format. Especially on the big screen. Especially at a historic theatre. Especially with a nearly packed house. And especially with a live score! The 7th annual Oak Cliff Film Festival, held at the Texas Theatre (opened 1931), afforded just such a treat with its Friday evening screening.Most know the story of Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc), a teenage heroine of France for her role in the Hundred Year War. She claimed that she received spiritual and religious guidance through voices and visions. Once she was captured by English allies, she was charged with heresy and burned at the stake in Rouen in 1431. A quarter century later, the Pope declared her a martyr and she became a symbol of France - canonized as a saint in 1920. Of course, here the story is as much about the film as it is the martyr and historical figure.The eyes are what first grab our attention. The eyes of actress Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. It was Falconetti's only screen appearance, and though she spent the rest of her career on stage, this role cemented her place in cinematic history. Without the benefit of sound and voice, the silent era performer had to emote through eyes, facial expression and body movement. Few ever did it better than Falconetti. It's gut-wrenching to watch the church counsel attempt to break her resolve. Our minds hear the intensity of their voices though we only read the subtitles. Renowned Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer directs the script from writer Joseph Delteil (taken mostly from the transcripts of the trial), and the cinematography is through the eye of 5 time Oscar nominee Rudolph Mate' (FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES). It's impossible not to notice a style so different from modern day filmmaking. The harsh lighting and almost exclusive use of close-ups and medium shots bring an immediacy of which we aren't accustomed. The single piece set is quite unusual and provides a stage aura. Another thing that stands out is the editing style. Continuity of scene wasn't important here. What mattered was the sense of frantic pacing and over-bearing stress brought on by the rapid-fire questioning. We share the claustrophobic feeling with Joan, though of course, we know where this is all headed.As part of this special showing, the Oak Cliff Film Festival arranged for a live score performed by composer George Sarah, a 4 piece chamber orchestra, and a vocal group accompanying the music. Perhaps this meant even more to me since I visited Rouen last year, and the lasting legacy (almost 600 years) of this courageous young woman is evident throughout much of France. The re-mastered film is stunning to look at, and even more historically important knowing that the film had long thought to be lost to a fire. The story and the film are quite something to experience.",silent masterpiece,oak cliff film festival 2018 greetings again darkness its rare treat watch 90 year old silent movie especially remastered format especially big screen especially at historic theatre especially with nearly packed house especially with live score 7th annual oak cliff film festival held at texas theatre opened 1931 afforded just such treat with its friday evening screening most know story joan arc jeanne darc teenage heroine france her role hundred year war she claimed that she received spiritual religious guidance through voices visions once she was captured by english allies she was charged with heresy burned at stake rouen 1431 quarter century later pope declared her martyr she became symbol france canonized as saint 1920 course here story is as much about film as it is martyr historical figure eyes are what first grab our attention eyes actress maria falconetti as joan arc it was falconettis only screen appearance though she spent rest her career stage this role cemented her place cinematic history without benefit sound voice silent era performer had emote through eyes facial expression body movement few ever did it better than falconetti its gut wrenching watch church counsel attempt break her resolve our minds hear intensity their voices though we only read subtitles renowned danish filmmaker carl theodor dreyer directs script writer joseph delteil taken mostly transcripts trial cinematography is through eye 5 time oscar nominee rudolph mate foreign correspondent pride yankees its impossible not notice style so different modern day filmmaking harsh lighting almost exclusive use close ups medium shots bring immediacy which we arent accustomed single piece set is quite unusual provides stage aura another thing that stands out is editing style continuity scene wasnt important here what mattered was sense frantic pacing over bearing stress brought by rapid fire questioning we share claustrophobic feeling with joan though course we know where this is all headed as part this special showing oak cliff film festival arranged live score performed by composer george sarah 4 piece chamber orchestra vocal group accompanying music perhaps this meant even more me since i visited rouen last year lasting legacy almost 600 years this courageous young woman is evident throughout much france re mastered film is stunning look at even more historically important knowing that film had long thought be lost fire story film are quite something experience,0.4287316849816849,0.0878225940725941,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,Brilliantly filmed but with an odd performance by Joan.,"""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"" is probably the most famous work of Danish film maker Carl Theodor Dreyer. Unlike the typical biographical film, this one is based completely on the court proceedings in the trial of Joan--not some fictional or semi-fictional story written in 1928. This is pretty wild, as many historical films view truth as very flexible--with the real emphasis being on entertainment. If this means inventing characters or changing history--so be it! But, fortunately, not in this film! It's a history teacher's delight! When the film began, I sure was bowled over by the powerful soundtrack filled with Latin liturgical singing. While annoying normally, here with the intensity of the film and the subject matter is managed to work. In addition, the film is an artistic piece due to the director Dreyer's artistic vision. First, his choices of actors was truly amazing--as he chose some of the most amazing faces I've seen in a film--such character, such intensity and such acting from these people is truly amazing. Plus the camera pulls so much from the actors due to fantastic lighting and clarity of focus--you can even very clearly see the pores on many of the actor's faces! Second, unlike almost all other silent films and even sound ones, this one makes great use of closeups and inventive camera angles to heighten the intensity of the action as well as the impact on the audience. The result is a film that hits you in the face--hard, forceful and impossible to ignore. Especially strong in its impact is the execution itself--Dreyer chose to make incredibly vivid (so much so, some might find it very disturbing).Now I must say that although I greatly admired this, there was, at times, a downside. The actress that played Joan (Maria Falconetti) often looked downright crazed--like she was off her medication and reeeaalllly needed it!! While this could actually be true (after all, she was seeing things and having conversations with dead folks), I doubt if Dreyer wanted his audience to think Joan of Arc was nuts--as she so often appeared in the film. This is sad, really, as at other times, Ms. Falconetti did a masterful job--showing great sorrow and crying most convincingly. But, in many cases, after crying and emoting wonderfully, moments later she was staring off into space like she was stoned. I know this film is considered one of the great films of the silent age, but I don't know how this can be based on the truly bizarre and inconsistent characterization of Joan. Yes, I dare question Dreyer's brilliance in this respect. Overall, there's a lot to love and a lot that makes you question the film's ""classic"" status.

,Sensory Shift,"This film almost leads one to believe that sound betrays the emotion the eyes capture. Just as the blind develop hearing far better than the average, the deaf develop a keen sense of sight. I am convinced that a lack of dialogue forces us to read the language of the face and body, a verbage unmatched in beauty and nuance. Though the accompanying musical piece (be careful not to identify it as a score), so deliciously inspired by the film, enhances the visual playground; it is the actors' faces that comprise this tour de force. Ms. Falconetti shifts from worry and doubt to unabashed conviction in a single shot, giving the viewer the luck of seeing one's thoughts in progress. She needs no response to the interrogation, it's all in her face. Renee is not superficially beautiful and the lack of make-up only reinforces how bare Joan is, but it is the uncanny ability of an incomparable stage actor to be a window into the soul that makes her so stunning, for the soul we see is one we only wish to attain for ourselves. The Church sees what we see, and they respond just as clearly to her unspoken protest with vehement pomp. The cinematography is so astounding for its time no comment could ever do it justice. Though many comments can be made, and are, surrounding the inspiration and detail for the set, it is at its core an incredible gift from Dreyer to the actors meant to inspire. It plays little part in the film, but to pull an inconceivable last drop of reality from the actors.

8.0,Watch it for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance,"Director Carl Theodor Dreyer created a unique experience with this film, employing low camera angles, unique editing, and a ton of tight shots on his actors to get an intensity of emotion from them, Maria Falconetti (as Jeanne d'Arc) in particular. The story focuses on just her trial and execution, which has the advantage that it makes the film taut and Kafkaesque, but the disadvantage that additional context would have told a richer story. Do we really see Jeanne d'Arc here? I'm not so sure, historical transcript notwithstanding, though I did find it fascinating that she refused to change out of her men's clothing. While performances are strong and the film is ahead of its time, the content is dark, and not particularly uplifting, especially if you're a non-believer. There is of course a universal theme in a righteous person standing up to persecution - being mocked, threatened, and tortured - but at the end of the day, it's simple Jeanne, believing she was sent by God, standing up against the established clergy, who, threatened by her assertions, believe she was sent by the Devil. The film never ponders whether both may be deluded, and concludes with her soul being protected by the flames as it rises to heaven.

10.0,A contender for THE movie of the 1920s,"As much as I did love Metropolis, The Gold Rush and Faust(1926), The Passion of Joan of Arc is a contender for the movie of the 1920s, that's how amazing it is. It is an incredibly well made film, it draws on artistic styles from the Renaissance through to the avant-garde and with all the symbolic angles, zooms, tilts and pan shoots the photography is spellbinding and captures the authentic costumes, sets and scenery wonderfully.The Passion of Joan of Arc is also a very haunting film, as what it does have is an atmosphere that is so genuine and unsettling. It is beautifully directed by Carl Th Dreyer, and the story based on trial records is highly compelling and genuinely dramatically intense in its action. Other than the atmosphere and visuals, what makes The Passion of Joan of Arc is the lead performance.

10.0,"Dreyer's ""Realized Mysticism""","*Note: This a review of the Criterion Edition DVD with the ""Voices of Light"" accompaniment. Over the decades Dreyer's film was a victim of religious and politic censors, two fires that destroyed valuable prints, unauthorized cuts, and zealous editors working against his wishes to modernize the film. An original, uncensored cut was found miraculously in a Norwegian hospital for the mentally ill (ironic?) in 1981 and fully restored for the Criterion Collection. Famed composer Richard Einhorn created his libretto, ""Voices of Light"", in response to his own experiences viewing the film and researching the history of Joan of Arc. The film can be viewed with or without the accompaniment, though I can't imagine Dreyer would've objected as Einhorn with great care honored the spirit of the film and arguably of Saint Joan with his compositions.Carl Dreyer's silent film, ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", is a shocking example of the potential of film as art. No amount of scholarly critique can account for the raw power in viewing the film. It's one of those rare experiences that can only be seen to be understood. Dreyer's meticulously crafted aesthetics (the film is almost entirely composed of close-ups of the actors' faces) are perfectly married to the gut wrenching performance of Maria Falconetti (a theater star who never acted in another film) in the lead role. I think Dreyer was most accurate in describing her performance as nothing short of ""the martyr's reincarnation."" One need not be religious to understand what is meant or to feel for Joan as portrayed so humanely and exquisitely by Falconetti. Her face is beyond the realm of haunting, and Dreyer seers it into the audience's memory along with other stunning imagery like a window frame's shadow turning into a cross on the floor, worms crawling through a skull unearthed from a freshly dug grave, or a bored executioner barely able to hold up his head in the company of his torture devices. And then there's the burning at the stake and the brutal suppression of the peasant riot--unimaginable horrors rendered so beautifully and hyper realized onto a series of moving images projected onto a blank screen.The genius of Dreyer's visuals and Falconetti's performance is that they create a deep psychological complexity that can engage a modern viewer on multiple levels. In their bold suggestions and through the artistic integrity of their respective crafts, Dreyer and Falconetti leave it to their audience (weather it be a French nation still celebrating and mythologizing their 15th century hero Joan a mere eight years after her canonization in 1920 or a more skeptical 21st scholar studying the history of film) to decide the veracity of Joan's convictions. Was Joan truly a mystic, a martyr, a saint? Or was she simply mad and the unfortunate victim of the time period in which she lived and died? Either way, she is presented here as human. And in relating to her, one thing is for sure: the mysticism of film was realized by the Dane Carl Dreyer and Maria Falconetti in the year 1928 with ""The Passion of Joan of Arc.""",dreyers realized mysticism,note this review criterion edition dvd with voices light accompaniment over decades dreyers film was victim religious politic censors two fires that destroyed valuable prints unauthorized cuts zealous editors working against his wishes modernize film original uncensored cut was found miraculously norwegian hospital mentally ill ironic 1981 fully restored criterion collection famed composer richard einhorn created his libretto voices light response his own experiences viewing film researching history joan arc film can be viewed with or without accompaniment though i cant imagine dreyer wouldve objected as einhorn with great care honored spirit film arguably saint joan with his compositions carl dreyers silent film passion joan arc is shocking example potential film as art no amount scholarly critique can account raw power viewing film its one those rare experiences that can only be seen be understood dreyers meticulously crafted aesthetics film is almost entirely composed close ups actors faces are perfectly married gut wrenching performance maria falconetti theater star who never acted another film lead role i think dreyer was most accurate describing her performance as nothing short martyrs reincarnation one need not be religious understand what is meant or feel joan as portrayed so humanely exquisitely by falconetti her face is beyond realm haunting dreyer seers it into audiences memory along with other stunning imagery like window frames shadow turning into cross floor worms crawling through skull unearthed freshly dug grave or bored executioner barely able hold up his head company his torture devices then theres burning at stake brutal suppression peasant riot unimaginable horrors rendered so beautifully hyper realized onto series moving images projected onto blank screen genius dreyers visuals falconettis performance is that they create deep psychological complexity that can engage modern viewer multiple levels their bold suggestions through artistic integrity their respective crafts dreyer falconetti leave it their audience weather it be french nation still celebrating mythologizing their 15th century hero joan mere eight years after her canonization 1920 or more skeptical 21st scholar studying history film decide veracity joans convictions was joan truly mystic martyr saint or was she simply mad unfortunate victim time period which she lived died either way she is presented here as human relating her one thing is sure mysticism film was realized by dane carl dreyer maria falconetti year 1928 with passion joan arc,0.5454168847025991,0.07624280481423337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7.0,over-rated but interesting,"It is often said that Maria Falconetti gave the greatest performance in the history of film acting in this movie. That's nonsense. First off, I don't believe anyone can be said to be the single best artist in any pursuit. Shakespeare is not really the greatest playwright to ever live. But now that people keep saying he's the greatest playwright ever no one has the nerve to suggest perhaps he's just one of many brilliant playwrights.As for Falconetti, she gives a rather stylized performance in a very stylized, visually striking, very artsy movie. Her performance consists of a couple of looks, suffering and rapture, and in both she looks a little nuts, although I was never clear if she was supposed to seem nuts.The main power of her performance comes from a sense of pure exhaustion, and from what I hear the directory did everything he could to wear her down, so it may be less a great performance than just watching someone suffer on screen.The movie itself is cool looking but artificial and not that convincing. Those looking to see a truly great performance in a truly great silent movie should check out Emil Jannings in The Last Laugh.",over rated but interesting,it is often said that maria falconetti gave greatest performance history film acting this movie thats nonsense first off i dont believe anyone can be said be single best artist any pursuit shakespeare is not really greatest playwright ever live but now that people keep saying hes greatest playwright ever no one has nerve suggest perhaps hes just one many brilliant playwrights as falconetti she gives rather stylized performance very stylized visually striking very artsy movie her performance consists couple looks suffering rapture both she looks little nuts although i was never clear if she was supposed seem nuts main power her performance comes sense pure exhaustion what i hear directory did everything he could wear her down so it may be less great performance than just watching someone suffer screen movie itself is cool looking but artificial not that convincing those looking see truly great performance truly great silent movie should check out emil jannings last laugh,0.5236726874657909,0.28917811116086983,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,The Legendary Falconetti Anchors Dreyer Silent Classic,"I was completely floored when I first saw this movie in the basement of the San Jose Main Library sometime in the early seventies. The mesmerizing performance of Maria (Renée) Falconetti, filmed primarily as a series of brutalizing close-ups, is still the main reason to revisit Carl Theodor Dreyer's austere and claustrophobic 1928 silent film classic about the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. There is little provided in the way of background or context, as Dreyer made an intentional decision to use the original trial records as the basis of his dialogue. Using a minimum of sets, almost abstract in orientation, he uses the camera frame as his canvas by showing the bullying interrogation of Joan by her inquisitors in a series of face shots against a white backdrop. The actors had to use their make-up-free faces as their sole means of expression. There are never any establishing shots, so the viewer never knows where the characters are in relationship to each other. Instead, Dreyer uses dramatic camera angles to convey people's position in the story. As the film builds to its climax, graphic footage of Joan being burned at the stake alternates with sequences of angry French peasants being brutally driven out of Rouen Castle by club-wielding English soldiers. Many of the shots feel abstract and out of proportion to convey a world turned upside down.The overall effect of these creative and daring techniques gives the film a more contemporary feeling than a standard silent, and luckily, adding to the freshness of the treatment is a pristine print found in Copenhagen, the basis of the transfer in this Criterion Collection DVD. An effectively stirring enhancement is Richard Einhorn's beautiful ""Voices of Light"", an oratorio specifically written to accompany the film decades after its release. Falconetti was 35 when she played the 19-year old peasant girl, but she is entirely convincing using her large eyes and facial plains to build her character's spirit as it dwindles under the pressure of the French clergymen who rule her fate. One truly believes her assertion that she is a messenger for God. Never to act on screen again, she gives a truly legendary performance deserving of the hosannas received over the years. The DVD contains an interesting commentary track on which Dreyer scholar Casper Tybjerg provides a wealth of information. It also contains features on the film's unusually stylized production design, Einhorn's music, and the checkered history of the many versions that ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" has gone through over the years. In spite of its unrelenting tone and some scenes that will make you wince, it's a masterwork that still resonates 77 years later.",legendary falconetti anchors dreyer silent classic,i was completely floored when i first saw this movie basement san jose main library sometime early seventies mesmerizing performance maria ren e falconetti filmed primarily as series brutalizing close ups is still main reason revisit carl theodor dreyers austere claustrophobic 1928 silent film classic about trial execution joan arc there is little provided way background or context as dreyer made intentional decision use original trial records as basis his dialogue using minimum sets almost abstract orientation he uses camera frame as his canvas by showing bullying interrogation joan by her inquisitors series face shots against white backdrop actors had use their make up free faces as their sole means expression there are never any establishing shots so viewer never knows where characters are relationship each other instead dreyer uses dramatic camera angles convey peoples position story as film builds its climax graphic footage joan being burned at stake alternates with sequences angry french peasants being brutally driven out rouen castle by club wielding english soldiers many shots feel abstract out proportion convey world turned upside down overall effect these creative daring techniques gives film more contemporary feeling than standard silent luckily adding freshness treatment is pristine print found copenhagen basis transfer this criterion collection dvd effectively stirring enhancement is richard einhorns beautiful voices light oratorio specifically written accompany film decades after its release falconetti was 35 when she played 19 year old peasant girl but she is entirely convincing using her large eyes facial plains build her characters spirit as it dwindles under pressure french clergymen who rule her fate one truly believes her assertion that she is messenger god never act screen again she gives truly legendary performance deserving hosannas received over years dvd contains interesting commentary track which dreyer scholar casper tybjerg provides wealth information it also contains features films unusually stylized production design einhorns music checkered history many versions that passion joan arc has gone through over years spite its unrelenting tone some scenes that will make you wince its masterwork that still resonates 77 years later,0.46199570105820104,0.16728257275132274,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.46}"
8.0,Haunting Portrayal,"A fairly well known religious story, French director Carl Theodor Dreyer made The Passion of Joan of Arc in 1928. Because it is silent and in black and white, facial expressions via frequent close ups must convey the sincerity of the subject. Whether she was insane and delusional or was actually hearing the voice of God is up to the viewer to decide. I have to separate my personal views as a retired Catholic from my review. Joan is played magnificently by Renee Jeanne Falconetti, who so convincingly portrays the future saints' emotional character so well. Her performance has been hailed by many as one of the best ever captured on film. The transcript of her trial is used as the basis, with judges on a panel interrogating Joan and doubting her message from above, to drive the English from France. Even under torture, she never relents, and it is not a spoiler to mention the burning at the stake, which is not a secret. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a work of art, regardless of ones beliefs about the supernatural. Ms. Falconetti's last role is a memorable one, which should be studied by everyone in the acting profession for a lesson in perfection.",haunting portrayal,fairly well known religious story french director carl theodor dreyer made passion joan arc 1928 because it is silent black white facial expressions via frequent close ups must convey sincerity subject whether she was insane delusional or was actually hearing voice god is up viewer decide i have separate my personal views as retired catholic my review joan is played magnificently by renee jeanne falconetti who so convincingly portrays future saints emotional character so well her performance has been hailed by many as one best ever captured film transcript her trial is used as basis with judges panel interrogating joan doubting her message above drive english france even under torture she never relents it is not spoiler mention burning at stake which is not secret passion joan arc is work art regardless ones beliefs about supernatural ms falconettis last role is memorable one which should be studied by everyone acting profession lesson perfection,0.3778846153846154,0.12820512820512822,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,Transcends all Generations,"Roger Ebert once said that ""to see Falconetti in Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is to look into eyes that will never leave you."" I cannot find a better statement for this miracle of a silent masterpiece. What has been mastered here is a view, taken from historical record, and put under a microscope figuratively and literally on screen to dive into the spiritual essence of destiny. This film is in a class by itself, and had a profound impact on this viewer.The film begins during the 100 Years War in France. In its battle against its enemy England, a commoner rose through the ranks to lead France to many great victories. This great warrior was peasant girl Joan of Arc, not even 18 years old but commanded a presence among her peers and a reputation impressed upon her enemies. Joan has been promised French deliverance from the mouth of God himself. Captured and put on what is essentially a mock trial for the whole film (she would have most likely been executed anyway) she must stand firm against the cacophony of priests who at first spit at her and call her a demon who cries blasphemy. Soon however, when she is given the chance to free herself at the expense of her devout belief in God and refuses, the film becomes a tragedy of the rest form, a good person making the ultimate sacrifice to something bigger than anyone in this film can possibly imagine. The mastery of this film's narrative is in its reliance on the extreme close-up, which i can only estimate takes up 95% of the film. Director Dryer and cinematographer Rudolf Mate take a radical approach to the film, which has stood the test of time as one of the most daring films ever made. Joan's face as well as the other characters fill the frame, and what was not normal for the silent films, the actors do not wear any make-up at all. What this gives is confinement in the audience, as wee are as locked in this small blank room as Joan is, thus helping us feel the emotions of the scenes and care for the main character in a unique way. We cannot look away from the faces, especially that of Joan's astonishingly beautiful eyes.What stands out in this film is the central performance of Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. When she enters the picture, she does not look like a common heroine. She has short hair, no make-up, and no soft lighting to make her ""gorgeous."" In this way, Falconetti must communicate a visceral reaction and emotions through her facial expressions, and since she is always in close-up, this cannot escape and she cannot cheat. With this said, this is a truly flawless performance, in fact one of the greatest films I have ever seen in Cinema history. When she does stumble and ultimately does the ""morally right"" thing, I broke down in tears, quite rarely have I ever had so much respect and heartbreak over a person I never knew. This is a bravura performance that I cannot praise enough.The Passion of Joan of Arc is a miracle, and when given again the fact that it was made in the 1920s, this is even more astonishing. Please see this film and judge for yourself.Note: I am sorry I haven't written in a long time. College and work is murder and time must be put elsewhere quite a lot. But I intend to write more and this film helped me rekindle the flame that git me to doing this in the first place - Theflyace""",transcends all generations,roger ebert once said that see falconetti dreyers passion joan arc is look into eyes that will never leave you i cannot find better statement this miracle silent masterpiece what has been mastered here is view taken historical record put under microscope figuratively literally screen dive into spiritual essence destiny this film is class by itself had profound impact this viewer film begins during 100 years war france its battle against its enemy england commoner rose through ranks lead france many great victories this great warrior was peasant girl joan arc not even 18 years old but commanded presence among her peers reputation impressed upon her enemies joan has been promised french deliverance mouth god himself captured put what is essentially mock trial whole film she would have most likely been executed anyway she must stand firm against cacophony priests who at first spit at her call her demon who cries blasphemy soon however when she is given chance free herself at expense her devout belief god refuses film becomes tragedy rest form good person making ultimate sacrifice something bigger than anyone this film can possibly imagine mastery this films narrative is its reliance extreme close up which i can only estimate takes up 95 film director dryer cinematographer rudolf mate take radical approach film which has stood test time as one most daring films ever made joans face as well as other characters fill frame what was not normal silent films actors do not wear any make up at all what this gives is confinement audience as wee are as locked this small blank room as joan is thus helping us feel emotions scenes care main character unique way we cannot look away faces especially that joans astonishingly beautiful eyes what stands out this film is central performance maria falconetti as joan arc when she enters picture she does not look like common heroine she has short hair no make up no soft lighting make her gorgeous this way falconetti must communicate visceral reaction emotions through her facial expressions since she is always close up this cannot escape she cannot cheat with this said this is truly flawless performance fact one greatest films i have ever seen cinema history when she does stumble ultimately does morally right thing i broke down tears quite rarely have i ever had so much respect heartbreak over person i never knew this is bravura performance that i cannot praise enough passion joan arc is miracle when given again fact that it was made 1920s this is even more astonishing please see this film judge yourself note i am sorry i havent written long time college work is murder time must be put elsewhere quite lot but i intend write more this film helped me rekindle flame that git me doing this first place theflyace,0.5648738662131518,0.20857426303854876,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
