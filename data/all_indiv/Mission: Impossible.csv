,Exploding Bubblegum,"""Fashions fade, style is eternal."" - Yves Laurent Filled with super-slick visuals and impeccable compositions, this big-budget thriller looks better with each passing year. While the 90's action movies of Cameron, Spielberg, Donner, Harlin, the Wachowskis and the Scotts have started to lose their shine, De Palma's exercise in mainstream mayhem ages like fine wine (or maybe just good grape juice).It's all about style, of course. Gloriously wide compositions, extreme close ups, canted angles, split-diopters, whip-pans, point of view shots and four slick set pieces...watching this film is like attending a masterclass in camera movement.De Palma's not just good with surfaces, he's obsessed with them. Villains are dressed in 1950's PI/spy coats, the heist scenes outdo Dassin's ""Riffi"" and Melville's ""Bob The Gambler"", the film is shot in luxurious black and whites and all the while De Palma's camera glides from one perfect composition to the next. To get this kind of fluid camera work, this seamlessness, you'd have to turn to Pixar and their virtual cameras.Of course, the irony is that for a director so obsessed with achieving perfect images, De Palma is constantly reminding us how fallible images are. All his tics and themes are here, albeit in a condensed fashion: truth needing to be reassembled, the unreliability of the image, the camera that lies, voyeurs (the first shot is a close up of a digital screen), conspiracies, false identities, doppelgangers, the need to reconstruct the film's opening murder etc.The only thing missing are some operatic sex scenes, which were actually filmed but deleted when producer Tom Cruise, not wanting to chase away the teen audience, had all romantic scenes with super-lush French actress Emmanuelle Béart removed.Author James Ellroy (sometimes he feels like the only other person on the planet who actually loves De Palma's ""Black Dahlia"") perfectly describes De Palma's style when commenting on the director's adaptation of his novel: ""De Palma's films circumscribe worlds of obsession. They are rigorously and suffocatingly formed. No outer world exists during their time frame. Colors flare oddly. Movement arrests you. You forfeit control and see only what he wants you to see. He manipulates you in the sole name of passion. He understands relinquishment. The film-goer needs to succumb. His films are authoritative. He controls response firmly. His hold tightens as his stories veer into chaos. He stands and falls, coheres and decoheres, succeeds and errs behind passion. He was the ideal artist to film The Black Dahlia."" Later he says: ""Bucky Bleichert is a fictional cop and a doppelganger/writer-filmmaker. He's the man writing out the great adventure of his life and the voyeur viewing sex with a camera. Bleichert is me. Bleichert is De Palma. He's standing outside momentous events. He's lost in scrutiny. He wants to control. He wants to capitulate. His inner life is near chaotic. He needs to impose external order to countermand his mental state. It's Homicide Investigation as Art. He needs to take malignancy and render it something his own."" And then: ""The Black Dahlia spins off the axis of De Palma and Hartnett. It's a three-mode constellation: thriller/noir/historical romance. The design is near-German Expressionist. It's L.A./it's not L.A./it's L.A. seen by Dahlia fiends in extremis. The film commands you to savour every scene and revel in your visual entrapment. This textual richness symbolises the Dahlia's hold on us. We can never look away. She won't let us."" 8/10 – While ""Casualties of War's"" camera shifted stance with each vertical plane (underground, plateau, hill, bridge), here De Palma's camera changes stance when we jump from Prague to London to the Channel Crossing that links them. Complaints about silly plots and actors are valid but inconsequential. This is about De Palma's camera, Tom Cruise a prop that need only turn up and look appropriately intense.Worth three viewings.",exploding bubblegum,fashions fade style is eternal yves laurent filled with super slick visuals impeccable compositions this big budget thriller looks better with each passing year while 90s action movies cameron spielberg donner harlin wachowskis scotts have started lose their shine de palmas exercise mainstream mayhem ages like fine wine or maybe just good grape juice its all about style course gloriously wide compositions extreme close ups canted angles split diopters whip pans point view shots four slick set pieces watching this film is like attending masterclass camera movement de palmas not just good with surfaces hes obsessed with them villains are dressed 1950s pi spy coats heist scenes outdo dassins riffi melvilles bob gambler film is shot luxurious black whites all while de palmas camera glides one perfect composition next get this kind fluid camera work this seamlessness youd have turn pixar their virtual cameras course irony is that director so obsessed with achieving perfect images de palma is constantly reminding us how fallible images are all his tics themes are here albeit condensed fashion truth needing be reassembled unreliability image camera that lies voyeurs first shot is close up digital screen conspiracies false identities doppelgangers need reconstruct films opening murder etc only thing missing are some operatic sex scenes which were actually filmed but deleted when producer tom cruise not wanting chase away teen audience had all romantic scenes with super lush french actress emmanuelle b art removed author james ellroy sometimes he feels like only other person planet who actually loves de palmas black dahlia perfectly describes de palmas style when commenting directors adaptation his novel de palmas films circumscribe worlds obsession they are rigorously suffocatingly formed no outer world exists during their time frame colors flare oddly movement arrests you you forfeit control see only what he wants you see he manipulates you sole name passion he understands relinquishment film goer needs succumb his films are authoritative he controls response firmly his hold tightens as his stories veer into chaos he stands falls coheres decoheres succeeds errs behind passion he was ideal artist film black dahlia later he says bucky bleichert is fictional cop doppelganger writer filmmaker hes man writing out great adventure his life voyeur viewing sex with camera bleichert is me bleichert is de palma hes standing outside momentous events hes lost scrutiny he wants control he wants capitulate his inner life is near chaotic he needs impose external order countermand his mental state its homicide investigation as art he needs take malignancy render it something his own then black dahlia spins off axis de palma hartnett its three mode constellation thriller noir historical romance design is near german expressionist its l its not l its l seen by dahlia fiends extremis film commands you savour every scene revel your visual entrapment this textual richness symbolises dahlias hold us we can never look away she wont let us 8 10 while casualties wars camera shifted stance with each vertical plane underground plateau hill bridge here de palmas camera changes stance when we jump prague london channel crossing that links them complaints about silly plots actors are valid but inconsequential this is about de palmas camera tom cruise prop that need only turn up look appropriately intense worth three viewings,0.45808823529411774,0.12205882352941175,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,"Confusing, But Still Fun To Watch","Here's another film I watched when it came out and then later when the DVD was released and enjoyed both viewings, despite the fact I got ""lost"" several times.

This isn't an easy story to follow but it gets high marks for keeping it interesting despite that problem.The interesting characters, good cinematography, fun James Bond-like gadgets, just the right amount of action scenes and one very memorable heist scene with Tom Cruise dangling from a wire all make this an enjoyable two hours of entertainment. That scene with Cruise trying to break into this vault-like room remains as the one of the better tension-filled scenes I've ever witnessed on the big screen.The final action scene with the speeding train and helicopter also is very memorable.

8.0,Slick and stylish action flick,"Based on the TV show of the same name, Brian De Palma's stylish thriller stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt; a James Bond-esquire secret agent working for a certain section of the government. As the title suggests, many of the scenarios in the film are extremely unlikely; but then again, the film wouldn't be living up to it's title if they weren't. It's one thing to criticise it's stunts for being overblown, but if they weren't, critics would be on it's back and calling it things like 'Mission Possible', so really you've just got to go with it. Brian De Palma makes it easy to just 'go with it' by way of an intriguing plot line, a constant array of high-octane sequences and lots of his trademark style! The plot does get a little too convoluted for it's own good at times, and sometimes it's a little hard to follow; but it gives the film a good basis for all manner of impossibilities, so it serves it's purpose. We follow Ethan Hunt and his team. After a botched mission, Hunt finds himself on the run from his employers after being accused of disloyalty. Hunt must now pull out all the stops to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and get to the bottom of why their mission went wrong.The film features a number of stunts, the best of which sees Tom Cruise breaking into the CIA via the roof. This sequence is brilliantly executed, with De Palma managing to inject bucketloads of suspense into the scene. This scene fits the tone of the film as it's brooding and cerebral, but the film ditches that idea for it's conclusion, which sees a bullet train, a helicopter and the Channel Tunnel combine to great effect! The problem with all these stunts is that the parts between the action sequences aren't all that interesting, and at times can slow the film down to walking pace. This isn't a big problem, however, because there's always more action around every corner and that keeps the film going. Tom Cruise obviously has charisma and can lead a film, but I often find it hard to buy him in action roles. This one suits him, though, as although his character is still more than capable, he comes off as being quite vulnerable, and lucky at times, and that suits Cruise's persona. On the whole, while this isn't a great film; it makes for good entertainment and if that's what you're in the mood for, Mission: Impossible wont disappoint.",slick stylish action flick,based tv show same name brian de palmas stylish thriller stars tom cruise as ethan hunt james bond esquire secret agent working certain section government as title suggests many scenarios film are extremely unlikely but then again film wouldnt be living up its title if they werent its one thing criticise its stunts being overblown but if they werent critics would be its back calling it things like mission possible so really youve just got go with it brian de palma makes it easy just go with it by way intriguing plot line constant array high octane sequences lots his trademark style plot does get little too convoluted its own good at times sometimes its little hard follow but it gives film good basis all manner impossibilities so it serves its purpose we follow ethan hunt his team after botched mission hunt finds himself run his employers after being accused disloyalty hunt must now pull out all stops stay one step ahead his pursuers get bottom why their mission went wrong film features number stunts best which sees tom cruise breaking into cia via roof this sequence is brilliantly executed with de palma managing inject bucketloads suspense into scene this scene fits tone film as its brooding cerebral but film ditches that idea its conclusion which sees bullet train helicopter channel tunnel combine great effect problem with all these stunts is that parts between action sequences arent all that interesting at times can slow film down walking pace this isnt big problem however because theres always more action around every corner that keeps film going tom cruise obviously has charisma can lead film but i often find it hard buy him action roles this one suits him though as although his character is still more than capable he comes off as being quite vulnerable lucky at times that suits cruises persona whole while this isnt great film it makes good entertainment if thats what youre mood mission impossible wont disappoint,0.5223556998556999,0.1684181096681096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.47}"
7.0,It's not Impossible to like this film,"With the trend that began in the early 1990's to adapt old television series into major motion pictures, Mission: Impossible was one of the many added to the list. Premiering in the late 1960's, Mission: Impossible was hit series for CBS for seven seasons and brought actors such as Peter Graves and Martin Landau to popular stardom. In 1996, superstar Tom Cruise collaborated with director Brian de Palma to bring the modern film version to life, and despite some critical drubbing at the time, Mission: Impossible proves to be one of the better television to motion picture adaptations to grace the screen to date.Mission: Impossible, the series, was very much in the same mold of the modern police procedural Law & Order: it was almost exclusively plot driven. Sure, the same characters reappeared episode after episode, but none of them were ever fleshed out or significantly developed. The series was exclusively interested in telling it's tale of a team of U.S. spies using subterfuge, theatrics and make-up to confuse and confound their mark and obtain their goal. With Tom Cruise in the lead of the film version, it seemed unlikely that this format would hold, and while the film does give a little more depth to it's leads, it is still pushed along by the tale more than the people.The film opens in Prague, where the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) have gathered to perform their latest mission: to prevent a double-agent from selling off a list of the secret identities of covert agents operating in Europe. The team is comprised of leader Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), key man Ethan Hunt (Cruise), electronics expert Jack Harmon (Emilio Estevez), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott-Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), and Jim's wife, Claire (Emmauelle Beart). Part way through the mission, things begin to go horribly wrong, and before the night is out, all members of the team except Hunt are killed by an apparent assassin. Hunt contacts the head of his division, Eugene Kittredge (Henry Czerny) and discovers that the whole mission was designed to capture a suspected mole in the agency, and since Hunt was the only one who survived, he is labeled the mole.Hunt escapes capture and is determined to prove his innocence. With the discovery that Claire did not die during the mission, Hunt makes contact with an arms dealer named Max (Vanessa Redgrave) who the real mole was dealing with and makes his own deal: he will secure the information that Max wants if Max promises to deliver the real mole to him. Hunt recruits former members of the IMF who were discovered during previous missions and had to be ""disavowed' by the U.S. These include super hacker Luther Stickle (Ving Rhames) and helicopter pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno). Together, the group plans their heist, but things quickly become complicated and not everything with this whole operation is as it seems.At the time of it's release, Mission: Impossible was criticized for being so complicated as to be undecipherable, and while it is indeed complex, it is not impossibly so. The film does weave a complicated plot and requires the audience's attention, but that is actually one of the film's strengths. It doesn't proceed in an entirely normal manner, hitting all the usual beats you would expect from a Mission: Impossible story, so while it follows the formula to a degree, it also manages to stand that formula on it's head. If the film does fall short, plot wise, it is principally in one area involving a central twist to the story. From the moment the backstory for this twist is introduced early in the film until the plot finally reveals it, there is nothing terribly surprising about it. The final scenes of the film do suggest that it is not what it would seem to be, but even still, the fact that so major a plot element in a film that is supposed to be a suspense thriller is so easily deduced is a bit of a let down.Mission: Impossible is also not an action film in the literal sense. There is one major action set piece, but it is late in the film's running time, and up until then, the film has had no major car chases or fisticuffs. It replaces those with one major sequence of suspense, in which Ethan Hunt must attempt to retrieve information from a computer in a room littered with sensing equipment, including pressure sensitive floors, temperature controls and audio sensors. This sequence, played largely without dialogue and no music, is effective in building tension and literally putting you on the edge of your seat.Mission: Impossible is not really an actor's movie. All the leads, from Cruise on down, are competent and do their jobs well, but nobody really takes hold of your attention. Cruise is his usual suave self, Rhames is entertaining as Luther Stickle, and Reno is appropriately shady as Kreiger. There is the suggestion of a possible romance between Hunt and Claire, but there isn't much chemistry between the two.Mission: Impossible isn't a great film, but it is a good, effective one. It does require the audience pay attention and, emotionally, it doesn't pack a whallop, but it is good summer popcorn entertainment.",its not impossible like this film,with trend that began early 1990s adapt old television series into major motion pictures mission impossible was one many added list premiering late 1960s mission impossible was hit series cbs seven seasons brought actors such as peter graves martin landau popular stardom 1996 superstar tom cruise collaborated with director brian de palma bring modern film version life despite some critical drubbing at time mission impossible proves be one better television motion picture adaptations grace screen date mission impossible series was very much same mold modern police procedural law order it was almost exclusively plot driven sure same characters reappeared episode after episode but none them were ever fleshed out or significantly developed series was exclusively interested telling its tale team u s spies using subterfuge theatrics make up confuse confound their mark obtain their goal with tom cruise lead film version it seemed unlikely that this format would hold while film does give little more depth its leads it is still pushed along by tale more than people film opens prague where impossible missions force imf have gathered perform their latest mission prevent double agent selling off list secret identities covert agents operating europe team is comprised leader jim phelps jon voight key man ethan hunt cruise electronics expert jack harmon emilio estevez sarah davies kristin scott thomas hannah williams ingeborga dapkunaite jims wife claire emmauelle beart part way through mission things begin go horribly wrong before night is out all members team except hunt are killed by apparent assassin hunt contacts head his division eugene kittredge henry czerny discovers that whole mission was designed capture suspected mole agency since hunt was only one who survived he is labeled mole hunt escapes capture is determined prove his innocence with discovery that claire did not die during mission hunt makes contact with arms dealer named max vanessa redgrave who real mole was dealing with makes his own deal he will secure information that max wants if max promises deliver real mole him hunt recruits former members imf who were discovered during previous missions had be disavowed by u s these include super hacker luther stickle ving rhames helicopter pilot franz krieger jean reno together group plans their heist but things quickly become complicated not everything with this whole operation is as it seems at time its release mission impossible was criticized being so complicated as be undecipherable while it is indeed complex it is not impossibly so film does weave complicated plot requires audiences attention but that is actually one films strengths it doesnt proceed entirely normal manner hitting all usual beats you would expect mission impossible story so while it follows formula degree it also manages stand that formula its head if film does fall short plot wise it is principally one area involving central twist story moment backstory this twist is introduced early film until plot finally reveals it there is nothing terribly surprising about it final scenes film do suggest that it is not what it would seem be but even still fact that so major plot element film that is supposed be suspense thriller is so easily deduced is bit let down mission impossible is also not action film literal sense there is one major action set piece but it is late films running time up until then film has had no major car chases or fisticuffs it replaces those with one major sequence suspense which ethan hunt must attempt retrieve information computer room littered with sensing equipment including pressure sensitive floors temperature controls audio sensors this sequence played largely without dialogue no music is effective building tension literally putting you edge your seat mission impossible is not really actors movie all leads cruise down are competent do their jobs well but nobody really takes hold your attention cruise is his usual suave self rhames is entertaining as luther stickle reno is appropriately shady as kreiger there is suggestion possible romance between hunt claire but there isnt much chemistry between two mission impossible isnt great film but it is good effective one it does require audience pay attention emotionally it doesnt pack whallop but it is good summer popcorn entertainment,0.574495341614907,0.03823649930986887,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"

While the other flicks offer plenty of explosions and cool action sequences, the original remains the best for it's interesting plot twists, some decent acting, and a well developed element of suspense that's lacking in the later pictures.To reveal any of the plot would be a disservice: it certainly has some pretty interesting occurrences that should be seen for full effect. What really makes this great though is De Palma's direction. Unlike the later flicks, key scenes are drawn out: there is a real Spense of suspense that is rarely achieved. Three key action scenes come to mind, and there all extremely cool: it's just a shame that Criuse couldn't enlist the services of more experienced director's later in the franchise.A memorable, well executed thriller.",very clever thriller,those who have not seen original mission impossible it is real shame while other flicks offer plenty explosions cool action sequences original remains best its interesting plot twists some decent acting well developed element suspense thats lacking later pictures reveal any plot would be disservice it certainly has some pretty interesting occurrences that should be seen full effect what really makes this great though is de palmas direction unlike later flicks key scenes are drawn out there is real spense suspense that is rarely achieved three key action scenes come mind there all extremely cool its just shame that criuse couldnt enlist services more experienced directors later franchise memorable well executed thriller,0.5359062980030723,0.24696620583717355,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
8.0,Exciting But Nothing Like the TV Series,"The transition that ""Mission Impossible"" made from the small screen to the big screen ignited considerable controversy. The beloved character that Peter Graves originated on television named Jim Phelps became a treacherous rogue agent that Jon Voight played as a villain in the film that director Brian De Palma helmed. Hardcore ""Mission Impossible"" fans have never forgiven either Tom Cruise or Brian De Palma for this sacrilege. The first ""Mission Impossible"" suffers from contrivances galore. Nevertheless, ""Mission Impossible"" emerges as an exciting, suspenseful nail-biter with three electrifying set-pieces: the opening computer heist debacle at an American embassy, the white-knuckled scene in the vault at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and the chilling train ride sequence as the finale that culminates with a helicopter being dragged by a train through the claustrophobic confines of a tunnel. The CIA vault scene ends up being the best, with the other two are slickly done. The story opens with a brief vignette that features American espionage agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise of ""Risky Business"") masquerading as an older, mustached man orchestrating a ruse against an enemy agent by convincing his adversary that he has been instrumental in the death of a young woman. As soon as Hunt extracts the information from his disheveled adversary, they incapacitate him, revive the girl, Claire (Emmanuelle Béart of ""Don Juan""), who is playing possum and tear down the fake motel. The next thing we know we are introduced to the cinematic incarnation of Jim Phelps, and ""Mission Impossible"" adheres slavishly to the television formula with IMF chief Phelps receiving the usual briefing from a disc that self-destructs after he is told about his latest mission should he decide to accept it. Phelps relies on his right hand man, Ethan Hunt, to coordinate the operation in Prague. The IMF is supposed to record the pilfering of the CIA's master list of Eastern Europe spies. During the mission, everything goes haywire, and everybody but Hunt dies. Ultimately, we learn that neither Phelps nor his wife Claire died. The Phelps couple staged their own deaths. Naturally, since Hunt is the last man standing, his CIA superior Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny of ""Ice Castles"") suspects that he may culpable of the crime. The big revelation for Hunt is the discovery that the entire operation was 'a mole hunt' to expose a saboteur. The resourceful Hunt manages to escape from Kittridge when he uses explosive chewing gum to blow up the aquarium restaurant where he met with the CIA chieftain.Holing up in a Prague safe house, Hunt finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place. Eventually, he smokes out an arms dealer, Max (Vanessa Redgrave of ""Blow-Up"") who pays him to steal the spy list. Since he cannot call on his former comrades because they are dead, Hunt enticed disavowed computer specialist Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames of ""Pulp Fiction"") and pilot Franz Krieger (Jean Reno of """"Flyboys"") who can fly a helicopter through anything. The theft of top-secret computer documents from Langley ranks as the best scene in ""Mission Impossible"" with our intrepid hero dangling from a rig in the ceiling to make himself inconspicuous to the vault security gauntlet. Watching Krieger as he uses his muscles to keep Hunt from tripping the security alarms is taut stuff. The exit that they make disguised as firefighters is clever. Like its small screen predecessor, the cinematic ""Mission"" features spectacles that boast built-in TV cameras, hidden microphones, laptop computers, agents in sophisticated covers, exploding cars, exploding chewing gum, stabbings, gunplay, bodies toppling into a river, etc.",exciting but nothing like tv series,transition that mission impossible made small screen big screen ignited considerable controversy beloved character that peter graves originated television named jim phelps became treacherous rogue agent that jon voight played as villain film that director brian de palma helmed hardcore mission impossible fans have never forgiven either tom cruise or brian de palma this sacrilege first mission impossible suffers contrivances galore nevertheless mission impossible emerges as exciting suspenseful nail biter with three electrifying set pieces opening computer heist debacle at american embassy white knuckled scene vault at cia headquarters langley virginia chilling train ride sequence as finale that culminates with helicopter being dragged by train through claustrophobic confines tunnel cia vault scene ends up being best with other two are slickly done story opens with brief vignette that features american espionage agent ethan hunt tom cruise risky business masquerading as older mustached man orchestrating ruse against enemy agent by convincing his adversary that he has been instrumental death young woman as soon as hunt extracts information his disheveled adversary they incapacitate him revive girl claire emmanuelle b art don juan who is playing possum tear down fake motel next thing we know we are introduced cinematic incarnation jim phelps mission impossible adheres slavishly television formula with imf chief phelps receiving usual briefing disc that self destructs after he is told about his latest mission should he decide accept it phelps relies his right hand man ethan hunt coordinate operation prague imf is supposed record pilfering cias master list eastern europe spies during mission everything goes haywire everybody but hunt dies ultimately we learn that neither phelps nor his wife claire died phelps couple staged their own deaths naturally since hunt is last man standing his cia superior eugene kittridge henry czerny ice castles suspects that he may culpable crime big revelation hunt is discovery that entire operation was mole hunt expose saboteur resourceful hunt manages escape kittridge when he uses explosive chewing gum blow up aquarium restaurant where he met with cia chieftain holing up prague safe house hunt finds himself caught between rock hard place eventually he smokes out arms dealer max vanessa redgrave blow up who pays him steal spy list since he cannot call his former comrades because they are dead hunt enticed disavowed computer specialist luther stickell ving rhames pulp fiction pilot franz krieger jean reno flyboys who can fly helicopter through anything theft top secret computer documents langley ranks as best scene mission impossible with our intrepid hero dangling rig ceiling make himself inconspicuous vault security gauntlet watching krieger as he uses his muscles keep hunt tripping security alarms is taut stuff exit that they make disguised as firefighters is clever like its small screen predecessor cinematic mission features spectacles that boast built tv cameras hidden microphones laptop computers agents sophisticated covers exploding cars exploding chewing gum stabbings gunplay bodies toppling into river etc,0.5659018759018758,0.017821067821067824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.44}"
7.0,call it a guilty pleasure,"Every now and again, you will come upon a film that you know really isn't the best movie in the world, or even a particularly good movie on its own. And yet, despite its glaring flaws and imperfectness and lack of completion, you do find yourself strangely attached to it because it has a charm to itself that keeps you interested. Call it a guilty pleasure.Mission: Impossible is my guilty pleasure. It's based on a 1960s television series created by Bruce Geller and the movie with Tom Cruise is kind of like a mash-up between The Bourne Identity and the James Bond pictures. Basically, the standard spy movie. Tom Cruise plays a spy who is falsely accused of betrayal to his organization and finds himself working with some unlikely partners to track down the real mole in the system and expose him and clear his name. Now, this is a plot as old as the hills and Mission: Impossible works with it just as well as the others. Not enormously well, but on an acceptable level.Tom Cruise is great as the film's action hero lead, unfortunately his supporting cast is quite uninteresting. Another defect worth noting is the film's convoluted plot, which sometimes is hard to follow. This is caused by a screenplay in need of revisions. That's one of the film's major weaknesses and really the reason why it's just a standard spy movie with lots of cool gadgets instead of something special.But that's really my only significant complaint about Mission: Impossible. Those rather small, unimportant defects left aside, and leaving the movie to its own devices, it works out well especially in its action sequences. Again, it's all been done before, sometimes better sometimes worse, but that doesn't meant it's boring or overdrawn. In fact, sometimes it's very primal. There is one scene in particular that I found intense and suspenseful on a hair-raising level. The scene goes on for an unremittingly long time, keeping us on the edges of our seats, and the best thing of all is that it's silent. The filmmakers could have chosen to go along with some dark, heavy music or some ominous heartbeat sound effects to put us in the same shoes with the characters, but the fact that it's quiettoo quiet for our likingmakes it so much more compelling. I only wish the rest of the movie was like this scene. Then it really would have been special.Nevertheless, De Palma's Mission: Impossible works out well for what it is and unless you're not a fan of the standard spy movies or action pictures in particular, of if you have your standards and hopes up too high, I imagine you will enjoy it.

7.0,"First thrilling installation of the famous saga with non-stop action , rousing score and spectacular images","Top-notch entry of the Mission Impossible series filled with thrills , twists , turns and lots of action . Mission : Impossible¨ by Brian De Palma boasts a very good cast such as Tom Cruise , Ving Rhames , Jon Voight , Henry Czerny , Kristin Scott Thomas , Vanessa Redgrave Emmanuel Beart , Jean Reno . The undercover unit comes into action with several fine spectacular scenes . The crack undercover agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called into action by IMF staff (John Voight) , his assignment is a crucial mission to prevent the theft of classified material . The outfit formed by stalwarts specialists (Emilio Estevez , Emmanuel Beart , Kristin Scott Thomas) execute a dangerous operation in Praga . But the team is double-crossed and things go wrong , causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go to clear his name . As American agent , under false suspicion of disloyalty ,he must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization . Meanwhile , Ethan and his undercover new bunch (Ving Rhames , Jean Reno) try to discover who set them up . Ethan and his group carry out a dangerous caper at Langley , Virginia , breaking into the CIA's most impenetrable vault . This energetic movie packs unstopped action , hair-raising suspense , exciting thriller , frenetic pursuits and lots of violence . Well made high-tech hijinks and full of breathtaking set-up with impressive frames such as the climactic train sequence that took 6 weeks to film at the 007 stage at Pinewood Studios . And the exterior shots of the train scene, supposedly with the train in France, were mostly shot in Scotland . Tom Cruise performed a lot of sequences where Ethan Hunt executes his risked missions without the use of a stunt double . As during the filming of production , Tom Cruise did the majority of his own stunts including the CIA vault sequences to show the audience it was actually him ; this would allow director Brian De Palma to have more capabilities with camera angles & not having to hide the fact it is a stuntman doing the stunts . When Ethan is suspended by a cable while infiltrating the CIA vault results to be the series trademark , but it is ripped off from ¨Topkapi¨ by Jules Dassin . As it also appears in M.I. 2 (2000) and Mission: Impossible III (2006), Jeremy Renner also did this in Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol . The film contains an interesting as well as twisted story in flamboyant treatment , worth two hours'time, with screenplay and story written by David Koepp , Robert Towne , Steven Zaillian and based on the vintage characters by Bruce Heller . Lalo Schifrin's classic score television is again well reused here , at a much higher decibel level and adding a stirring soundtrack by Danny Elffman , fitting perfectly to action . Fascinating and luxurious cinematography by excellent cameraman by Stephen H. Burum . As usual, Tom Cruise co-executive produced , along with J. C. Calciano , Paul Hitchcock and Paula Wagner . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Brian De Palma . He's a successful producer , writer and director with a lot of hits such as ¨Sisters ¨, ¨Dresssed to Kill¨, ¨Blow out¨ , ¨Obsession¨ : all of them are outwardly odes to Hitchcock ; furthermore , he also made unforgettable flicks : ¨Scarface¨ , ¨Untouchables¨ , ¨Carlito's way¨ , ¨Femme Fatale¨ , ¨The Black Dahlia¨ , among others . ¨MI 1¨ , rating : Better than average and well worth seeing . The tale will appeal to Tom Cruise fans and unstop action movies fans . The film had big success at the box office worldwide , becoming one of the highest-grossing installment in the franchise .Other installments from this popular and successful series are the followings : ¨ ¨Mission : Impossible II¨ by John Woo with Dougray Scott , Thandie Newton , Richard Roxburgh , John Polson , Brendan Gleeson ; ¨MI 3¨ (2006) by J. J. Abrahams with Philip Seymour Hoffman , Ving Rhames , Maggie Q , Jonathan Rhys Meyers and ¨MI 4¨ by Brad Bird with Paula Patton , Simon Pegg , Jeremy Renner , Michael Nyqvist and ¨Mission : Impossible V¨ (2015) by Christopher McQuarrie with Jeremy Renner , Simon Pegg , Ving Rhames , Rebecca Ferguson , Sean Harris , Alec Baldwin and , of course , Tom Cruise",first thrilling installation famous saga with non stop action rousing score spectacular images,top notch entry mission impossible series filled with thrills twists turns lots action mission impossible by brian de palma boasts very good cast such as tom cruise ving rhames jon voight henry czerny kristin scott thomas vanessa redgrave emmanuel beart jean reno undercover unit comes into action with several fine spectacular scenes crack undercover agent ethan hunt tom cruise is called into action by imf staff john voight his assignment is crucial mission prevent theft classified material outfit formed by stalwarts specialists emilio estevez emmanuel beart kristin scott thomas execute dangerous operation praga but team is double crossed things go wrong causing ethan hunt his new team go clear his name as american agent under false suspicion disloyalty he must discover expose real spy without help his organization meanwhile ethan his undercover new bunch ving rhames jean reno try discover who set them up ethan his group carry out dangerous caper at langley virginia breaking into cias most impenetrable vault this energetic movie packs unstopped action hair raising suspense exciting thriller frenetic pursuits lots violence well made high tech hijinks full breathtaking set up with impressive frames such as climactic train sequence that took 6 weeks film at 007 stage at pinewood studios exterior shots train scene supposedly with train france were mostly shot scotland tom cruise performed lot sequences where ethan hunt executes his risked missions without use stunt double as during filming production tom cruise did majority his own stunts including cia vault sequences show audience it was actually him this would allow director brian de palma have more capabilities with camera angles not having hide fact it is stuntman doing stunts when ethan is suspended by cable while infiltrating cia vault results be series trademark but it is ripped off topkapi by jules dassin as it also appears m i 2 2000 mission impossible iii 2006 jeremy renner also did this mission impossible ghost protocol film contains interesting as well as twisted story flamboyant treatment worth two hourstime with screenplay story written by david koepp robert towne steven zaillian based vintage characters by bruce heller lalo schifrins classic score television is again well reused here at much higher decibel level adding stirring soundtrack by danny elffman fitting perfectly action fascinating luxurious cinematography by excellent cameraman by stephen h burum as usual tom cruise co executive produced along with j c calciano paul hitchcock paula wagner motion picture was compellingly directed by brian de palma hes successful producer writer director with lot hits such as sisters dresssed kill blow out obsession all them are outwardly odes hitchcock furthermore he also made unforgettable flicks scarface untouchables carlitos way femme fatale black dahlia among others mi 1 rating better than average well worth seeing tale will appeal tom cruise fans unstop action movies fans film had big success at box office worldwide becoming one highest grossing installment franchise other installments this popular successful series are followings mission impossible ii by john woo with dougray scott thandie newton richard roxburgh john polson brendan gleeson mi 3 2006 by j j abrahams with philip seymour hoffman ving rhames maggie q jonathan rhys meyers mi 4 by brad bird with paula patton simon pegg jeremy renner michael nyqvist mission impossible v 2015 by christopher mcquarrie with jeremy renner simon pegg ving rhames rebecca ferguson sean harris alec baldwin course tom cruise,0.5622641912078534,0.1687942808365344,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8.0,Exciting espionage thriller.,"Mission: Impossible tells the story of wrongly disavowed secret agent Ethan Hunt trying to prevent the theft of a list of all the secret agents in the world with the help of two other disavowed agents played by Ving Rhames and Jean Reno. While all this is going on, he must find the true mole in his agency that set him up.Mission: Impossible is the perfect film for anyone who enjoys a good spy movie. The plot is quick and to the point. It never lets up for a minute. Unfortunately when it comes to spy movies, I'm left stumped with some of the details. With Mission: Impossible, even though they talk about things that are hard for the layman to understand, it can be easily figured out before the end of the film. But who cares anyway? The action scenes are amazing, particularly the famous sequence of Ethan Hunt dangling from a ceiling and catching a sweat droplet so it doesn't trigger the alarm. Since I'm young, I never had the pleasure of watching the TV show, but if it was anything like this movie, I'm sure I'd truly enjoy it.All the roles in the film are played very well. I particularly enjoyed the fact that Ethan Hunt's team is made up of well established actors such as Jon Voight, Emilio Estevez, and Kristen Scott Thomas. You're saying, ""Great cast. This should be good."" Then, without a moments notice, they're all dead in the first 10 minutes.Mission: Impossible is an amazing thrill ride movie, just what you'd expect from the director of Scarface and The Untouchables.8/10",exciting espionage thriller,mission impossible tells story wrongly disavowed secret agent ethan hunt trying prevent theft list all secret agents world with help two other disavowed agents played by ving rhames jean reno while all this is going he must find true mole his agency that set him up mission impossible is perfect film anyone who enjoys good spy movie plot is quick point it never lets up minute unfortunately when it comes spy movies im left stumped with some details with mission impossible even though they talk about things that are hard layman understand it can be easily figured out before end film but who cares anyway action scenes are amazing particularly famous sequence ethan hunt dangling ceiling catching sweat droplet so it doesnt trigger alarm since im young i never had pleasure watching tv show but if it was anything like this movie im sure id truly enjoy it all roles film are played very well i particularly enjoyed fact that ethan hunts team is made up well established actors such as jon voight emilio estevez kristen scott thomas youre saying great cast this should be good then without moments notice theyre all dead first 10 minutes mission impossible is amazing thrill ride movie just what youd expect director scarface untouchables 8 10,0.6803819444444444,0.12135416666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"

6.0,A pretty decent thriller that launched a long-running franchise,"""Mission: Impossible"" is an American 110-minute movie from 1996, so this one is already over 20 years old. The director is Brian De Palma and the lead actor is Tom Cruise, possibly the biggest movie star back then when this film came out and still among the very biggest today, over 2 decades later. This film is based on a television series from several decades earlier, but of course most people don't know about that one, let alone have seen it (or episodes of it) and the movies are much more famous today. I said ""movies"" and this already tells you that several sequels were made and the franchise is still alive today because it keeps getting large crowds into theaters. As for this one here, the cast includes several known names, such as Cruise of course, but also Reno and Rhames are fun to watch. From the older generation, Jon Voight and Vanessa Redgrave are on board. Béart and Scott Thomas (in a pretty small role) play attractive women and Emilio Estevez has an okay cameo too. But all in all, it is really all about Cruise. The film does not offer too much in terms of performances and range really, but it does not have to do so in order to be a success.I think the film manages a good balance overall here. It starts with a real boom that is a crucial event linked to everything that happens afterward, the entire movie, so our attention is right there where it needs to be from the very start. This film is about a lot more than just dealing with the question: Who is the traitor? It is also interesting to follow Cruise's path to finding out the man's identity and that was the real challenge. But still, it was nice to see the coat and the suspense at the end. The train scene (more what happened inside than outside) was truly a highlight here, also with Max and Hunt's aides etc. But it is only the second best scene. The absolute highlight is of course the scene in which they steal all the data, really nerve-racking stuff and so tense that it will inevitable have you at the edge of your seat in its entirety. Certainly a contender for best movie scene of 2016 and I also think the writing there was very good with the temperature, sound sensors etc. This is thriller genre at its very best and judging from this scene alone, the film would have deserved an 8/10 at the very least. But sadly there were also some weaker moments such as the way Reno exits eventually or the plot twist at the end with Béart's character who was not half as memorable as she could have been. And there are others too. But nothing is so grave or bad to a level where it keeps this film from being a really good viewing experience. I highly recommend to check it out, if you are one of the few who haven't already. I myself will check out the sequels at some point in the future as well. Guaranteed. I give this one here, how it all started, a thumbs-up. Go see it.",pretty decent thriller that launched long running franchise,mission impossible is american 110 minute movie 1996 so this one is already over 20 years old director is brian de palma lead actor is tom cruise possibly biggest movie star back then when this film came out still among very biggest today over 2 decades later this film is based television series several decades earlier but course most people dont know about that one let alone have seen it or episodes it movies are much more famous today i said movies this already tells you that several sequels were made franchise is still alive today because it keeps getting large crowds into theaters as this one here cast includes several known names such as cruise course but also reno rhames are fun watch older generation jon voight vanessa redgrave are board b art scott thomas pretty small role play attractive women emilio estevez has okay cameo too but all all it is really all about cruise film does not offer too much terms performances range really but it does not have do so order be success i think film manages good balance overall here it starts with real boom that is crucial event linked everything that happens afterward entire movie so our attention is right there where it needs be very start this film is about lot more than just dealing with question who is traitor it is also interesting follow cruises path finding out mans identity that was real challenge but still it was nice see coat suspense at end train scene more what happened inside than outside was truly highlight here also with max hunts aides etc but it is only second best scene absolute highlight is course scene which they steal all data really nerve racking stuff so tense that it will inevitable have you at edge your seat its entirety certainly contender best movie scene 2016 i also think writing there was very good with temperature sound sensors etc this is thriller genre at its very best judging this scene alone film would have deserved 8 10 at very least but sadly there were also some weaker moments such as way reno exits eventually or plot twist at end with b arts character who was not half as memorable as she could have been there are others too but nothing is so grave or bad level where it keeps this film being really good viewing experience i highly recommend check it out if you are one few who havent already i myself will check out sequels at some point future as well guaranteed i give this one here how it all started thumbs up go see it,0.4646007326007327,0.19093772893772892,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8.0,A tense thriller that is not (despite popular belief) impossible to follow.,"I would like to reiterate what ""Anonymous of Derby, England"" said about this film (20th November). The fact that so many people have complained that they ""didn't get it"" is proof that our brains are being atrophied by so many movies that do all our thinking for us. I had no trouble in following the plot and found the fact that I actually had to concentrate and think things through quite refreshing. Okay, so a lot of the stunts were a bit far fetched but what does it matter when they were so entertaining? After all, it is only a movie; nobody expects us to believe that these things could really happen any more than they expect us to believe that King Kong really existed or that there's a Volcano ready to errupt in L.A. Besides, with the inspired casting of David Schneider as the train driver, Brian de Palma must have had his tongue in his cheek for at least some of the time. He's created a masterful boy's own adventure story, an original ""ripping yarn"" and that brilliant comic touch added to this perfectly.""Mission Impossible"" is a visual and cerebral treat. Tom Cruise is excellent as Ethan, Vanessa Redgrave makes a superb villian and Jean Reno is watchable in ANYTHING he does. The only weak link is Emmanuelle Beart, who did a good job of looking beautiful but very little else. What a shame Kristin Scott Thomas couldn't have taken a more central role; she makes the gorgeous but bland Beart look like a waste of space.I give this 8 out of ten and it would have been more if it wasn't for Beart's character.",tense thriller that is not despite popular belief impossible follow,i would like reiterate what anonymous derby england said about this film 20th november fact that so many people have complained that they didnt get it is proof that our brains are being atrophied by so many movies that do all our thinking us i had no trouble following plot found fact that i actually had concentrate think things through quite refreshing okay so lot stunts were bit far fetched but what does it matter when they were so entertaining after all it is only movie nobody expects us believe that these things could really happen any more than they expect us believe that king kong really existed or that theres volcano ready errupt l besides with inspired casting david schneider as train driver brian de palma must have had his tongue his cheek at least some time hes created masterful boys own adventure story original ripping yarn that brilliant comic touch added this perfectly mission impossible is visual cerebral treat tom cruise is excellent as ethan vanessa redgrave makes superb villian jean reno is watchable anything he does only weak link is emmanuelle beart who did good job looking beautiful but very little else what shame kristin scott thomas couldnt have taken more central role she makes gorgeous but bland beart look like waste space i give this 8 out ten it would have been more if it wasnt bearts character,0.5885658914728681,0.2423934108527132,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10.0,One of my all-time favorite movies!,"This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films of all time! I'll never forget watching this film for the first time with a good buddy of mine, afterward we couldn't stop talking about it and spent a great deal of time explaining plot points to each other. We finally decided that we just had to see it again, so we did and all of our questions were answered and our theories proven correct.The story is nothing less than superb! Every time you think you have the movie figured out they throw you for another loop, but not too much as to get you irritated trying to figure out the plot. This is most definitely a film that deserves at least two viewings before you can truly understand and appreciate the story. The characters are all excellent as well, although I was sad to see Jack Harmen (Emilio Estevez) get killed off so quickly, I liked his character.The cast is extraordinary! Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt perfectly! Jon Voight was the perfect choice for Jim Phelps. Emmanuelle Beart was very good in her role. Henry Czerny was superb as Kittridge. Jean Reno was an excellent addition to the cast. Ving Rhames was a very nice touch and really added a lot to the film. Kristin Scott Thomas was lovely as always, although played a somewhat minor role in the greater scheme of things. Vanessa Redgrave was another nice addition to the cast. And finally, Emilio Estevez (as I mentioned above), played a small role, and played it quite well.I can see why some of the big fans of the show wouldn't like this film due to certain plot points that I can't give away, so if you are a big fan of the show, be forewarned, you may have some issues with the film. Personally, I've never seen a single episode of the old television show, so I had absolutely no frame of reference. Which, I believe, put me in a better position to appreciate the story.I feel that I have to mention the action scenes in this film! SPECTACULAR!!! The scene where Kittridge and Hunt are talking in the restaurant...just AWESOME! The entire last 20 minutes of the film...UNBELIEVABLE!!! The filming, the action, the special effects and stunts alone make this film worth watching (but luckily, there is so much more to appreciate).If you are a fan of Tom Cruise, or just crime/mystery/action films in general, be sure to check this one out (at least twice). This is honestly one of my top 20 films of all time, I truly hope that you will enjoy this film.

8.0,Great movie.,"""Mission: Impossible"", a 1996 film directed by Brian De Palma, is a great film. I do know others have found it jarring with a confusing storyline and I have to somewhat agree. However, there are many other elements which make this a very enjoyable film - first and foremost, I love the cinematography - the tilted angles which shows how chaotic the situation that Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) is put in. Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) expertly plays his mentor in an interesting role. Ving Rhames stars as Luther Stickell (the only other character besides Ethan Hunt who is in all 3 films so far). Emmanuelle Beart as Claire Phelps also makes an appealing love interest. The action sequences are top-notch (especially the helicopter sequence at the end!) and the music is very fitting (by master composer Danny Elfman). I would recommend this film - a high 8 out of 10.",great movie,mission impossible 1996 film directed by brian de palma is great film i do know others have found it jarring with confusing storyline i have somewhat agree however there are many other elements which make this very enjoyable film first foremost i love cinematography tilted angles which shows how chaotic situation that ethan hunt played by tom cruise is put jim phelps played by jon voight expertly plays his mentor interesting role ving rhames stars as luther stickell only other character besides ethan hunt who is all 3 films so far emmanuelle beart as claire phelps also makes appealing love interest action sequences are top notch especially helicopter sequence at end music is very fitting by master composer danny elfman i would recommend this film high 8 out 10,0.6126666666666666,0.2646666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,Soak up Cruise's Charisma,"Yes, there was a time when Tom Cruise was charismatic. Take trashy movies such as Cocktail and Far and Away or great movies like The Firm and A Few Good Men and imagine anyone other than Tom Cruise in the lead role. Hard to do, isn't it? His brash, cocky attitude was once appealing. Now that he feels he's an intelligent spokesman with something to say, he just comes across as an arrogant a**hole. Fortunately, the first MI falls into his earlier stage.This movie would have been just another action flick without Cruise. Sure we have a stellar cast, but did not Mr. Cruise steal every scene? He is perfect in the role of Ethan Hunt, a spy whose whole team is rubbed out in a convoluted cover up at the start. It is up to Ethan to uncover the plot behind the failed mission. The movie is a series of unveiled plot twists that becomes implausible after a while. But that's not the fun behind Mission Impossible. The fun is watching the great action scenes with their suspenseful turns. So much so, we are willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy the ride. And to let ourselves be swept away by Mr. Cruise's undefinable quality to take us there.",soak up cruises charisma,yes there was time when tom cruise was charismatic take trashy movies such as cocktail far away or great movies like firm few good men imagine anyone other than tom cruise lead role hard do isnt it his brash cocky attitude was once appealing now that he feels hes intelligent spokesman with something say he just comes across as arrogant hole fortunately first mi falls into his earlier stage this movie would have been just another action flick without cruise sure we have stellar cast but did not mr cruise steal every scene he is perfect role ethan hunt spy whose whole team is rubbed out convoluted cover up at start it is up ethan uncover plot behind failed mission movie is series unveiled plot twists that becomes implausible after while but thats not fun behind mission impossible fun is watching great action scenes with their suspenseful turns so much so we are willing suspend disbelief enjoy ride let ourselves be swept away by mr cruises undefinable quality take us there,0.5730902777777777,0.13802083333333337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,"A clever, tense and fun summer thriller","The Mission: Impossible team is headed by Jim Phelps with point man Ethan Hunt. On one mission his whole team is wiped out in front of his eyes leaving him to only survivor. When he reaches his extraction point he finds that his ultimate boss, Kittridge is already in the town and that this mission was a mole hunt to discover who within Phelps's IMF team is a mole. Since Hunt is the only survivor they suspect him and he is forced on the run to discover the real mole. Using other disavowed agents Hunt contacts the mysterious Max and agrees a daring robbery of files from the CIA in order to set a trap for the mole.Brian De Palma's film version was rushed on us in a wave of hype  the theme song itself sets the pulse racing a little quicker. The film needed to stand up to scrutiny. Happily the plot is good enough to get through the film. It is complex but is full of holes at times  but it is enough to stop this being a dumb action movie. Instead it is well set up and has some nice twists and turns along the way.De Palma's direction is good. While he usually is strong in the big set pieces here he manages to do well with them and with the smaller tense settings. The sets are always good and the whole film has a good feel to it. The action scenes only resort to flashy OTT effects towards the end and the most of it is much better tense operations which are much more enjoyable.Although the film isn't great it's clever enough and enjoyable enough to rise above the level of the usual summer movie. Cruise is really good here  all charm, smiles and determination. Rhames is always good value  as is Reno. In fact the whole cast do well and hold some pleasant surprises such as a very flirty Vanessa Redgrave.The weakness of this film is in the marketing  in the original trailer we are shown the money shot of the film. Why?! It was annoying the first time I saw it to see that I'd already seen `the end' months before it had come out! But this is a minor complaint.Overall this isn't a classic but it feels very slick and has a pretty good plot. De Palma's direction is strong whether it be the slanting angles of Hunt's confrontation with Kittridge or the tense robbery of the CIA and the action scenes are worth watching.

7.0,Not really THAT confusing,"I first saw Mission: Impossible when I was 15 and I didn't have a Scooby what the hell was going on. And I considered myself to be smarter than the average bear. In retrospect, it's not that muddled. In comparison to the very-dumbed down sequel it stands out as a better example of film-making made by a director who doesn't underestimate the audience.Brian De Palma is known to be a wildly inconsistent filmmaker. From the over-rated Carrie, to the under-rated Snake Eyes, the classic Untouchables and the downright hideous Mission to Mars and Scarface, he's been through just about everything. But Mission: Impossible was his first true mega-hit. Movies from TV shows are a dime a dozen these days and are rarely taken seriously, I mean look at trash like S.W.A.T. or Dukes of Hazard, but M:I is actually supposed to be a continuation of the show, rather than a spin-off.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt (no, not cockney rhyming slang) an IMF agent who's entire team is killed in a phony sting operation in Prague. Accused of being a traitor he legs it before they can nab him and assembles a team of rogue operatives to find out who the REAL traitor is. Many double-crosses and double-double crosses ensue.For those who cannot follow the plot there are some really good set-pieces with enough tension and excitement to carry the whole movie. You'll know by now the dangling scene in the top-secret room but the best scene in the movie is the high-speed train rocketing through the English countryside. While other directors might use this as a chance to show off, De Palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler.Parts of the movie may seem a bit dated now and it's weird seeing Tom Cruise look like a little boy even though he was already 33. He even sounds different. And what kind of supervillian uses floppy discs? They could have tried something a bit more high-tech there.The M:I franchise could be a helluva lot better, I suppose. The second film was terrible and the third merely average. But they're still better than the last few Bond outings, though it ain't quite up to the rugged quality of the Jason Bourne movies.At least it got off to a good start. But can the world tolerate Cruise long enough to ever get a fourth made?",not really that confusing,i first saw mission impossible when i was 15 i didnt have scooby what hell was going i considered myself be smarter than average bear retrospect its not that muddled comparison very dumbed down sequel it stands out as better example film making made by director who doesnt underestimate audience brian de palma is known be wildly inconsistent filmmaker over rated carrie under rated snake eyes classic untouchables downright hideous mission mars scarface hes been through just about everything but mission impossible was his first true mega hit movies tv shows are dime dozen these days are rarely taken seriously i mean look at trash like s w t or dukes hazard but m i is actually supposed be continuation show rather than spin off tom cruise is ethan hunt no not cockney rhyming slang imf agent whos entire team is killed phony sting operation prague accused being traitor he legs it before they can nab him assembles team rogue operatives find out who real traitor is many double crosses double double crosses ensue those who cannot follow plot there are some really good set pieces with enough tension excitement carry whole movie youll know by now dangling scene top secret room but best scene movie is high speed train rocketing through english countryside while other directors might use this as chance show off de palma keeps it as realistic as possible which makes it infinitely more cooler parts movie may seem bit dated now its weird seeing tom cruise look like little boy even though he was already 33 he even sounds different what kind supervillian uses floppy discs they could have tried something bit more high tech there m i franchise could be helluva lot better i suppose second film was terrible third merely average but theyre still better than last few bond outings though it aint quite up rugged quality jason bourne movies at least it got off good start but can world tolerate cruise long enough ever get fourth made,0.43221707818930033,0.06554526748971193,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,"As good as a spy thriller can get,a real thrill ride to say the least!.","Mission Impossible was a film that I initially didn't care for,during my 1st few viewings. But the latest viewing,it seems I finally got it. Mission Impossible is a film that you have to pay strict attention too,otherwise you will eventually get lost,as it's a very confusing film. It isn't action packed like the sequels are,it's more of a mystery type thriller,but it has plenty of suspense,plenty of surprises,with an explosive finale that will have you on the edge of your seat!. I especially liked the train sequence at the end,it was very well done. I thought the casting of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt was a bit strange at 1st. Now I am a huge Cruise fan,but he just didn't seem like the Action hero type. He proved me wrong big time,and did what he did best,put on a captivating show,his charisma is a big reason this film worked. The big twist at the end is shocking to say the least. Some would say it didn't make much sense,I personally thought it was a nice touch,because the film needed to end with a big bang,and I thought it did just that!.Mission Impossible isn't as flashy or action packed as the sequels,but as far as i'm concerned it may very well be the best in the series.Performances. Tom Cruise has proved to be one of Hollywood's most charismatic and reliable actors for what seems like forever. Here he does not disappoint. He makes a great Ethah Hunt,he's witty,he oozes charisma,adding the perfect balance of charm&likability to Ethan. He handles himself well in the action scenes too,as I said he was a big reason in making this film work,with his undeniable charisma. Jon Voight is a hell of a presence. He always adds class and excellent acting to any film he's in,here was no different. Emmanuelle Béart is certainly a beauty,but she can also act pretty good too. She was highly mysterious,it kept her character unpredictable. Henry Czerny is full of intensity. His banter with Cruise in the restaurant was chilling stuff,I loved the guy!. Jean Reno is OK here. He is a capable actor,but I didn't much care for him in this. Ving Rhames is a pure bad ass,and while his role isn't as big as in the next two,he still came through. Rest of the cast do fine.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible is an excellent spy thriller. It's exciting,suspenseful and downright unpredictable. Highly recommend,if you choose to accept this Mission.8 1/2 /10",as good as spy thriller can get real thrill ride say least,mission impossible was film that i initially didnt care during my 1st few viewings but latest viewing it seems i finally got it mission impossible is film that you have pay strict attention too otherwise you will eventually get lost as its very confusing film it isnt action packed like sequels are its more mystery type thriller but it has plenty suspense plenty surprises with explosive finale that will have you edge your seat i especially liked train sequence at end it was very well done i thought casting tom cruise as ethan hunt was bit strange at 1st now i am huge cruise fan but he just didnt seem like action hero type he proved me wrong big time did what he did best put captivating show his charisma is big reason this film worked big twist at end is shocking say least some would say it didnt make much sense i personally thought it was nice touch because film needed end with big bang i thought it did just that mission impossible isnt as flashy or action packed as sequels but as far as im concerned it may very well be best series performances tom cruise has proved be one hollywoods most charismatic reliable actors what seems like forever here he does not disappoint he makes great ethah hunt hes witty he oozes charisma adding perfect balance charm likability ethan he handles himself well action scenes too as i said he was big reason making this film work with his undeniable charisma jon voight is hell presence he always adds class excellent acting any film hes here was no different emmanuelle b art is certainly beauty but she can also act pretty good too she was highly mysterious it kept her character unpredictable henry czerny is full intensity his banter with cruise restaurant was chilling stuff i loved guy jean reno is ok here he is capable actor but i didnt much care him this ving rhames is pure bad ass while his role isnt as big as next two he still came through rest cast do fine bottom line mission impossible is excellent spy thriller its exciting suspenseful downright unpredictable highly recommend if you choose accept this mission 8 1 2 10,0.5654131652661065,0.13772408963585434,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.26}"

7.0,convoluted story but I don't care,"Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is a secret IMF agent. His team has been infiltrated by a mole. When they go on their new mission, all are wiped out except for Ethan. The mission was actually a mole hunt, and the agency now thinks that sole survivor Ethan is the mole. He must fight to clear his name, and find the real mole.Director Brian De Palma has built an intense convoluted story. He tells an intriguing behind-the-scene story of the two writers writing competing scripts while the movie is in production. It's best not to think too hard and the movie doesn't really give you time to think. The clues, the new characters, and the action keeps coming without easy explanations. Tom Cruise is such a powerful presence that I don't actually question the story. I just enjoy the slick spy story. The action is fast and stylish.
