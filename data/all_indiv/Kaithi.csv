7,An action thriller with heart! [+68%],"It's fairly impossible to craft an action-thriller suited to the Tamil sensibilities without acknowledging its audience. Lokesh Kanagaraj does a pretty amazing job of staying true to the pure action genre in Kaithi. It's that action thriller with a lot of heart. As we saw in Kanagaraj's earlier venture Maanagaram, Kaithi too has interweaving storylines. But the treatment is what renders it engaging throughout. It's a long film (153 minutes or so) yes, but the story moves at such a rapid pace that the audience remains consistently hooked. To put it across in a funny way, Kaithi is the kind of film where there's so much happening at breakneck speed that a viewer who's about to open the lid of a water bottle to hydrate himself/herself may hold back from doing so, till the end of another elaborate set-piece.And when we talk about set-pieces, their crafting is stunning (though exaggerated at times). Anbariv is the man behind these well-thought-out sequences that often raise the levels of adrenaline in the audience. Sathyan Sooryan (the DOP of Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru) handles the cinematography - Kaithi has been shot entirely in the night (except for the last few frames) and yet, everything that unravels in artificial light looks good on screen. The background score by Sam CS definitely ups the style element of the film, and it's one soundtrack you'll want to check up on YouTube or SoundCloud immediately once you're done watching.There are no songs or sappy romances in Kaithi - well, that's how an action thriller ought to be. I appreciate Kanagaraj for doing away with these unnecessary commercial elements, even when there are numerous 'invincible mass hero' moments. It's wonderful how Kanagaraj has given emphasis to characters other than that of Karthi's Dilli. George Maryan, who is relegated to comical roles in most films, gets a meaty character with a fair bit of action - he does a brilliantly memorable job of it! Narain, whom we're seeing in movies after a while, is wonderfully restrained and lets Karthi shine in the scenes that are for the whistling fans. Dheena offers some comic relief in the form of pop-culture references and lightens the tone of the otherwise serious flick.At the core, there's also a story about a father who's travelling to meet his daughter for the first time. While this amps up the sentimental quotient, certain scenes such as the one featuring the crushed earrings, could have been written better (or completely subverted). There isn't any suspense as the important twisty bits are given away in the opening (half) itself, but Kanagaraj's packaging works wonders here. The action bits are strongly done, and that's a more-than-good reason to watch Kaithi. Well, how often do you see a lungi-clad hero using a Gatling gun?",action thriller with heart,its fairly impossible craft action thriller suited tamil sensibilities without acknowledging its audience lokesh kanagaraj does pretty amazing job staying true pure action genre kaithi its that action thriller with lot heart as we saw kanagarajs earlier venture maanagaram kaithi too has interweaving storylines but treatment is what renders it engaging throughout its long film 153 minutes or so yes but story moves at such rapid pace that audience remains consistently hooked put it across funny way kaithi is kind film where theres so much happening at breakneck speed that viewer whos about open lid water bottle hydrate himself herself may hold back doing so till end another elaborate set piece when we talk about set pieces their crafting is stunning though exaggerated at times anbariv is man behind these well thought out sequences that often raise levels adrenaline audience sathyan sooryan dop theeran adhigaaram ondru handles cinematography kaithi has been shot entirely night except last few frames yet everything that unravels artificial light looks good screen background score by sam cs definitely ups style element film its one soundtrack youll want check up youtube or soundcloud immediately once youre done watching there are no songs or sappy romances kaithi well thats how action thriller ought be i appreciate kanagaraj doing away with these unnecessary commercial elements even when there are numerous invincible mass hero moments its wonderful how kanagaraj has given emphasis characters other than that karthis dilli george maryan who is relegated comical roles most films gets meaty character with fair bit action he does brilliantly memorable job it narain whom were seeing movies after while is wonderfully restrained lets karthi shine scenes that are whistling fans dheena offers some comic relief form pop culture references lightens tone otherwise serious flick at core theres also story about father whos travelling meet his daughter first time while this amps up sentimental quotient certain scenes such as one featuring crushed earrings could have been written better or completely subverted there isnt any suspense as important twisty bits are given away opening half itself but kanagarajs packaging works wonders here action bits are strongly done thats more than good reason watch kaithi well how often do you see lungi clad hero using gatling gun,0.547208538587849,0.16845238095238096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.43}"

Finally, I have got to see it and everything said about it is true. It keeps you glued on the seat from start to finish.

Special mention goes to that police constable character who can be called as the second hero of the film. Tamil cinema is famous for family sentiments. Kaithi too has a daughter sentiment and it was very touching. Kudos to karthi and the child. And finally the action sequences. Though unrealistic and bit over the top it was very powerful.
