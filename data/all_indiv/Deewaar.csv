7.0,A moral commentary; Bachchan shines in a realistic performance,"Indeed, a Yash Chopra classic with style and substance. Scripted by Salim-Javed, who tasted great success that year with another classic, Sholay. Deewar is more meaningful than Sholay, but less entertaining, although both films are very good. Yash Chopra is the director of this film, and what can one expect from a director at the top of his game. Deewar is actually not very original, and in general it's a remake of Ganga Jamuna starring Dilip Kumar. That said, Chopra infuses it with a certain energy which makes for a film that tugs at the heartstrings and remains credible despite being derivative. The dialogue is very strong (obviously some of it is trademark today), the development is very good, and technically the film is better than the usual fare with some excellent camera work, and better handling of the action scenes although it's not perfect.Where Chopra scores the most is in the portrayal of the relationships which is done in a most realistic and matter-of-fact way even within the limitations of commercial film. The relationship between Bachchan and Parveen Babi is amazingly authentic and believable, and so is Shashi Kapoor's with Neetu Singh. The ideological differences between the brothers is given utmost importance obviously, and it's done well. Needless to say, Bachchan gets a role he became most associated with, and he is remarkably real. He creates a stylish, restrained persona but adds a great deal of depth and layering to it. Shashi Kapoor supports exceedingly well, with their scenes together highlighted well, and Nirupa Roy is a good driving force. The ladies, Babi and Singh, are natural, and Babi in particular presents a moving act. Deewar is an interesting moral commentary.",moral commentary bachchan shines realistic performance,indeed yash chopra classic with style substance scripted by salim javed who tasted great success that year with another classic sholay deewar is more meaningful than sholay but less entertaining although both films are very good yash chopra is director this film what can one expect director at top his game deewar is actually not very original general its remake ganga jamuna starring dilip kumar that said chopra infuses it with certain energy which makes film that tugs at heartstrings remains credible despite being derivative dialogue is very strong obviously some it is trademark today development is very good technically film is better than usual fare with some excellent camera work better handling action scenes although its not perfect where chopra scores most is portrayal relationships which is done most realistic matter fact way even within limitations commercial film relationship between bachchan parveen babi is amazingly authentic believable so is shashi kapoors with neetu singh ideological differences between brothers is given utmost importance obviously its done well needless say bachchan gets role he became most associated with he is remarkably real he creates stylish restrained persona but adds great deal depth layering it shashi kapoor supports exceedingly well with their scenes together highlighted well nirupa roy is good driving force ladies babi singh are natural babi particular presents moving act deewar is interesting moral commentary,0.5059036796536797,0.2800121753246753,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.23}"

10.0,Comment on earlier comment,"Younger audiences (and especially newcomers) introduced to Hindi cinema by the stars of the 1990s must often secretly wonder why Amitabh Bachchan is such a big deal. He has never had the bulging biceps and ripped body of a Hrithik Roshan. Even in his early films, he couldn't dance nearly as well as Shahrukh. Few of his movies offered elaborate song and dance numbers like those favored today. Sure, he might have turned in some first-rate performances  most recently, in films like Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham and Baghban  but nothing about him seems to *quite* justify his status as superstar-of-the-millennium. Right? If you muse upon these questions but are afraid to address them to your esteemed elders (Bachchan groupies all), then I have the answer for you: Go rent Deewaar.Every once in several decades comes a movie that breaks all the norms and still manages to become not only a runaway success but also an established classic. Deewaar is one such movie. Thirty years after its release, Deewaar remains one of the most famous movies Bollywood has ever produced. Those who love Hindi cinema for its extravagant song and dance routines, its mix of romance, comedy, action and melodrama, and its over-the-top emoting may be surprised to learn that this 1975 explosion-of-a-movie is conspicuously devoid of such characteristic elements. Yet Deewaar is certainly a mainstream Bollywood film. It just happens to be a phenomenal one.Deewaar begins with a terrible choice: in order to save his family's lives, Anand Verma (Satyen Kappu), the union leader of the local mine workers, betrays his constituency, surrendering to the mine-owners' extortionate demands. In return, he is humiliated and ostracized by his community. Unable to bear the shame, Anand absconds, leaving his wife, Sumitra Devi (Nirupa Roy), and his two sons, Vijay (Master Alankar, Amitabh Bachchan) and Ravi (Master Raju, Shashi Kapoor), to fend for themselves.Ravi, the youngest child, largely escapes the backlash, sheltered from the community by his mother and brother. Vijay, on the other hand, bears the brunt of the trauma; he becomes the target of brutal public humiliation. The consequences of Vijay and Ravi's very different experiences only intensify as the brothers grow up. In a desperate bid to give his mother the material comforts he thinks are her due, Vijay takes to a life of crime. In contrast, Ravi, disgusted by repeated rejections in a job market powered by nepotism, decides to enroll in the police force. Inevitably, the siblings' differing ideologies lead to an epic moral clash that creates a ""deewaar,"" or wall, between them. This wall becomes insurmountable when Vijay's mother refuses to accept his ill-gotten riches, and forsakes him to live with Ravi. Ultimately, Vijay's misery compels him to seek redemption, but his attempt to obliterate the wall dividing his family will exact an unthinkable price.Deewaar is, in one word, taut. From start to end, the movie is unrelentingly tense, tight, somber and serious but the seriousness of the film works for two vital reasons: the absolutely amazing, scorching and explosive under-acting by Amitabh Bachchan; and the screenplay and dialogs by Salim-Javed.To say that Amitabh has acted really well in Deewaar is like saying Niagara Falls is a really big waterfall: it misses the enormity of the fact by several million gallons. To lovers of true cinematic acting (and yes, there are some such fans even in Bollywood), Deewaar offers a true, unadulterated, powerhouse performance unparalleled in Hindi cinema. There is no living (or dead, for that matter) actor who could have performed some of Deewaar's most muted and yet powerfully moving scenes -- scenes in which Vijay's silent anguish abruptly transmutes to violent eruptions, literally burning up the screen with intensity, anger, brutality, vulnerability and gritty resolve. To the small but fiercely loyal group of Amitabh fans, Deewaar is and will always be his best performance. To some of us, it defines the gold standard in Hindi film acting. It is Amitabh and only Amitabh who turned this movie from a typical over-the-top melodrama with great dialogs but no good songs into a gripping three-hour experience that leaves the audience mesmerized (and in an overwhelming majority of cases, crying uncontrollably as the end credits roll).As for Salim-Javed...apart from developing what is arguably the tightest script ever written for Hindi film, the pair should have gotten an award for the sheer number of quotable lines in Deewaar. Salim-Javed's script was also daring detour from the mainstream in more ways than one. Consider the oddities. The leading man has no songs in the movie. There is absolutely no comedy - no Johnny Lever or Asrani anywhere in sight. Meanwhile, the leading lady (played convincingly by Parveen Babi) is a hooker, who -- as the narrative explicitly insists -- has sexual relations with the hero. True, both characters' occupations entailed a set of moral values that are less-than-perfect by Indian middle-class standards, but the screenwriters still took an enormous risk by depicting some pretty bold scenes . Yet the power of the script was such that in the end, audiences were rooting for both characters with great sympathy and support. Finally, the leading man is an atheist (albeit superstitious). Not only that, one of the now-famous temple scenes has Amitabh clearly defiant and contemptuous towards God. Quite an audacious step, considering modern heroes are always shown to be terribly pious and god-fearing.Finally, the most significant evidence of Deewaar's superiority is the fact that unlike other hit movies like Sholay and more recent ones like DDLJ, no one has ever dared to copy it. It is the one film whose magic other film-makers realized could not be duplicated. The confluence of extraordinary acting and a uniquely brilliant script cannot be converted into a formula and regenerated ad nauseum. In the end, that may be the biggest tribute Hindi cinema can pay to this all-time, genuinely inimitable classic.",comment earlier comment,younger audiences especially newcomers introduced hindi cinema

10.0,One of the Best Amitabh Movies..GREAT,"Most Critics say Sholay is the best film of all time, Deewar was released in the same year. Instead of Sholay winning all the awards it was Deewar. Deewar won almost every single award in the 1975 Filmfare Awards. Amitabh in yet another Powerhouse performance playing the very serious and disturbed angry man who went through a bizarre incident when he was young that causes him anger through out the film. Shashi Kapoor was impressive as the confused brother. Nirupa Roy is Fantastic in almost every film alongside Amitabh. Nirupa is popular in India known as Amitabhs Mother, since they have made many films together. The Late Nirupa Roy gives a Magnificent Performance as the mother who goes through hardship and dilemma.

8.0,Another great performance from Amitabh Bachchan,"Amitabh Bachchan plays Vijay Verma, brother of a righteous police officer, who comes to resent society for the suffering it has brought upon his mother (and himself). After his dad abandons the family, Vijay and his Mum have to work like slaves to earn a little money to send brother Ravi to school. Ravi becomes a top student and joins the police as a top officer. Meanwhile, Vijay becomes increasingly bitter about the indignities inflicted by him & his mother because they are poor. When he gets a chance to earn some more money he can't say no, even though it involves working for a known smuggler. He quickly rises to become the smuggler's right hand man and becomes rather wealthy as a result. But Vijay's new career creates a rift with his brother that inevitably leads to conflict... but of course it's poor mum that suffers the most.Deewar was made close to the start of the Amitabh Bachchan phenomenon, and contributed no small amount to it. His performance as the angry young man who drifts to the wrong side of the tracks is brilliant - balancing turbulent fury with his charisma and cool.Yash Chopra and writer Salim Javed flood the movie with huge amounts of melodrama (not especially unusual in Bollywood), but take to extremes some things and scenes that would have been better left a little more subtle. The movie is quite complex and layered - something much easier to accomplish when you have 3 hours to explore and develop things, as with most Bollywood movies. The excess of melodrama becomes quite draining over such a length of time though.Quite a good movie, but definitely not as much fun as other Amitabh/Salim Javed pairings such as SHOLAY, SHAAN and the inimitable DON.",another great performance amitabh bachchan,amitabh bachchan plays vijay verma brother righteous police officer who comes resent society suffering it has brought upon his mother himself after his dad abandons family vijay his mum have work like slaves earn little money send brother ravi school ravi becomes top student joins police as top officer meanwhile vijay becomes increasingly bitter about indignities inflicted by him his mother because they are poor when he gets chance earn some more money he cant say no even though it involves working known smuggler he quickly rises become smugglers right hand man becomes rather wealthy as result but vijays new career creates rift with his brother that inevitably leads conflict but course its poor mum that suffers most deewar was made close start amitabh bachchan phenomenon contributed no small amount it his performance as angry young man who drifts wrong side tracks is brilliant balancing turbulent fury with his charisma cool yash chopra writer salim javed flood movie with huge amounts melodrama not especially unusual bollywood but take extremes some things scenes that would have been better left little more subtle movie is quite complex layered something much easier accomplish when you have 3 hours explore develop things as with most bollywood movies excess melodrama becomes quite draining over such length time though quite good movie but definitely not as much fun as other amitabh salim javed pairings such as sholay shaan inimitable don,0.5411910457963088,0.10255468215994532,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,One Of The Best Ever!!,"Released in 1975 after ""Sholay"" and at a time when the then Indian Prime Minister, the late Mrs. Indira Gandhi, declared a National state of Emergency, this was written by the famous duo writers Salim - Javed, who were said to be partly inspired by the real life smuggler, Haji Mastan.Vijay an Ravi, two brothers react differently about their childhood humiliation after their father is wrongfully accused of being a thief - he is a union leader who fights for the rights of his men but succumbs to demands when is shown photographs of his family being kidnapped by the boss of the company.

10.0,Deewar the best. Amitabh the best,"Today i saw DEEWAR(1975) for the third time this year(2006).I have seen this movie about ten time or so but this is one film which is a standard one...a film worth wasting 3 hours. Mr.Amitabh Bachchan clearly showed his power in the movie. The ease with which he turned from a coolie to an underworld don...oh my god!Its completely amazing and admirable! He proved that he is better than the best!His performance was breath-taking....spellbinding...amazing...wonderful...outstanding!The world searches for words to describe this man!Vijay Verma{AB} was a man who loved him mother too deeply...and his love for his mother forced him to do bad deeds.He was the one who suffered the injustice of the society. He skips studies and goes to work in the footpaths as a child to help his mother and make his younger brother study and achieve his goals.He grows into a coolie and his younger brother Ravi Verna ( Shashi Kapoor) grows into a graduated man seeking a job.At that time, Vijay gets into a fight with some goons of an underworld don seeing the injustice shown to a poor worker by the latter which results in the worker's death. Vijay beats them all and his name spreads among the other workers. He is called by another don-Daawar to help him carry out the smuggling businesses. Vijay, In order to wipe away the tears of his mother and to give her a good life, agrees to the the job. He soon becomes the Saviour of the gang and is the head in a short time. At this time,Ravi becomes a police officer who is very true at his work He soon finds out that his brother made all his wealth through smuggling He and his mother leave the house of vi-jay, breaking the poor man's heart. The movie also has Parveen Babi, Neetu singh pairing opposite Amitabh and Shashi respectively. The film ends with Vijay being shot dead by his own brother.That Scene is considered the best in the movie-The scene where Vijay dies on the lap of his mother.Mr.Bachchan's acting was fabulous in the movie....the scene is a clear cut example for it. Most of the other scenes too are awesome. Some of the best are : 1:First and formost, the last scene when Amitabh dies in lap of Nirupa Roy{who portrays his mother}...clearly the best scene...Amitabh's acting make you awe him!!! 2:Ravi confronting Vijay and asking him to sign the paper confessing his underworld connections. Great scene and superb dialog!!! 3:Parveen asking Amitabh to do plastic surgery and remove the writing in his hand that his father is a thief. The intensity of AB'S eyes in that scene...worth a standing ovation!!! 4:The scene when Vijay says ""I have mansion, money...blah blah...what do you have ?"" to Ravi and Ravi answering ""I have mother!"" and the expression on Amitabh face...superb dialog and so well enacted!!! 5:The scene when Amitabh becomes the head of the gang and he sits in the seat of Daavar and places his legs on the table...the look on his face-Triumph, anguish, win after such suffering!!! The number of good scenes go on and on,....In fact Deewaar is a film which has just too many good points!!! The film is very well directed and the plot rocks. And the script and dialogs too are wonderful!!! The performances were spellbinding especially the Big B's He portrayed the Vijay so well that, people bow their heads to this great actor who is brimming with talent. Shashi capo ably supported amitabh and he truly deserves the award for the best actor in a supporting role which he got.But the fact remains that he is overshadowed by Amitabh's powerhouse performance. Though Vijay has done many wrongs, you still get to love him. Its all credit to Amitabh for that. In short this film is a legend...a classic...a wonder of a movie! A must watch...with Amitabh at his best!Deewaar and Sholay which released in the same year are the biggest hits of Amitabh...and deservingly so!!!",deewar best amitabh best,today i saw deewar 1975 third time this year 2006 i have seen this movie about ten time or so but this is one film which is standard one film worth wasting 3 hours mr amitabh bachchan clearly showed his power movie ease with which he turned coolie underworld don oh my god its completely amazing admirable he proved that he is better than best his performance was breath taking spellbinding amazing wonderful outstanding world searches words describe this man vijay verma ab was man who loved him mother too deeply his love his mother forced him do bad deeds he was one who suffered injustice society he skips studies goes work footpaths as child help his mother make his younger brother study achieve his goals he grows into coolie his younger brother ravi verna shashi kapoor grows into graduated man seeking job at that time vijay gets into fight with some goons underworld don seeing injustice shown poor worker by latter which results workers death vijay beats them all his name spreads among other workers he is called by another don daawar help him carry out smuggling businesses vijay order wipe away tears his mother give her good life agrees job he soon becomes saviour gang is head short time at this time ravi becomes police officer who is very true at his work he soon finds out that his brother made all his wealth through smuggling he his mother leave house vi jay breaking poor mans heart movie also has parveen babi neetu singh pairing opposite amitabh shashi respectively film ends with vijay being shot dead by his own brother that scene is considered best movie scene where vijay dies lap his mother mr bachchans acting was fabulous movie scene is clear cut example it most other scenes too are awesome some best are 1 first formost last scene when amitabh dies lap nirupa roy who portrays his mother clearly best scene amitabhs acting make you awe him 2 ravi confronting vijay asking him sign paper confessing his underworld connections great scene superb dialog 3 parveen asking amitabh do plastic surgery remove writing his hand that his father is thief intensity abs eyes that scene worth standing ovation 4 scene when vijay says i have mansion money blah blah what do you have ravi ravi answering i have mother expression amitabh face superb dialog so well enacted 5 scene when amitabh becomes head gang he sits seat daavar places his legs table look his face triumph anguish win after such suffering number good scenes go fact deewaar is film which has just too many good points film is very well directed plot rocks script dialogs too are wonderful performances were spellbinding especially big bs he portrayed vijay so well that people bow their heads this great actor who is brimming with talent shashi capo ably supported amitabh he truly deserves award best actor supporting role which he got but fact remains that he is overshadowed by amitabhs powerhouse performance though vijay has done many wrongs you still get love him its all credit amitabh that short this film is legend classic wonder movie must watch with amitabh at his best deewaar sholay which released same year are biggest hits amitabh deservingly so,0.4434848484848486,0.37684343434343437,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"

I doubt anybody could make such a movie in future or anybody could act like Amitabh, God of Indian Cinema.Loosely based on Haji Mastan's life, this movie portrays the life of Vijay from a dockyard worker to an underworld don. Legend is Amitabh Bachchan met Haji Mastan in a race course in Bombay before the shooting of Deewar started. He saw the moist eyes of Haji Mastan and was quite impressed with them.

,An Amazing Movie,"One of Amitabh's finest work. The raging emotion contained just underneath his skin is kept quietly hidden from the world, with bits boiling over at key moments in the film. He also has great one-liners which became main-stays in the Indian cinema for decades afterward.Shashi was a complete clown in this movie, and you have to ask yourself; what brother would take up arms against his own brother to uphold 'justice', especially in India, the land of corruption and nepotism? Still, accepting the lanky Amitabh beating up 20 goondas with scissor kicks and an old dented shovel means accepting the rest of the premise. In my eyes, however, it would have been much more realistic and cool if Shashi the cop and Amitabh the criminal joined forces to gyp everyone out of their cash, and to live out the rest of their natural lives in Hong Kong or London. It doesn't work out that way though, and Shashi betrays his brother for a 30 cent scrap of copper attached to a ribbon and called a medal.The mom in the movie annoyed me big-time though, her idealistic rantings and ravings made me yawn and ask myself if any old Indian woman could be so naive and stupid. I mean, if your son bought you the building you used to drag bricks to during it's construction 20 years ago, would you throw that all away just because the son bought it with drug and smuggling money? Come on.The climax scene is arguably the best ending in any Indian movie of the 70's, 80's and 90's, far surpassing Sholay's.

6.0,Deewar (The Wall),"I had for a long time heard about the most famous actor in India, possibly one of the most famous in the world, but I had never seen any of his films, so I was looking forward to seeing this Hindi language film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book. Basically, the Verma brothers Ravi (Shashi Kapoor) and Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) follow different life choices and career paths, Vijay becomes a criminal expert in smuggling and Ravi becomes a police inspector assigned to locate lawbreakers. They are the son of trade unionist Anand Verma (Satyendra Kapoor) who used his family as bait going against the management of his firm, and it resulted in being defeated and disgraced, and unable to cope with public humiliation he deserts the family. The two sons are raised by mother Sumitra Devi (Nirupa Roy) and taken to Bombay City, but as time goes by the two individually cause her, as a single mother, terrible trials and tribulations because of their choices. Vijay, the older of the brothers, has grown up aware of his father's humiliation and is victimised by those who know of it as well, he did start well in his youth as a simple boot polisher and dockland worker, but turns to a life of crime and a leading figure in the underworld. Ravi gets a good reputation for bringing law and order to the city, and his next assignment is to find a big name in the smuggling ring, he gets a terrible shock when he finds out it is his own brother, so he has no courage to arrest him and bring more shame to the family, despite his numerous opportunities. Also starring Parveen Babi as Anita, Neetu Singh as Leena Narang, Manmohan Krishna as DCP Narang, Madan Puri as Samant and Iftekhar as Mulk Raj Dhabaria. Bachchan as the young man who follows the wrong path is great at creating a both hateful and sympathetic character, and Kapoor as his law abiding brother does very well also, the story is just about easy to follow, a brother going bad and the other good, not stopping the law breaking due to the family bond and wanting to avoid disgrace, it is certainly a worthwhile Bollywood drama. Amitabh Bachchan was number 92 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars.

10.0,Cult Classic of Indain Cineam,"Deewar is my one of the favorite's, the main credit goes to the script writer (Salim- Javed) and of-course legendary Yash Chopra, who is such a fine craftsman. Deewar has no extra ordinary story, its the characters which make this movie as a cult classic. For me deewar is one of those movies which was quite ahead of its time; dealing with the theme of good and evil Yash chopra has done complete justice with it. The scene shot below the bridge is one of the best scene ever shot and again its the characters which should be credited for it and the punch line, Mere Paas Ma Hai. In one of the scenes, Vijay (Amitabh) makes a deal with a builder, after deal is done, builder advises Vijay that he is not good in business as he has purchased at a much higher price. The way Vijay reverts is simply mind blowing, no words can ever express that intensity which vijay intents at that particular moment.Another best part is the love angle between Amitabh and Praveen babhi is not given much of importance, unlike of our tradional cinema. The last scene of the movie, where vijay prays for his Mom is again tremendous and full of energy, he has simply transformed the cliché dialog into one of the most memorable ones; ""Aaj Kush to bahut honge tum"" Although Vijay (Amitabh) portray's the gray shaded character and Ravi (Shashi Kapoor) plays the honest cop, its vijay which impacts and connects more then Ravi's character, thats why i said it was way ahead of its time.The character of Vijay is based on the real character, Haji Mastan big time smuggler from Mumbai. After watching movies like Deewar, Trishul and Kabhi Kabhi, i always baffles about the current choice of Chopra camp.

10.0,BigB just Tops above else. A must see.,"A timeless classic. It's one of Amitabh Sir best movies. He is the brightest point in it. He plays an intelligent criminal that tops the syndicate through own effort. His brother is the honest policeman who wouldn't go against the principles of virtue. And their mother is the only bridge that joins them. A movie that will grip your attention throughout in every rewatchable experience.The movie is basically the story of a family which exist through various hardships and success. The abandoning of the family by their father (Mr Verma) triggers the troubles. Throughout the hardships, both brothers takes opposite paths. They both collide and the tumult begins in the family. For Vijay it's a story from rags to riches. For Ravi it's a story from jolly to guilt ridden. Both exists as pessimistic and optimistic stance with their mother. They try to reconciliate but their opposite existence bounds them to act accordingly. From beginning to climax all characters are justified, marked by rigid genuineity.Now, about the technicals, they are perfect as of 1970s standard. Songs adhere proportionately to the situation. The performances are praiseworthy esp for BigB. He is the strong pillar of the movie though antagonist. His role as the criminal, ungodly and rational person but still pragmatic in family unity is top notch. Others are also fine. The script and narration style is gripping and matured. The camera angles are intensified gives the depth of portrayed events. A flavour of masterpiece mingled throughout.

9.0,The Greatest Trick!,"Deewar (that, interestingly enough in English, would loosely be pronounced ""The War"" without the risk of falling out of the context of the story!) is a treat in every aspect. Drama, action, emotions, romance, tears - everything has been added in perfect quantity. No one who has watched it would ever forget the strong & clever reference of a Hindu using billa (badge) number 786 (a number sacred for Mulims and how it saves his life on occasions) or the sequence where one brother boasts screamingly of having the ""world"" and the other - in undertone - reveals he has the mother! However ..... there is a SERIOUS flaw! Remember the first and the last shot of the film? Its the mother accepting a medal on behalf of her son inspector Shahshi Kapoor. Remember everything in between? Its all in flashback. So? What is wrong with that? Well ..... nothing!That is, if you are comfortable with the mother ""flashing back"" to show us her son - Amitabh - screwing Parveen Bobby passionately, Parveen attempting abortion or something, the son roaming around shirtless, et al. How the makers got away with it and why did they choose not to show it in linear form is still a mystery.With that ""minor"" glitch, Deewar is inarguably one of the finest movies of the Big B. The writer duo of Saleem-Javed has created some of the most memorable lines and one of the most fascinating films in the history of Asian cinema. The director and producer deserve a medal on each anniversary of the film!

8.0,Emergence of the angry young man.,"Deewaar review :Rising from abject poverty, two brothers end up on opposite sides of the law - one a cop, the other a gangster. Salim Javed's Deewaar was basically Mother India (1957) updated for 70s social scenario and presented from the point of view of the erring son, not the maa.The anti hero Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) is himself, a product of the corrupt system which betrayed his idealistic father (Satyen Kapoo) to render them homeless in a big bad city. Vijay has seen how cruelly the world treated his mother (Nirupa Roy) and wishes to settle scores with the system some day - a hypocrite rotten society which tattooed ""Mera Baap Chor Hai"" on his arm.Amitabh's Vijay cares two hoots for the textbook ideals and principles which dont exist in the real world. ""Tumhare adarsh tumhare usool do waqt ka khaana nahi de sakte"", he admonishes younger bro Shashi Kapoor going to the extent of asking him to bring signatures of all those who tormented them in the past. ""Jao uss aadmi ka sign leke aao jisne mere haath mein yeh likh diya!!"".Deewaar cemented Amitabh Bachchan's image of angry young man which started with Prakash Mehra's Zanjeer (1973) and he became the voice of the frustrated youth of those times who identified with his angst and anger.Salim Javed's script was laden with brilliant dialogues and intense situations. Amitabh's rant in the temple - ""Aaj khush toh bahut hoge tum"" - was copied in many 80s films but none could register that kind of an impact. Bachchan's death scene is still so memorable and after Sholay (1975) which released same year, some superstitious filmmakers began to believe than any film in which Amitabh dies becomes a super hit. Haha!Finally, Deewaar is to Amitabh what Devdas (1955) is to Dilip Kumar. It built the actors formidable image as angry young man and paved the way for many successful films in the future.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni",emergence angry young man,deewaar review rising abject poverty two brothers end up opposite sides law one cop other gangster salim javeds deewaar was basically mother india 1957 updated 70s social scenario presented point view erring son not maa anti hero vijay amitabh bachchan is himself product corrupt system which betrayed his idealistic father satyen kapoo render them homeless big bad city vijay has seen how cruelly world treated his mother nirupa roy wishes settle scores with system some day hypocrite rotten society which tattooed mera baap chor hai his arm amitabhs vijay cares two hoots textbook ideals principles which dont exist real world tumhare adarsh tumhare usool do waqt ka khaana nahi de sakte he admonishes younger bro shashi kapoor going extent asking him bring signatures all those who tormented them past jao uss aadmi ka sign leke aao jisne mere haath mein yeh likh diya deewaar cemented amitabh bachchans image angry young man which started with prakash mehras zanjeer 1973 he became voice frustrated youth those times who identified with his angst anger salim javeds script was laden with brilliant dialogues intense situations amitabhs rant temple aaj khush toh bahut hoge tum was copied many 80s films but none could register that kind impact bachchans death scene is still so memorable after sholay 1975 which released same year some superstitious filmmakers began believe than any film which amitabh dies becomes super hit haha finally deewaar is amitabh what devdas 1955 is dilip kumar it built actors formidable image as angry young man paved way many successful films future regards sumeet nadkarni,0.5459677419354839,-0.030913978494623604,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.2, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.37}"

This story loosely based on one time underworld don ""HAJI MASTAAN"", he was a dock yard worker, which played by Amitabh Bachhan (vijay).Story started with a union leader who fought for their rights. But the owners of the factory plotted conspiracy and termed him a thief. His family could not face the society and moved out from that place. The older son could not forget this and became a sensitive person. In circumstances he kept his feet in criminal world and soon became underworld don. But his brother became a cop and he's now trying to nab his brother. Director tackles this story quite well.",this is one master craft,i guess after sholay this is one best movies indian cinema must see this movie is one finest blend movie indian cinema what terrific performance mr bachchan direction dialogs acting everything mixed so well this story loosely based one time underworld don haji mastaan he was dock yard worker which played by amitabh bachhan vijay story started with union leader who fought their rights but owners factory plotted conspiracy termed him thief his family could not face society moved out that place older son could not forget this became sensitive person circumstances he kept his feet criminal world soon became underworld don but his brother became cop hes now trying nab his brother director tackles this story quite well,0.4503205128205128,0.09871794871794874,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.19}"
