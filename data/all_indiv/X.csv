8.0,Nice old-fashioned horror-flick with some hefty gore.,"I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!).",nice old fashioned horror flick with some hefty gore,i liked it its nice old fashioned flawlessly 70s styled slasher horror flick with fairly original premise as any comparable horror movie motives killings are pretty farfetched but who cares when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome gore here is definitely not tender hearted another strong point is how movie very gradually builds up tension this is real slow burner apprehension looming doom is palpable throughout movie this is helped by strong direction very clever inventive editing some great photography see instance scene one girls swimming lake while well i wont give it away but its beautiful hair raisingly scary at same time add all this some very funny dialogues goings at start youre well made old school horror flick maybe not life changing but absolutely entertaining those who can apprciate this kind movie like me,0.7196666666666666,0.26533333333333325,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.24}"
,Ti West's exploitation mash-up,"Ti West's movie really should have been called ""E"" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the ""Director"" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the ""crew"" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride.",ti wests exploitation mash up,ti wests movie really should have been called e elevated it sets itself up as smart take slasher films 70s early 80s as bonus film within film has filmmakers making elevated porn flick as bonus actor owen campbell who plays director even looks bit like director tobe hooper quite consciously taking its set up tobe hoopers 1974 texas chainsaw massacre x has group randy pornographers renting farmhouse elderly couple middle nowhere texas actually new zealand writer director wests main idea here is set up contrast between xxx filmmakers bible thumping civilians area its not uninteresting idea which course plays off puritanical cliche slasher films yore where most sexually active characters are most likely g et killed off addition massacre west includes nods friday 13th hoopers eaten alive very specific one halloween x is set about 5 years after massacre so that it can include brief exchange about how home video will change porno industry adult films were already available vhs about 3 years movie is very well directed with savvy use cross cutting between porn film making terrors that await group mia goth dual role actually triple if you stay after credits brittany snow are two pornstars be each dive with relish kid cudi is cocky stud while martin henderson is solid as confidant producer jenna ortega is crew all by her lonesome she manages keep her clothes must have better agent stephen ure is ornery old man who rents out his guest house as good as filmmaking is x ends up feeling too studied pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards very end once massacre begins if not by power tools it still ends up being fairly typical films its commenting regardless how well executed elevated it thinks it is its also too drawn out satisfy some gore hounds once blood starts flowing probably too gross internet scribes dreaming doing extended online essays dissecting it its elevated intellect there are couple twists but they arent sufficient enough compensate predictability end its not as clever as west thinks it is despite some good directing chops acting its simply too self conscious be much fun thrill ride,0.3788390663390663,0.11308061308061311,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.39}"

5.0,Overhyped. Doesn't live up to A24 other films.,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors.",overhyped doesnt live up a24 other films,while i knew this film was presented as slasher film going i had better expectations given it was a24 studios film despite some famous names cast i wouldnt consider it good probably my least favorite a24 films film is made cinematography style classic 1970s slasher films but it holds back brutality with females i really wished a24 was above pc culture true 70s slasher horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with old woman zomb et at end i was hoping at least slightly smarter screenplay given it is a24 but disappointingly no mia goth was probably only likable character film but i feel special effects people overdid prosthetics with old couple they resemble zombie monsters far more than elderly they could have placed real elderly couple there instead yes film does have some gore blood but its predominately very tame film worst it all is disembowel cow hit by truck highway its not even part main story we also see aftermath accident i dont feel film deserves be elevated because technical production authentic 1970s low budget b films were not technically sophisticated camera work lighting fancy lighting best cinematographers time were reserved mainstream big studio films not low budget horror with todays pre fab software plugins templates adobe software copying style wasnt einstein endeavor had this film been made by any other no name production studio it would have been relegated into another netflix original category not given accolades recent netflix texas chainsaw original 2022 is just as good film as this one minus famous actors,0.4877721088435376,0.12012317048031336,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"

Martin is the producer that rents the farm location and Mia, Brittany and Kid are the films' stars-and yes, there is graphic nudity. Jenna is handling the equipment behind the camera. One of the first things you notice is that there is something odd about the old couple that own the farm, especially the old woman. Slowly, things become clear about the intentions of both of the farm owners and it gets bloody violent.

4.0,A sex-crazed gore-fest that lacks its 'X' factor,"After being involved in some great modern horror films such as Hereditary (2018) and Saint Maud (2019), A24's latest film is an immature mess that feels more like an exercise in superfluity than it is a meaningful narrative.Set in 1979, X follows six Americans as they arrive at an isolated farmhouse for a weekend, intent on shooting a porno. Hosted by an unsettling, elderly couple, things soon turn into a full-blown bloodbath.Obviously inspired by Tobe Hooper's classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), writer-director Ti West ensured that X was full of slasher tropes, adding little originality to an already saturated genre. Where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality. Mia Goth's Maxine is noticeably unstable but tries to believe that she is a star. Bobby-Lynne, played well by Brittany Snow, comes across as the more witty, experienced porn actor. Jackson (Kid Cudi) is a Vietnam veteran, while Wayne (Martin Henderson) and RJ (Owen Campbell) provide the overseeing eyes to the pornographic production. Finishing off the cast, Jenny Ortega plays the outsider of the group, Lorraine.Lacking believable or serious motives, the killers in the film were nonetheless unique, providing some creepiness and mystery. However, this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons for their murderous streak. They will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters.From the beginning, the film uses themes of religion to juxtapose the vices taking place. The TV in the house shows a programme of a preacher discussing sin, which is repeated throughout the film. As well as this, a well-crafted shot of Lorraine taking off her cross while giving in to the temptation of being involved in the pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed. Unfortunately, the theme is only touched upon within the hour-forty-five runtime, in what seems a missed opportunity to flesh out the barren story.This slasher focuses too much on numerous scenes of nudity in the first half of the film which then mostly moves aside to allow for excessive gore. The extended sex scenes are used in place of well-written dialogue and provide little else than what you would expect. It seems as if Ti West had more of an interest in indulging in some sort of manic sex-gore film than providing any substance to this horror show. And while the gore was well executed with some great effects on display, they are at times over the top and not for the faint of heart.The editing of the film was unique, but rather out of place. Alongside this, X lacked adequate direction, with suspense in short supply and predictability with every kill. The film did not use perspective enough and could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing the viewer's vision and creating a more personal point of view.Without a strong plot, X fails to create a memorable story and instead focuses on showing something more akin to a pornographic film and a gore-fest. The killers were boring and the kills felt formulaic. Decently written characters could not make up for some of the bizarre dialogue and while gore was in abundance suspense was not.",sex crazed gore fest that lacks its x factor,after being involved some great modern horror films such as hereditary 2018 saint maud 2019 a24s latest film is immature mess that feels more like exercise superfluity than it is meaningful narrative set 1979 x follows six americans as they arrive at isolated farmhouse weekend intent shooting porno hosted by unsettling elderly couple things soon turn into full blown bloodbath obviously inspired by tobe hoopers classic texas chainsaw massacre 1974 writer director ti west ensured that x was full slasher tropes adding little originality already saturated genre where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality mia goths maxine is noticeably unstable but tries believe that she is star bobby lynne played well by brittany snow comes across as more witty experienced porn actor jackson kid cudi is vietnam veteran while wayne martin henderson rj owen campbell provide overseeing eyes pornographic production finishing off cast jenny ortega plays outsider group lorraine lacking believable or serious motives killers film were nonetheless unique providing some creepiness mystery however this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons their murderous streak they will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters beginning film uses themes religion juxtapose vices taking place tv house shows programme preacher discussing sin which is repeated throughout film as well as this well crafted shot lorraine taking off her cross while giving temptation being involved pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed unfortunately theme is only touched upon within hour forty five runtime what seems missed opportunity flesh out barren story this slasher focuses too much numerous scenes nudity first half film which then mostly moves aside allow excessive gore extended sex scenes are used place well written dialogue provide little else than what you would expect it seems as if ti west had more interest indulging some sort manic sex gore film than providing any substance this horror show while gore was well executed with some great effects display they are at times over top not faint heart editing film was unique but rather out place alongside this x lacked adequate direction with suspense short supply predictability with every kill film did not use perspective enough could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing viewers vision creating more personal point view without strong plot x fails create memorable story instead focuses showing something more akin pornographic film gore fest killers were boring kills felt formulaic decently written characters could not make up some bizarre dialogue while gore was abundance suspense was not,0.5549640610961367,0.16307277628032343,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.28}"

8.0,"A Fun, Classically Styled Slasher","Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time.",fun classically styled slasher,paying homage slashers yesteryear is nothing new but ti wests new movie x makes it feel fresh he does this by primarily bringing attention sex parts genre exploring what sex means this is after all part about crew people attempting make porno but sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation it is at heart film west seems be most interested what experience means whether its love way recapture youth or getting most out life while one is still capable experiencing act beyond all this though is fun classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation slasher mayhem some may find amount nudity sex heck subject matter itself distasteful but slasher fans this will remind you much early years genre lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by texas chainsaw massacre its easy see why majority film revolves around singular location old farm seemingly middle nowhere texas ripe plenty slasher fun ti doesnt skimp red stuff either while nothing gets too outlandishly creative we do get some brutal kills with often gory results it helps that characters are written well likable despite sleazy material theyre attempting create they dont feel shallow or sleazy themselves they believe their work reasons making it while it may have been nice get little more depth out them they clearly have history there are things hinted at that never get much development theyre at least decent crowd folks who are fun be around as villains theyre not quite as out there or mysterious as trailer would lead you believe fact theyre pretty grounded but never less creepy tension is maintained consistently once violence starts if you know what films about you have pretty good idea what expect it does take some unusual turns but me that only added just how much film stood its own it certainly feels like fresh entry into slasher genre something genre needs ti west continues make name himself as someone watch out have fun with this sexy bloody good time,0.5289602372935706,0.14644159852493188,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"

6.0,"Nothing new here, but nothing bad either","An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.My Rating: 5.8/10.",nothing new here but nothing bad either,interesting slow burn but without enough make it stand against countless other slasher films x is fine film another tribute iconic genre that made horror so popular first place granted i do enjoy myself slasher film time time im quite fond films like nightmare elm street my bloody valentine but where x faults among others is through using rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose throughout film characters often talk about x factor something that makes mia goths character special starworthy but unlike its mentionings this film just doesnt have that acting is really good i love underrated mia goth as always as well as brittany snow martin henderson even kid cudi did rather impressive job cinematography is fantastic perfectly fits amitpshere tone film is going music is enjoyable tense its pacing can be bit slow at times but does allow interesting point view its main problem lies solely its script which revolves largely around smut film production but takes too many elements formulaic tendencies other horror films like evil dead friday 13th visit most obviously texas chainsaw massacre really stand out its own become its own thing end its not bad watch i wouldnt watch it again but i certainly didnt mind watching it it isnt most memorable but i certainly dont have any disdain it it just could have been more especially given talent involved but ironically it settled less my rating 5 8 10,0.561751443001443,0.20561868686868687,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.27}"
5.0,"Gross and weird, not in a good way","This is a technically well-made movie. It's a slow burn but I was never bored. I was enjoying it and curious to see what comes next. Until it got weird. And gross. This is coming from someone who watches tons of horror and gore. That wasn't the problem. The gore is one of the movie's best qualities.But the direction they take with some of the ""horror"" late in the movie is off-putting. I understand what they are going for. I understand that's the point. And the point does come across. It still doesn't change how I felt. Which was unsettled, not scared.Some people might like that type of ""horror"" (like Gabe from The Office lol). I am not one of those people.
