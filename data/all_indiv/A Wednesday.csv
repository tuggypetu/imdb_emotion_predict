8,"A picture that is both relevant, important and entertaining.","What can be said about this film? Like many other films made recently, this one is different from the typical Hindi masala flicks (nothing against them, I think they're enjoyable), there are no songs, there is no combination of different genres in one film, it is not a three-hour film. It's a simple, small film of merely 90 minutes, yet it succeeds at telling its story and conveying its intended message in this limited time.The story begins as an ordinary thriller about a common man who calls the police and informs them about 5 bombs he has allegedly placed all over Mumbai, which he'll get exploded if they don't release four terrorists. The way every scene is carried by the director is very impressive and the dialogues are realistic. The film flows as a great thriller as time passes by, but then unexpectedly becomes into a dramatic story as it unfolds the motives of this common man.The film does not want us to side any party, it wants us to understand the consequences of war, violence and hatred. It wants us to understand how it affects ordinary people. The story is not bigger than life, nor does it intend to be one. The fact that Naseeruddin Shah's character is unnamed only contributes to the universal message of the film.There are many sequences of different people shown in different portions of the film which are just amazing. The one when the officer played by Anupam Kher asks the policeman played by Aamir Bashir about his family status, and his willingness to find the bomb. The guy answers that he's married with a recently born baby girl, yet he'll do anything to find the bomb. Another, when Naseer recalls the young nice guy he met every day in the train, the one who was preparing to marry someone, and gets killed the following day at the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. People must get what happens as a result of terror.The characters in this film are very well defined: a great and respected Police Commissioner, an ambitious journalist, a hot-tempered policeman who takes his job seriously, a common man who feels hurt, and many other policemen who'd give their life for the country. The film depicts national pride and the passion different people have for their work without going to large extents and unnecessary melodrama. It's done in a very realistic manner.The entire cast is wonderful, from leading actors to extras. Naseeruddin Shah does not know how to give a bad performance. He doesn't have to speak a lot or make strange facial expressions to be convincing. He doesn't have to play a grandiose king to make his role bigger than life. His dialogues come from the heart. It is yet another unforgettable performance from Naseer, the one and only. Anupam Kher is restrained and brilliant. The difference between the way he portrays serious yet sensitive men and the way he portrays comic and funny people is thrilling and incredible. Jimmy Shergill is amazing in a small yet pivotal role of a intransigent, hot-tempered, angry, disciplined and serious policeman. So is Aamir Bashir. Deepal Shaw is effective.Well, in conclusion, A Wednesday is an entertaining film with a universal message. Watch it, you'll enjoy it.",picture that is both relevant important entertaining,what can be said about this film like many other films made recently this one is different typical hindi masala flicks nothing against them i think theyre enjoyable there are no songs there is no combination different genres one film it is not three hour film its simple small film merely 90 minutes yet it succeeds at telling its story conveying its intended message this limited time story begins as ordinary thriller about common man who calls police informs them about 5 bombs he has allegedly placed all over mumbai which hell get exploded if they dont release four terrorists way every scene is carried by director is very impressive dialogues are realistic film flows as great thriller as time passes by but then unexpectedly becomes into dramatic story as it unfolds motives this common man film does not want us side any party it wants us understand consequences war violence hatred it wants us understand how it affects ordinary people story is not bigger than life nor does it intend be one fact that naseeruddin shahs character is unnamed only contributes universal message film there are many sequences different people shown different portions film which are just amazing one when officer played by anupam kher asks policeman played by aamir bashir about his family status his willingness find bomb guy answers that hes married with recently born baby girl yet hell do anything find bomb another when naseer recalls young nice guy he met every day train one who was preparing marry someone gets killed following day at 2006 mumbai train bombings people must get what happens as result terror characters this film are very well defined great respected police commissioner ambitious journalist hot tempered policeman who takes his job seriously common man who feels hurt many other policemen whod give their life country film depicts national pride passion different people have their work without going large extents unnecessary melodrama its done very realistic manner entire cast is wonderful leading actors extras naseeruddin shah does not know how give bad performance he doesnt have speak lot or make strange facial expressions be convincing he doesnt have play grandiose king make his role bigger than life his dialogues come heart it is yet another unforgettable performance naseer one only anupam kher is restrained brilliant difference between way he portrays serious yet sensitive men way he portrays comic funny people is thrilling incredible jimmy shergill is amazing small yet pivotal role intransigent hot tempered angry disciplined serious policeman so is aamir bashir deepal shaw is effective well conclusion wednesday is entertaining film with universal message watch it youll enjoy it,0.5733363858363857,0.14755799755799756,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8,"Nice, tight little masterpiece","I don't think I've smiled so broadly after watching a non-comedy for ages. Sadly, I don't think this is going to set the box-office alight (due to the lack of a bankable star) but it surely lit up my world and I'm going to recommend it to everyone.A man (Naseeruddin Shah) calls up the police HQ, speaks to the Comissioner of Police (Anupam Kher) and advises him that he has planted 5 bombs across Mumbai and will detonate them until his demands are met. The only demand he makes is that four known terrorists are gathered together. All the cops, their intelligence, the Chief Minister etc are not able to trace this person or get any information about him. What does he do next ? Who will win, this unknown person or the wily commissioner, who has all the resources of the state at his disposal ? The movie doesn't really start till about the fortieth minute mark, just plods along till then. But then once it begins, it manages to keep the tension alive very nicely. I haven't seen too many Hindi movies with a central control room or a good cop and bad cop routine (ably played by Aamir and Jimmy respectively) and this one pulls off both quite nicely. Also, it thankfully remains focused on the plot and doesn't deviate for any item songs or normal songs or romantic interludes. There are several nice touches as well Â– the CM's exclamation, 'He Parmeswara', when informed about the crisis. The whole 'Electric Baba' thing. Or the way the terrorists identify themselves to Naseer (will let you find that out for yourself) or the way the director litters a few red herrings around. Great acting by everyone, great editing and camera work and very well put together.I've had similar thoughts as the film's lead character a few times. Maybe not as drastic but getting there, give me time, this film has merely watered a germinating seed. I would love to talk more, expound on what I'm feeling but am forcing myself to desist. This is one of the pleasures of being a reviewer, the ability to introduce a rare, hidden gem to the audience. Please see it before you find out how it ends.

6,The Politics of Cinema...,"Some pretty ordinary performances and, as the final quarter approaches you feel as though you're watching a plot that's been transplanted throughout most countries film industries over the years, after starting life by germinating in America. But then it wakes up and, without giving anything away, becomes a film that would struggle to take root in too many places and might even be considered propaganda, a party political broadcast by the common man (and woman I assume).",politics cinema,some pretty ordinary performances as final quarter approaches you feel as though youre watching plot thats been transplanted throughout most countries film industries over years after starting life by germinating america but then it wakes up without giving anything away becomes film that would struggle take root too many places might even be considered propaganda party political broadcast by common man woman i assume,0.47777777777777786,0.06666666666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.6}"
10,A Wednesday in a lifetime,"IT IS TRUE WHAT THEY SAY about greatness. It is always meant to be. No amount of planning or foresight or pundits with beards longer than their hands can ever truly make someone something one is not. If one is destined to be great Â– one is. Most times one wonders how much more one has to shout and scream so that people can take notice while other timesÂ…well, other times silences creep in so beautifully that we hardly recognize them and something breathe taking has already been created.Before, dear reader, the assumption is made that I am off on a track quite abstract to the common man Â– ah, that word suddenly sounds so powerful Â– let me underline the topic I have chosen. I was browsing through my usual collection of review websites when I happened to get a glimpse of one interesting review. It was for a movie I had never heard of. Neither had I ever seen any publicity posters of it nor had I guessed it would feature two of my all time favorites Â– Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. The fact that no one else, except maybe the highly underestimated Jimmy Shergill, was even remotely recognizable on the credit list apart from these three did not deter me from giving it a shot. Bollywood these days is being showered with 'alternate' cinema that runs a delicate line between commercial masala-fundas and the documentary type approaches. In such a rain it is easy to miss some true refreshingly different rain drops. Having shied away from such features for a while, I decided to give this a look-see since I knew Naseer and Anupam would definitely make it worth my time. With that random assumption, I began watching 'A Wednesday'.Two hours laterÂ…I was going through a very rare feeling. I did not understand it initially since it had been such a long time but then, I knew. It was the same bunch of emotions I had felt when I had seen the climax of 'The Sixth Sense'. It was the same 'Oh wow!' feeling that had pierced my veins as the final few minutes of 'The Usual Suspects' drowned in my eyes. It was the very unique gut sense of genuine enthusiasm I had felt when I finally understood 'Momento' in its last frame.But, this time it was different. I had never felt such a tingle in my heart for a Hindi movie in many years. Sure, I have had my share of laughs and appreciation for some decent Indian cinema over the years, but there was never anything in them that made me say to myself 'Â…he is so rightÂ…this could happen to me tooÂ…todayÂ…tomorrowÂ…any dayÂ…' since there was never any context. What 'A Wednesday' successfully did was pick me up from my starry eyed slumber and slap a 'REALITY CHECK' sticker on my face. It reminded me of the times we are part of. It made me wonder about my own life and how unsure things are in the world we live in. It, if not anything else, made me think.I am sure people often sigh and yawn about movies that make them 'think' since it is exactly the opposite reason of why one would watch a movie. No one wants to see relevant issues these days. There is a huge fan following for the larger than life, escapist features which come and go every week. We Indians, the world's best consumers, lap it up in all our glee not caring about if it had anything to do with our life. Why? Since it does not matter. It never does, does it? But then how long can we keep doing this? Once in a while we do need that refreshing slap on the face that makes us realize who we really are. And what a wonderful slap this was! No better way to bring me back to reality than a movie like this one. I was applauding myself for having taken a chance and seen one of the most relevant movies of our times. A silent yet beautiful effort at capturing human emotion on the screen. To summarize in one word Â– great.Do yourself a favor Â– watch 'A Wednesday'. A must see for every Indian according to me. If not anything else it will definitely catch you by surprise! I strongly recommend this movie to everyone who has ever sat back and said 'I wish things were differentÂ…'",wednesday lifetime,it is true what they say about greatness it is always meant be no amount planning or foresight or pundits with beards longer than their hands can ever truly make someone something one is not if one is destined be great one is most times one wonders how much more one has shout scream so that people can take notice while other times well other times silences creep so beautifully that we hardly recognize them something breathe taking has already been created before dear reader assumption is made that i am off track quite abstract common man ah that word suddenly sounds so powerful let me underline topic i have chosen i was browsing through my usual collection review websites when i happened get glimpse one interesting review it was movie i had never heard neither had i ever seen any publicity posters it nor had i guessed it would feature two my all time favorites naseeruddin shah anupam kher fact that no one else except maybe highly underestimated jimmy shergill was even remotely recognizable credit list apart these three did not deter me giving it shot bollywood these days is being showered with alternate cinema that runs delicate line between commercial masala fundas documentary type approaches such rain it is easy miss some true refreshingly different rain drops having shied away such features while i decided give this look see since i knew naseer anupam would definitely make it worth my time with that random assumption i began watching wednesday two hours later i was going through very rare feeling i did not understand it initially since it had been such long time but then i knew it was same bunch emotions i had felt when i had seen climax sixth sense it was same oh wow feeling that had pierced my veins as final few minutes usual suspects drowned my eyes it was very unique gut sense genuine enthusiasm i had felt when i finally understood momento its last frame but this time it was different i had never felt such tingle my heart hindi movie many years sure i have had my share laughs appreciation some decent indian cinema over years but there was never anything them that made me say myself he is so right this could happen me too today tomorrow any day since there was never any context what wednesday successfully did was pick me up my starry eyed slumber slap reality check sticker my face it reminded me times we are part it made me wonder about my own life how unsure things are world we live it if not anything else made me think i am sure people often sigh yawn about movies that make them think since it is exactly opposite reason why one would watch movie no one wants see relevant issues these days there is huge fan following larger than life escapist features which come go every week we indians worlds best consumers lap it up all our glee not caring about if it had anything do with our life why since it does not matter it never does does it but then how long can we keep doing this once while we do need that refreshing slap face that makes us realize who we really are what wonderful slap this was no better way bring me back reality than movie like this one i was applauding myself having taken chance seen one most relevant movies our times silent yet beautiful effort at capturing human emotion screen summarize one word great do yourself favor watch wednesday must see every indian according me if not anything else it will definitely catch you by surprise i strongly recommend this movie everyone who has ever sat back said i wish things were different,0.5078310359231414,0.18422690248348142,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
5,People Don't Know What to Make of This Film,"Like many other people, the reason I came to watch ""A Wednesday"" was because it features in the current IMDB top 250 list. The film was also necessary viewing for the top 250 lists of 2016 and 2017 previously. I was quite confused, and immediately sceptical, as to why this 2008 Indian film was only recently coming into the spotlight. For most other movies, this usually indicates a film of high quality. However, as my 5/10 (average) rating suggests, ""A Wednesday"" is a film FAR removed from the quality required to merit such a position. It is notable to say that of the 198 films I have seen of the current top 250, this film has received the lowest rating from myself.With that context in mind, I shall now talk about my assessment of the film. The most egregious aspects of ""A Wednesday"" are definitely in the ""action"" set pieces. The physical confrontations (one interrogation scene and another chase scene) are woefully uncoordinated to the point of parody. The acting in these scenes fall under heavy scrutiny, unfortunately, as a direct result of this and is entirely unconvincing. The sound editing is perhaps the worst part of these scenes (it sounds like it's come directly from a children's toy/soundboard). It is so jarring that it would have undermined the action scenes even if they had been well choreographed. The special effects are also unconvincing but, since it has a minute presence, it doesn't hinder the film too greatly. I am also unaware if there were budgetary limitations the film had in its making so I don't think it would be entirely fair for me to condemn it for that. Luckily, there is little action to corrupt the entire film but this has led to some reviewers stating that the film is a boring office set piece as a result. I'd be inclined to disagree as the film's premise out with the action offered the greatest potential that the film ultimately failed to fully fulfil. A further, but more pervasive ""flaw"" is in the film's editing. There is an overabundance of slow-motion footage and abrupt cuts. However, I would say that although the film's editing will come across as a bit cheesy it is still of an adequate quality. This could be as much a case of time working against the film if anything (although I doubt that is the case).I will now address the more positive aspects that the film has to offer. The acting from the main cast is decent for the most part; Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah play the police commissioner (Prakash Rathod) and the ""terrorist"" known only as ""The Common Man"" play off of each other well. The script is decent and has some interesting dialogue (one scene comes to mind were Rathod tests his officer's commitment to finding the bombs was a highlight) but I felt that the concept had a lot more potential than its final product. The villain's motivations were interesting and certainly more 3 dimensional than your typical action movie, however, again, I felt that they could have gone into more depth into his character. The conclusion seems to inspire a profound sense of patriotism in the Indian people (hence its high rating) when the two stars finally come together. Whilst understandable, I was a bit disappointed that they didn't go further with the moral conflict here and didn't attempt to provide a more nuanced argument. The film reminded me of the anime ""Death Note"" to some degree and I was hoping to see a high stakes battle of wits unfold similar to the likes of ""L"" and ""Light Yagami"" or between ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Moriarty"". The secondary villains (a group of terrorists) are played well enough but I felt that they were more 1 dimensional in presentation. I'd also finish by saying that the cinematography for the film is suitably engaging and the camera is dynamic enough to keep your concentration during the film's slower segments.I'd like to finish on a more positive note as I attempt to lend some support to this film. I noticed that ""A Wednesday"" had a 5.4 rating from the ""top 1000 voters"" on IMDB with the highest percentage (22.5%) of those giving the film a rating of 1/10. In the same way that I have criticised people who have overrated this film (resulting in its unjust placement in the top 250) I feel that I also need to criticise those who are being equally unreasonable in their negativity. Objectively speaking, this film does a lot of things fairly well and others poorly thus warranting its 5/10 (average) rating from myself. ""A Wednesday"" is a competently enough made film with a coherent story, decent acting and cinematography etc so it could DEFINITELY be a lot worse. I wonder how many top 1000 voters have seen the IMDB's BOTTOM 100 movies as a frame of reference. I've even seen top 1000 voters give the likes of ""Jaws"" and ""The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" 1/10 ratings!To summarise, this film is highly overrated on IMDb and shouldn't be on the top 250. At the same time, it is a decent enough movie which works well enough within its limitations- I doubt ""A Wednesday"" was made with the intent of becoming an all-time great film! Just a simple, honest thriller. I found it moderately enjoyable, if forgettable, and think it should be recognised as such. I ask South Asian reviewers to seriously reconsider the films that they are trying to promote as the best of Bollywood cinema. Films like this and ""Andaz Apna Apna"" are really overrated and annoy and scare off Westerners from watching your other films- and that's a massive shame. There are good Bollywood films out there like ""3 Idiots"" so try and promote these films instead. Please try and consider how your films will resonate with global audiences, I know Westerners should do the same but the sad fact is we can afford to do so because of the more global reach of Hollywood. To address Westerners, don't take out your anger out on the film for its high rating, it's not its fault, so I just ask reviewers to be fair in their assessment. If you're the kind of person to give this film a 1/10 rating just to take it off of the top 250 then you're just being hypocritical! Be consistent and objective in your criticism and, hopefully, this will encourage others to do the same.",people dont know what make this film,like many other people reason i came watch wednesday was

A Wednesday tells the story of certain events that take place between 2 and 6 pm on a Wednesday in Mumbai. Events that are not on any record.'A Wednesday,' questions the injustice done to the common man, when innocents meet their end, following bomb blasts. The story rests on the shoulders of two stalwarts, Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah supported ably by Jimmy Shergill and Aamir Bashir. As the city police commissioner, Anupam lends the role dignity and he has executed it brilliantly.Naseeruddin Shah steals the show with his character. Jimmy Shergill is every inch the cool guy. Aamir Bashir leaves a mark too.

9,A Must See,"There are a few movies that entertain, there are a few movies that give message and then there are a few movies that you can relate to. A Wednesday is definitely one such movie.The story revolves around an anonymous man (Shah) who calls up the commissioner of police (Kher) and informs him about the bombs that he has placed. Bomb blast is something that I personally am scared of. It had ripped Mumbai in 1993 and then in local train and bus. Only people stood by each other. It followed thru out the country. And what can one common man do? . The story line is fantastic. Its hard to believe that this is Neeraj Pandey's first movie and he has taken a gigantic leap without including any songs. The movie itself is only one and a half hours - half of what Bollywood movies usually are. Then he has not shown the police administration either as corrupt or the bookish kind of honest. He has probably taken the real view of police department And then the cast. Naseerudding Shah is one actor who can crawl under the skin of any character. Be it the coach in Iqbal or the pirate in The League of Extra-ordinary gentlemen. Then there is Anupam Kher whose acting abilities are still not tapped to the best by any director.

8,Relevant to the current situation in India,"I gave an extra point just for the fact that this is relevant cinema. Instead of churning out the next round of mindlessness that earns 140 crores due to the multiplexed masses, this one tries to talk about the current helplessness faced by the common man in India. The topic for discussion is terrorism. The movie begins with a phone call to the Police Commissioner informing him of bombs and asking for the release of 4 terrorists.. The movie then predictably moves into the Negotiator and clock ticking genre.The acting is well done, the plot maybe not that believable but the dialogue at the end is gripping and humane. Naseer and Anupam are as good as they are - no surprises there. There are no songs (GOOD!) and the movie chugs along at an okay pace.. The movie doesn't have a solution... rightly so coz terrorism has none too I believe. It just voices out the anguish of the little the common man expects but has become a rarity now. Expect no hitchcockian twists and you should be happy for the price of your ticket. Certain things that we ""get used to"" leads to the entire society being trodden upon.

9,An Engrossing Affair!,"A Wednesday' is a brave attempt which makes a commentary about the social and political fabric of India. In the recent past, many Hindi movies have treaded along this path and sought to bring in a revolution in at least the way people think about issues. 'A Wednesday' is a welcome addition to that league.It mocks the government, reminding it of the duties it ought to be performing as the caretaker of the common people. Another thumbs up for showing the power of the common man and stating in no uncertain terms that religion is secondary to nationality.And the best part is that all this social commentary isn't preachy so to speak.

10,"""When's day""","So when's that day??? When we will rise like phoenix from the ashes.......So cutting it out to the movie........First lets talk about the movie...... Movie per se is too good and I was moved by the very idea of the movie. As i am not checking the spoiler box, I must be brief......Though the movie is incomparable and nothing can be said without exposing the plot. Now I can easily say that Bollywood is showing some of its traits that can be compared to a Hollywood movie. The idea of the movie is among the best I have ever seen. This movie should go for Oscars not involving any kind of politics this time.Lets see what can be said about the components of the movie, to start with we have 2 of the greatest Bollywood actor in the movie and chosen aptly for the roles. The four terrorists are chosen correctly for the role and also their getup is quite nice and appropriate. In the acting department only Deepal Shaw has shown some weakness, otherwise all the actors for big and small roles have shown their skills. Screenplay is good with too many story running simultaneously at the start of the movie. Cinematography is also fine with the scenes on the road, from the streets and all, also appreciable amount of money has been spent on it too. Background score is a bit too loud but some may find it appropriate but its not.....Editing is nice enough as the coherence is evident in the movie. Now what ..... the king of all ...... Mr Niraj, the director of the movie, he has done a great job by managing all the accoutrement on his back and using the right card at the right time.........This movie has an effect and is generally followed by a deep thinking........ ""When there's a match between India and Pakistan.....and when India loses ...

10,Instant Classic!,"They asked us on Friday, repeated on Tuesday...I am just replying back on A Wednesday. If someone asked me after the movie about what i had witnessed, I would say a work of brilliance.This is a movie that has made me happy and feel good literally and i mean it by each of my words.A Wednesday is a movie based on the repeated terrorist attacks made in different parts of India time and time again and its aftermath which makes the life of a common individual living amongst us the most painful and uncomfortable and how this common individual decides to respond to these hellish acts.I won't reveal the plot for those who haven't watched the movie yet but i would certainly say watch it and come up with your own views about it because If you happen to be an Indian who knows what exactly takes place in our country, you'll come up with the same statements that i had made earlier.About the making,the performances that stood out would be, hands down, that of both Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher but Mr Shah was at his usual stupendous best.His performance was simply exceptional and showed his genius.Jimmy shergill with Aamir bashir and the other actors also filled in brilliantly.The cinematography and screenplay were brilliant. The pace of the movie in accordance with its plot was picture perfect and terrific but the thing that stood out about the movie was its thrill and drama that captivated the audience along with its pace and storyline.The climax drawn was also outstanding and the director was immaculate with his work of direction. The most wonderful thing about this movie is that the whole plot runs by taking the audience and the viewers along with it and towards the end,the climax brings and involves the audience deep into the theme of the movie and makes one feel oneself as the most important part of it.

8,"Intriguing till the end, you just canâ€™t help but love the course it takes!","Prior to release, the media called it the much awaited coming together of Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. Pitted against each other, one is a cool headed terror brain and the latter is the Commissioner of Police who has to balance between political masters and his logic on the situation he gets into on a Wednesday. If not for anything else, Naseeruddin Shah was the biggest draw factor for a power packed performance.India has been rocked by numerous terrorist attacks with Mumbai being their favorite. Underscoring the helplessness that the administration always expresses against such attacks, Wednesday makes a sincere effort to portray the travails that a common man has to put up with each day of his life, commuting to offices in crowded trains, traveling through crowded markets with a fear of losing his life to the act of some fanatic moron.A day before he retires, Commissioner Prakash Rathod reminisces the most memorable day of his service, a day where events just rolled out crippling the entire structure for internal security but that which ended without a case on record. The day begins with a demure, quiet man in the crowd whose name we arenâ€™t told, portrayed by Naseeruddin Shah who conveniently plants a bomb in a police station opposite the commissionerate.Shah then calls to Commissioner Rathod negotiating a release of four dreaded criminals accused of anti-national activities in exchange of disclosing the locations of explosives he planted. Shah also ropes in a TV Reporter Naina Roy, played by former item girl Deepal Shaw to cover the happenings live. The issue turns into an administrative and political potboiler that takes unexpected and unprecedented twists to a surprise end.Since Wednesday hinges on performances to make a point, it is noteworthy that each of them was spot on. Naseer is a class unto himself. Deepal Shaw was convincing as news junkie. Jimmy Shergill was picture perfect in his anti-terrorist cop role. The script has no loose ends and there are no songs disturbing the narrative. Art was thoughtful to place Shahâ€™s workstation atop an under construction building overlooking the city.While it is not your typical action thriller with blood and gore, it is neither a sermonizing thing that leaves you bored. On purpose, I chose not to disclose details of the plot, since I believe this movie is a must watch and should be enjoyed along with the suspense.

2,"""Mother"" India as a swaggering, chauvinist bully","Judging by the standing ovation, from an overwhelmingly Indian audience, that followed the showing of Neeraj Pandey's ""A Wednesday"" at New York's Museum of Modern Art in June 2009, this film struck deeply resonant chords in that audience, as it has with the great majority of the 83 IMDb reviewers thus far (most of whom are Indians, in-country or ex-pats). Politically-conscious foreign viewers seeking insight into the present state of mind of the Indian masses will find the results sobering. The ""Mother"" India portrayed here is a swaggering, xenophobic bully. ""A Wednesday"" serves as a point of pride for Hindu chauvinists thirsting for ""great power"" recognition: those for whom it is not enough to have the world's third-largest (and nuclear-armed) military but who also want popular culture to reflect the actual correlation of forces. The fact that ""we"" can now make a film with as much razzle-dazzle, high-tech, beat-em-up national superiority as those made by the world's only superpower shows that ""we"" have arrived. That this film ""can be compared to a Hollywood movie"" (Abhishek Kumar) is the highest praise possible.Despite the IMDb's warnings against spoilers, the plot details of this ""thriller"" have been covered amply in the already-submitted reviews, including a pretty clear description of the film's big, penultimate, plot twist, through which its main message is delivered. That message would be familiar to and appreciated by many in the U.S.: those for whom ""the world changed"" on September 11, 2001 (when they lost their illusion of invulnerability); those who wanted to round up every Arab, then every Muslim, then every swarthy ""foreigner""; those who lynched a turban-wearing Sikh or a dark-skinned Hispanic; those who thirsted for revenge, against any ""enemy,"" at any cost; those who were suckered into supporting the invasion and occupation of Iraq and those who still are being suckered into supporting the ""remaking"" of Afghanistan.The political subtext of ""A Wednesday"" was expressed approvingly by several of its IMDb enthusiasts: ""mocks the failure of the state machinery to give a free hand to the police force"" (chet rathod); ""right message to everyone . . . don't make us rebel back, it will cost you"" (Prashanth Patil); ""it's time that we woke up & be(came) intolerant of those who take the liberty to end hundreds of innocent lives for the sake of their own unhealthy psyche"" (The Moon! from India); ""you have to kill the cockroach of your house and no body will do this for you"" (abhi vega00). An extremely brutal Mumbai cop (played convincingly by Jimmy Shergill) who delivers a severe and prolonged public beating to a fellow cop, in full view of dozens of onlookers, is described as ""hot blooded"" by several of the film's admirers and as ""the policeman who means business"" (aniket-dave). But the habitual use of brutality is not restricted to a rogue cop. When he wants to extract some information from a jailed ""terrorist,"" the Mumbai Police Commissioner himself storms into the man's cell and proceeds to beat him unmercifully, repeatedly yelling ""have I asked you anything?"" over the victim's vain attempts to provide what is wanted. The message is clear: ""You are at my mercy and I can do anything I want with you. After I have beaten you sufficiently, you will tell me everything."" Some of the film's enthusiasts seem to have gone completely off the rails: ""most striking feature of the movie is its POSITIVITY"" (Jignesh Vaidya). Arun Iyer from Mumbai even called this film ""wholesome""! But there were cautions as well: ""Everything was fine with . . . movie except the idea of standing up against something using extreme means"" (Sree Harsha Sake).It restores one's faith in human decency and intelligence that at least some of the IMDb reviewers recognized this film's deep ugliness, pervasive racism and worship of brutality. ""The film is . . . stridently right-wing in its approach to terror"" (long-ford from India). It ""completely supports"" and ""glorifies . . . the 'fight violence with violence' method"" (The Discolored Chameleon). ""This film is constructed in a way to legitimate the use of force and violence by governmental agencies in case of emergency, and we, the terrified viewers, are invited to identify ourselves with the good guys and approve this point of view"" (dylndg from Madagascar).As some of its detractors point out, ""A Wednesday"" has no doubts about the identity of the enemy: Pakistan, its ISI (spy agency), Al Qaeda and, by implication, Muslims in general, are the sources of ""violence."" To his shame, the justly celebrated Indian actor, Naseeruddin Shah, allowed himself to be used here as a Muslim cover for the film's undisguised Islamophobia. The amused nod of familiarity from the Mumbai Police Commissioner (ably played by Anupam Kher) upon hearing the Muslim name of a suspected ""terrorist"" speaks volumes about the mind-set of the Hindu state.For a large section of humanity, whose attitudes are shaped by media controlled by their exploiters, ""terrorism"" is an activity exclusive to deranged individuals, predatory organizations and ""rogue"" states. When ""good countries"" (e.g. the U.S., Britain, Israel etc.) slaughter innocents, these acts are called ""accidents"" or ""unintended collateral damage."" Blessings on the heads of two reviewers from India (bruce-woodstock and Sreyas S S) for reminding us that the largest losses of life in India have been inflicted by official state violence and by communal riots. (The 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom in the State of Gujarat, during which thousands were killed and injured and tens of thousands made homeless at the hands of Hindu mobs, was facilitated by official indifference to â€” if not outright collusion in â€” the violence.) The outraged patriot does not perceive such violence as ""terrorism."" Nor does ""A Wednesday."" By advancing the need for a ""strong state,"" police brutality, torture and, if all else fails, vigilante justice, this film gives aid and comfort to the Dick Cheneys of the world.Barry Freed",mother

9,A character of BOMBay,"Numerous films have been based on terrorism and the tragedy of life in BOMBay. Some have a very serious and realistic take on it such as Black Friday and Mumbai Meri Jaan while some have been dramatized to showcase another aspect of terror such as in Dhoka and Aamir. Now, debutant director Neeraj Pandey brings an impactful and thought provoking thriller Â– A Wednesday, which transcends through the wavelengths of the cinema's sound system to stir up the frustrated citizen in you. All this happens through the articulate voice and superlative performance of Naseeruddin Shah as an anonymous mastermind who provokes the Police department with his threat of bombing the city in 5 different locations.The mastermind's plot builds up rapidly while all the characters are introduced and with his first phone call to the Commissioner of Police (Anupam Kher), the thrill ride begins in true Hollywood bad guy-NYPD style that includes a fancy control room, hi tech tracking units and loads of sophisticated equipment. At the helm of it all is Anupam Kher, the gifted actor who has been neglected for years and has been subjected to humiliating roles that do not suit his talent at all. We need to give all credit to Neeraj Pandey for just being bold enough to direct this thriller with two of the finest actors of Indian cinema. It is a treat to watch Anupam Kher in a serious character role rather than the slapstick comedy we have been subjected to by his directors. His natural ability to depict any character while making it all look so easy as though he has been the Commissioner all his life, is truly the showcasing of India's finer talents. We have seen his astounding serious side in films like Saaransh, Kaash, Parinda, Daddy, Veer Zaara and Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Maara (list may not be comprehensive). Yes, about 6 films in a career that spans over 275 are noteworthy serious character renditions. Talk about talent being wasted these days. Let us not even get to Naseeruddin Shah who very righteously had given up on good work from Bollywood once upon a time. But with A Wednesday, these two actors get a chance to showcase what they are and have overpowered every aspect of the movie. The film as such is well conceived with the common man's sufferings being depicted in a radical manner. The cat and mouse chase between the mastermind and Commissioner's team is a thrilling game that will engage you completely. A Wednesday is crisply edited with remarkable work on the script and screenplay that truly justified the talents in the film. Performances by the supporting cast including Jimmy Shergil and Aamir Bashir are excellent as well but Â…Â… yes there is a 'but'Â…...When you walk out of the theatre, it is the plot of the mastermind and the performance of these actors that you go home with. You will discuss these two aspects for days but what you won't really be talking about is the more technical aspect such as background score, which somehow sounds like a C.I.D episode, the cinematography, which is spectacular only from the terraces of buildings or the control room, which looks incredulous for it to be a part of Mumbai Police Headquarters. More like a set from C.I.D again. Even the overall look of the film could have been solidified to suit the otherwise intense atmosphere that builds up. These may be insignificant in comparison to the film's strengths but it somehow feels like it could've been better in its impact had the director focused on these details as well. Nevertheless, the film is very realistic in the dialogues between the characters and in the scripting of every situation. The final 20 minutes that include the great confrontational dialogue between the mastermind and the Commissioner are worth the full price of the ticket. The film belongs to Naseeruddin Shah though as he portrays his character in a definitive manner that is strikingly real like. The ease with which he renders dialogues, his body language, his expressions and his emotions in every situation are all traits of an outstanding talent and a Great actor that he is. The film is thought provoking and instigating as it portrays the dire circumstances that citizens of Bombay live in. The violence and uncertainty that have started controlling routine life can take a toll on the common man itself and that, is the message of this film. The other message is that film makers need to be free. They need to think openly about ideas and stories and cast the great talent we have in this industry without worrying about box-office success because if your product is good, the actors can make it even better and the audience has now accepted this reality and films like A Wednesday are getting an encouragement even from the masses and not just the classes. There are enough reasons indeed for that acceptance.9.11 on a scale of 1-10.",character bombay,numerous films have been based terrorism tragedy life bombay some have very serious realistic take it such as black friday mumbai meri jaan while some have been dramatized showcase another aspect terror such as dhoka aamir now debutant director neeraj pandey brings impactful thought provoking thriller wednesday which transcends through wavelengths cinemas sound system stir up frustrated citizen you all this happens through articulate voice superlative performance naseeruddin shah as anonymous mastermind who provokes police department with his threat bombing city 5 different locations masterminds plot builds up rapidly while all characters are introduced with his first phone call commissioner police anupam kher thrill ride begins true hollywood bad guy nypd style that includes fancy control room hi tech tracking units loads sophisticated equipment at helm it all is anupam kher gifted actor who has been neglected years has been subjected humiliating roles that do not suit his talent at all we need give all credit neeraj pandey just being bold enough direct this thriller with two finest actors indian cinema it is treat watch anupam kher serious character role rather than slapstick comedy we have been subjected by his directors his natural ability depict any character while making it all look so easy as though he has been commissioner all his life is truly showcasing indias finer talents we have seen his astounding serious side films like saaransh kaash parinda daddy veer zaara maine gandhi ko nahi maara list may not be comprehensive yes about 6 films career that spans over 275 are noteworthy serious character renditions talk about talent being wasted these days let us not even get naseeruddin shah who very righteously had given up good work bollywood once upon time but with wednesday these two actors get chance showcase what they are have overpowered every aspect movie film as such is well conceived with common mans sufferings being depicted radical manner cat mouse chase between mastermind commissioners team is thrilling game that will engage you completely wednesday is crisply edited with remarkable work script screenplay that truly justified talents film performances by supporting cast including jimmy shergil aamir bashir are excellent as well but yes there is but when you walk out theatre it is plot mastermind performance these actors that you go home with you will discuss these two aspects days but what you wont really be talking about is more technical aspect such as background score which somehow sounds like c i d episode cinematography which is spectacular only terraces buildings or control room which looks incredulous it be part mumbai police headquarters more like set c i d again even overall look film could have been solidified suit otherwise intense atmosphere that builds up these may be insignificant comparison films strengths but it somehow feels like it couldve been better its impact had director focused these details as well nevertheless film is very realistic dialogues between characters scripting every situation final 20 minutes that include great confrontational dialogue between mastermind commissioner are worth full price ticket film belongs naseeruddin shah though as he portrays his character definitive manner that is strikingly real like ease with which he renders dialogues his body language his expressions his emotions every situation are all traits outstanding talent great actor that he is film is thought provoking instigating as it portrays dire circumstances that citizens bombay live violence uncertainty that have started controlling routine life can take toll common man itself that is message this film other message is that film makers need be free they need think openly about ideas stories cast great talent we have this industry without worrying about box office success because if your product is good actors can make it even better audience has now accepted this reality films like wednesday are getting encouragement even masses not just classes there are enough reasons indeed that acceptance 9 11 scale 1 10,0.5591145833333333,0.18455255681818183,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9,Kudos to the fresh talent with new thoughts in Indian Cinema,"First of all I wish to thanks ""Mr. Ronnie Screwvala"" for being a unique producer who has the guts to back up projects like ""A Wednesday"". Secondly, Kudos to writer & director ""Neeraj Pandey"", who brings a fresh & new tide in the vast ocean of Hindi Cinema.""A Wednesday"" is not a big movie, but it is many times powerful than all the 50-70 crores projects being talked about in the news. It's a movie which shows the signs of intelligence and the art of film making flowing in the veins of our young directors. It's a movie made with courage, with conviction and with a strong point to raise in favor of a common man.Without giving away the main plot, the story is about confrontation between a man played by Naseeruddin Shah, who has planted bombs in the city and Anupam Kher, the Police Chief of the city. In simple words it's like fire between two stalwarts of our Hindi Cinema and they both make it just worth watching. I remember seeing two giants together on the screen last time in ""Saudagar"" (Dilip Kumar & Raj Kumar) and way back in ""Shakti"" (Dilip Kumar & Amitabh Bachhan). And like those two movies, this one too satisfied my expectations to a large extent.Though the movie starts with some predictable scenes of planting bombs in public areas. But after this weak start, the moment first phone call goes to the office of Anupam Kher, the film is straight away in the top gear and never looks back. The script is strictly to the point and that takes the viewer to the edge of his seat with every passing minute. Many movie buffs may judge the main twist post interval but even after you have cracked it, the movie still has the grip to keep you glued to your seats.Performances have many surprises in store for the viewer. First of all, Jimmy Shergil is completely convincing and once again impressive in his act of an angry young police officer. The four terrorists and the entire supporting star cast has done a commendable job which makes you believe the unexpected happening on the screen. Cinematography and Background Music both completely support the vision of the director.Frankly speaking, the script has its flaws like what happened to the bag planted by Naseer at the station in the start of the movie. But these loopholes must be (essentially) ignored to enjoy one of the most powerful film of this year.The last 20 minutes need a special and standing ovation for both the director and the actors. The long, strong and impressive explanation by Naseer about his reasons is a kind of landmark in Hindi Movies. You will find each word, completely justifying our day to day experiences in life. You will feel that whatever may be the outcome, this man (Naseer) is somehow saying the right thing, which you may have felt at some moment in your life.The worth praising fact about the movie is that it doesn't take sides for any religion or its followers. There are references to some Hindu & Muslim characters, but they do not indicate any partiality on behalf of someone particular character. At many times, the silence of the actors, just says it all. And the best part is that the director refuses to tell the real name of the man causing all troubles in the end. And the narration says that ""If a name is given then it will lead to un-necessary conclusion, so let it be a common man who chose to fight for his own safety"". And that, in my opinion is the most unexpected and original climaxes you may have seen in a Hindi movie. A well written and fantastically executed climax scene, when both Naseer & Anupam shake hands and cross each other is simply excellent.The two volcanoes of talent, Naseer & Anupam Kher have nothing to prove about themselves, but they do prove one thing.....that we are not making much films which can tap the talent available in the country.Imagine Naseer in ""Jaane Tu...."" & Anupam Kher in ""C Kkompany"" after watching ""A Wednesday"". You will surely understand what I am trying to say. I also remember ""Nasser"" & ""Om Puri"" together in ""Maqbool"" in the same context.Coming back to the movie, ""A Wednesday"" certainly takes its place among the Top10 movies of both Naseeruddin Shah & Anupam Kher. And the director ""Neeraj Pandey"" is a talent to watch out in the coming future.An essential Watch, even at the cost of a holiday from your work.",kudos fresh talent with new thoughts indian cinema,first all i wish thanks mr ronnie screwvala being unique producer who has guts back up projects like wednesday secondly kudos writer director neeraj pandey who brings fresh new tide vast ocean hindi cinema wednesday is not big movie but it is many times powerful than all 50 70 crores projects being talked about news its movie which shows signs intelligence art film making flowing veins our young directors its movie made with courage with conviction with strong point raise favor common man without giving away main plot story is about confrontation between man played by naseeruddin shah who has planted bombs city anupam kher police chief city simple words its like fire between two stalwarts our hindi cinema they both make it just worth watching i remember seeing two giants together screen last time saudagar dilip kumar raj kumar way back shakti dilip kumar amitabh bachhan like those two movies this one too satisfied my expectations large extent though movie starts with some predictable scenes planting bombs public areas but after this weak start moment first phone call goes office anupam kher film is straight away top gear never looks back script is strictly point that takes viewer edge his seat with every passing minute many movie buffs may judge main twist post interval but even after you have cracked it movie still has grip keep you glued your seats performances have many surprises store viewer first all jimmy shergil is completely convincing once again impressive his act angry young police officer four terrorists entire supporting star cast has done commendable job which makes you believe unexpected happening screen cinematography background music both completely support vision director frankly speaking script has its flaws like what happened bag planted by naseer at station start movie but these loopholes must be essentially ignored enjoy one most powerful film this year last 20 minutes need special standing ovation both director actors long strong impressive explanation by naseer about his reasons is kind landmark hindi movies you will find each word completely justifying our day day experiences life you will feel that whatever may be outcome this man naseer is somehow saying right thing which you may have felt at some moment your life worth praising fact about movie is that it doesnt take sides any religion or its followers there are references some hindu muslim characters but they do not indicate any partiality behalf someone particular character at many times silence actors just says it all best part is that director refuses tell real name man causing all troubles end narration says that if name is given then it will lead un necessary conclusion so let it be common man who chose fight his own safety that my opinion is most unexpected original climaxes you may have seen hindi movie well written fantastically executed climax scene when both naseer anupam shake hands cross each other is simply excellent two volcanoes talent naseer anupam kher have nothing prove about themselves but they do prove one thing that we are not making much films which can tap talent available country imagine naseer jaane tu anupam kher c kkompany after watching wednesday you will surely understand what i am trying say i also remember nasser om puri together maqbool same context coming back movie wednesday certainly takes its place among top10 movies both naseeruddin shah anupam kher director neeraj pandey is talent watch out coming future essential watch even at cost holiday your work,0.48557805498594964,0.22119503303713825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9,A true Masterpiece !!!,"Think back....how many movies with the terrorists in focus or the bomb blasts have been made in the past few years !! I am sure you would not be disappointed by your memory :) Even a recluse can name a few, to say the least. Then where does this new movie ""A Wednesday "" strike a different chord ? Well the suspense is all out there for you to watch and figure out yourself !!.I have always firmly believed that there are more chances of a movie being a hit if the person who writes and conceptualizes it also directs it.The case here is the same.Debutant director Neeraj Pandey has done an excellent job. This is one of the best movies I have seen off late...the reason being that the movie is very fast paced and does not slack or slow down at any point.It engrosses the viewer in such a magical fashion that the intermission also seems irritating (you pray that it gets over soon)...The backdrop of the story is not something different but the way it has been presented simply leaves you spell-bound.Not to forget the wonderful acting by Naseeruddin Shah ,Anupam Kher,Jimmy Shergill and all the other characters.This is a complete entertainment package for viewers of all age groups and has been made very intelligently and meticulously (no loose strings in the story :) ) It is short (just 1hour 40 minutes) but truly a masterpiece !!! Go watch it :)",true masterpiece,think back how many movies with terrorists focus or bomb blasts have been made past few years i am sure you would not be disappointed by your memory even recluse can name few say least then where does this new movie wednesday strike different chord well suspense is all out there you watch figure out yourself i have always firmly believed that there are more chances movie being hit if person who writes conceptualizes it also directs it case here is same debutant director neeraj pandey has done excellent job this is one best movies i have seen off late reason being that movie is very fast paced does not slack or slow down at any point it engrosses viewer such magical fashion that intermission also seems irritating you pray that it gets over soon backdrop story is not something different but way it has been presented simply leaves you spell bound not forget wonderful acting by naseeruddin shah anupam kher jimmy shergill all other characters this is complete entertainment package viewers all age groups has been made very intelligently meticulously no loose strings story it is short just 1hour 40 minutes but truly masterpiece go watch it,0.4902717768342769,0.11575842560217559,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2,Ehm...movie about...people walking in a corridors?,"While I understand A Wednesday did some good job in heavy uplifting patriotism, is it enough for it to be placed into top 250? I do not think so. I see most of the reviews are a bit, how to put it, ""overly-benevolent"", I suppose written by people moved by the message.While movie have some interesting moments, it is slow paced, unimaginative, predictable, unrealistic and in my opinion, too long. Come on, I feel like 75% of all scenes was just a cops and politicians playing important while heroic music plays - that's it - good guys walking in a corridor (lot of corridors out there, believe me) and music, talking to a phone (you mostly cannot hear what they are saying) and music, waiting in a car and music, sitting, standing and so on. But the story was there, it just the movie should have been shorter by half. Occasional action is laughable. That is said, if you can call a scene of a some sort of cop beating some sort of thug into a pulp with his 90's midi sound waves superpower (checked, nobody came to any real harm for sure) an action. But short laugh usually came to end shortly afterwards, as some pretty nasty humiliating moments happened to the bad guys (they all are...bad guys...right?), which made me a bit sick (hooray - true emotion).So to wrap it up, it is a movie showing message of hatred to the bad guys. You hate them bad guys? Then it is a chance you will enjoy this movie. I know terrorism and stuff is a bad thing and so on - OK, but make a quality movie about it, then I bet it will be welcomed into top 250 with open arms.",ehm movie about people walking corridors,while i understand wednesday did some good job heavy uplifting patriotism is it enough it be placed into top 250 i do not think so i see most reviews are bit how put it overly benevolent i suppose written by people moved by message while movie have some interesting moments it is slow paced unimaginative predictable unrealistic my opinion too long come i feel like 75 all scenes was just cops politicians playing important while heroic music plays thats it good guys walking corridor lot corridors out there believe me music talking phone you mostly cannot hear what they are saying music waiting car music sitting standing so but story was there it just movie should have been shorter by half occasional action is laughable that is said if you can call scene some sort cop beating some sort thug into pulp with his 90s midi sound waves superpower checked nobody came any real harm sure action but short laugh usually came end shortly afterwards as some pretty nasty humiliating moments happened bad guys they all are bad guys right which made me bit sick hooray true emotion so wrap it up it is movie showing message hatred bad guys you hate them bad guys then it is chance you will enjoy this movie i know terrorism stuff is bad thing so ok but make quality movie about it then i bet it will be welcomed into top 250 with open arms,0.5538230739450252,0.004994192799070876,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"

1,The worst movie of the top 250,"What makes a good movie? I say a good movie should have good acting, good sound production, good camera work, good plot, be well directed and so on. What makes a ""top 250 grade"" movie? Wonderful acting, amazing sound production, astonishing camera work, really unique plot and to be directed by someone who has outstanding talent. And this movie isn't even good. Why? The only thing it has is some kind of a ""message"". Well, having a message is not enough. It doesn't have anything a movie should have. Acting is just awful, especially the fighting scenes. Music sounds out of place and cartoon punching sounds are just ridiculous. Camera work is strange. Plot is average, or slightly above. And i won't even say anything about the director.First of all, this movie looks like a cheap TV drama. And i know it has low budget. But making shots of a cat getting thrown from around the corner or ridiculous fighting scenes with cartoon sounds has nothing to do with money, it's a matter of taste. Those who made the movie just don't have it.Next, CGI. Yes, it does have it. But it would be much better if it didn't. Because showing the audience some strange black silhouettes unnaturally flying out of an explosion doesn't make the movie look more believable, it makes it laughable. Well, CGI costs money. Congratulations to the creators of the movie - they found the worst way to waste it. Because if you don't have enough money to do good special effects, you shouldn't probably do them at all.Also, introducing a superhero-cop character in a movie that is supposed to be an intense moderately realistic thriller with some drama mixed in wasn't such a good idea.So, as a result we have a movie that looks bad, sounds bad and feels bad. However, it's kinda useful - without it i would've never known what a really awful movie actually is. This one makes a great reference.I've never actually written a review before. And what made me do it is the fact that this movie somehow made it to the top 250. Believe me, it doesn't belong there. Just doesn't. It's a shame that some site users do not want to rate movies according to their quality, but rather use the flaws of the rating system to push movies from their country to the top just because they want to.",worst movie top 250,what makes good movie i say good movie should have good acting good sound production good camera work good plot be well directed so what makes top 250 grade movie wonderful acting amazing sound production astonishing camera work really unique plot be directed by someone who has outstanding talent this movie isnt even good why only thing it has is some kind message well having message is not enough it doesnt have anything movie should have acting is just awful especially fighting scenes music sounds out place cartoon punching sounds are just ridiculous camera work is strange plot is average or slightly above i wont even say anything about director first all this movie looks like cheap tv drama i know it has low budget but making shots cat getting thrown around corner or ridiculous fighting scenes with cartoon sounds has nothing do with money its matter taste those who made movie just dont have it next cgi yes it does have it but it would be much better if it didnt because showing audience some strange black silhouettes unnaturally flying out explosion doesnt make movie look more believable it makes it laughable well cgi costs money congratulations creators movie they found worst way waste it because if you dont have enough money do good special effects you shouldnt probably do them at all also introducing superhero cop character movie that is supposed be intense moderately realistic thriller with some drama mixed wasnt such good idea so as result we have movie that looks bad sounds bad feels bad however its kinda useful without it i wouldve never known what really awful movie actually is this one makes great reference ive never actually written review before what made me do it is fact that this movie somehow made it top 250 believe me it doesnt belong there just doesnt its shame that some site users do not want rate movies according their quality but rather use flaws rating system push movies their country top just because they want,0.5591071428571429,0.14609126984126983,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.23}"

7,Surprisingly interesting...,"""A Wednesday"" is a Crime - Mystery movie in which we watch a man calling in a police department to inform them that he placed five bombs in five different locations and he is willing to give them those locations if they let free four terrorists in exchange. He is a simple and ordinary man who wants to make this deal.I really liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot with many plot twists that kept me alert in the whole duration of it. I also liked the interpretations of Naseeruddin Shah who played as The Common Man and Anupam Kher who played as Prakash Rathod. Another interesting interpretation was Jimmy Sheirgill who played as Arif Khan. The direction which was made by Neeraj Pandey was exceptional except some scenes with some unnecessary slow motions.Lastly, I have to say that ""A Wednesday"" is a very interesting movie and I am sure that you will enjoy it and you will discuss it with your friends.
