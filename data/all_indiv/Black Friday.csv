,A Haunting Friday,"'Black Friday' is horrifyingly raw. It's overwhelmingly dark. It's frighteningly real. It's daringly gritty and graphic. Anurag Kashyap's film is one of the most skillfully executed movies of recent times. A great screenplay, strong light effects, the use of color, the direction, the performances, the background score work together very effectively. The cinematography, whether the shaky camera, the zooming or the closeup shots, works brilliantly. 'Black Friday' is slick (but not so much as to take away from the realness). Actors Kay Kay Menon, Aditya Shrivastava and Pavan Malhotra do an excellent job in the acting department.Based on Hussain Zaidi's book of the same title, 'Black Friday' revolves around the investigation of the infamous Bombay blasts (after which Bombay became Mumbai) in the early 90s. The movie opens with a 'boom' and from then on the intricate investigation proceeds. As the trial was still in process, Kashyap had to wait years before his movie could finally release in 2007. The director deserves credit for bravely making a film on such a serious and risky subject.However, it does have the documentary feel. Kashyap breaks the film into chapters and this gave the feeling that one was watching a documentary series. The pace isn't steady because the film does drag at certain points.'Black Friday' is a brave well-made film and it is one that should be watched. Not everyone might like it but on some level they may appreciate it.",haunting friday,black friday is horrifyingly raw its overwhelmingly dark its frighteningly real its daringly gritty graphic anurag kashyaps film is one most skillfully executed movies recent times great screenplay strong light effects use color direction performances background score work together very effectively cinematography whether shaky camera zooming or closeup shots works brilliantly black friday is slick but not so much as take away realness actors kay kay menon aditya shrivastava pavan malhotra do excellent job acting department based hussain zaidis book same title black friday revolves around investigation infamous bombay blasts after which bombay became mumbai early 90s movie opens with boom then intricate investigation proceeds as trial was still process kashyap had wait years before his movie could finally release 2007 director deserves credit bravely making film such serious risky subject however it does have documentary feel kashyap breaks film into chapters this gave feeling that one was watching documentary series pace isnt steady because film does drag at certain points black friday is brave well made film it is one that should be watched not everyone might like it but some level they may appreciate it,0.5035431480284421,0.10775048480930836,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,Heartbreakingly True.,"This is not only a film. It's a lesson. It's a message. It's cruelly true history. It's an initiative. It's an attempt. It's a bold step, forward. It's known yet untold bare truth. And after all it's a film.No doubt the film opens old wounds, but only to find the root cause of it, only to find cure for them, only to make sure they are eradicated and never surface again. The film presents the hard facts about the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai (then Bombay). The film gives a new dimension to real life cinema, with real name, real incidents, and real people. The usage of actual news footage of the incidents make you believe whatever you are watching. It takes courage to take names of some of the biggest name in underworld and Indian politics as bluntly, and the filmmaker shows that courage. The story doesn't point finger on any particular person, group or community as the culprit for what is still Indian crime history's biggest tragedy. It tries to make a point how some clever minds make their business out of our religious sentiments, at the cost of lives of common men. Men who are common in every sense of it. The terror, the attacks, the explosions, the riots inhales not any particular community but the whole humanity.Director churns out a stunning effort. Technically too the film is impeccable. The blast sequences couldn't have got any more realistic. Each actor performs his character to full honesty, but Badshah Khan and Tiger Memon stand out.And before you jump to your own conclusion to decide the culprit(s), to decide the fate of them, the film concludes with the quote that says it all.An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.A must watch.",heartbreakingly true,this is not only film its lesson its message its cruelly true history its initiative its attempt its bold step forward its known yet untold bare truth after all its film no doubt film opens old wounds but only find root cause it only find cure them only make sure they are eradicated never surface again film presents hard facts about 1993 serial bomb blasts mumbai then bombay film gives new dimension real life cinema with real name real incidents real people usage actual news footage incidents make you believe whatever you are watching it takes courage take names some biggest name underworld indian politics as bluntly filmmaker shows that courage story doesnt point finger any particular person group or community as culprit what is still indian crime historys biggest tragedy it tries make point how some clever minds make their business out our religious sentiments at cost lives common men men who are common every sense it terror attacks explosions riots inhales not any particular community but whole humanity director churns out stunning effort technically too film is impeccable blast sequences couldnt have got any more realistic each actor performs his character full honesty but badshah khan tiger memon stand out before you jump your own conclusion decide culprit s decide fate them film concludes with quote that says it all eye eye makes whole world blind must watch,0.5382872846108142,0.14396167557932263,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10.0,A rare foray by an Indian film maker into gritty real-life drama,"Films based on books are a rarity in India. Probably that accounts for the huge amount of movies without any coherent screenplay that India churns out. Black Friday, on the other hand, is an exception, which will make any film maker proud.The movie, revolving around the investigation following the horrifying Bombay bomb blasts, and also showing the perpetrators' lives just before and after the incident, took a long time to get through the Censor Board, and it's not difficult to imagine why once you have seen the movie. The movie tries to portray everything the way it actually happened, or at least as the book says it happened, and succeeds. Technically the movie is top league, compared to other Hindi movies, though the editing is choppy in places. The music, by Indian Ocean, is brilliant, and more importantly suits the plot. Despite the length of the movie the director never loses grip, and that's really commendable.I haven't seen Satya (and I am sorry for that), so I am not very familiar with Anurag Kashyap's work (though he also did the dialogues, I believe, for Yuva, which I have seen), but considering the smoke he generates with every movie, I knew there had to be some fire to it too. And Black Friday IS fiery! The movie doesn't ever try to be politically correct and the director is almost obsessed with showing everything - even the correct language - which shall make it unsuitable for family viewing.The actors, with Kay Kay (he should be getting awards for this one) and Aditya Srivastava worth special mention, do a very good job too, and I think many of them are of a theatre background, which ensures a high pedigree in Indian movies. Those familiar with Indian TV serials must have seen Srivastava in an eminently well-made series called 9 Malabar Hill from the late 90s, which also starred Pawan Malhotra. Srivastava has been seen in many other smaller roles in movies and TV serials since then, but that particular role had showed how good an actor he is, and it is proved here once more. Pawan Malhotra is also a known face in India's parallel cinema movement, though he is prone to overact at times. Kay Kay is one of the best actors to have hit the Indian screen in recent years, and brilliant performances aren't new to him.The movie is unique in the sense that it shows the life of a terrorist AFTER the blast and how he copes with all the pressures. Then there's the pressure faced by the investigators to get to the terrorist, but taking care at the same time that they don't harm innocent people in their zeal. When I saw in the credits that the movie was based on a book by a Muslim author, I started feeling that it was going to be a biased description of the atrocities of Mumbai police on innocent members of the Musilm community during the investigations. Such a thought process is shameful, but natural in India's circumstances. But surprisingly, and thankfully, the movie, and so I suppose the book too, is as objective as it could have been without appearing sympathetic to either of the parties.To finish off, this is one of those (very rare) movies that convince you that the future isn't all that bad for Hindi cinema. A must watch for all Hindi movie fans, and even those who normally don't watch Hindi movies because of the unrealistic gloss and song-and-dance routines.",rare foray by indian film maker into gritty real life drama,films based books are rarity india probably that accounts huge amount movies without any coherent screenplay that india churns out black friday other hand is exception which will make any film maker proud movie revolving around investigation following horrifying bombay bomb blasts also showing perpetrators lives just before after incident took long time get through censor board its not difficult imagine why once you have seen movie movie tries portray everything way it actually happened or at least as book says it happened succeeds technically movie is top league compared other hindi movies though editing is choppy places music by indian ocean is brilliant more importantly suits plot despite length movie director never loses grip thats really commendable i havent seen satya i am sorry that so i am not very familiar with anurag kashyaps work though he also did dialogues i believe yuva which i have seen but considering smoke he generates with every movie i knew there had be some fire it too black friday is fiery movie doesnt ever try be politically correct director is almost obsessed with showing everything even correct language which shall make it unsuitable family viewing actors with kay kay he should be getting awards this one aditya srivastava worth special mention do very good job too i think many them are theatre background which ensures high pedigree indian movies those familiar with indian tv serials must have seen srivastava eminently well made series called 9 malabar hill late 90s which also starred pawan malhotra srivastava has been seen many other smaller roles movies tv serials since then but that particular role had showed how good actor he is it is proved here once more pawan malhotra is also known face indias parallel cinema movement though he is prone overact at times kay kay is one best actors have hit indian screen recent years brilliant performances arent new him movie is unique sense that it shows life terrorist after blast how he copes with all pressures then theres pressure faced by investigators get terrorist but taking care at same time that they dont harm innocent people their zeal when i saw credits that movie was based book by muslim author i started feeling that it was going be biased description atrocities mumbai police innocent members musilm community during investigations such thought process is shameful but natural indias circumstances but surprisingly thankfully movie so i suppose book too is as objective as it could have been without appearing sympathetic either parties finish off this is one those very rare movies that convince you that future isnt all that bad hindi cinema must watch all hindi movie fans even those who normally dont watch hindi movies because unrealistic gloss song dance routines,0.5261654206009044,0.1712517589936945,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,are rukh jah re bandhe,"Mind blowing. Astounding. Astonishing. Superb. Enthralled. I could go on and put in all adjectives from the dictionary and even then I would still feel I need to say more. 1000 words isn't enough to write a review on Black Friday. Anurag Kashyap's foray into Bollywood was marred by the judiciary for more than 2 years, but finally the wait ended a few days back. And we were given the privilege to see the true potential of Indian film making. The topic was sensitive. Highly sensitive, one of the most tragic events in the last 3 decades in Indian history, an event which made Don Dawood Ibrahim as the #1 wanted man in India.Right from the beginning, the interrogation sequence where the prisoner confesses,""Sir, bombs are about to explode in the city sir"" Right from that word till the last scene where Tiger Memon says,""Mumbai mein dhamaka macha dega hum."" you are glued to your seat, wondering what will the director make you see next ? The casting for the movie was in my opinion perfect. One may criticize that Kay Kay Memon was underused, but in my opinion, he was just perfect. He wasn't given much screen appearance but whatever time he had, he brought everyone to their feet. His dialogs brought the entire theater applauding. Aditya Srivastava and Pawan Malhotra were equally good, if not better. Pawan Malhotra's portrayal of the underworld don Tiger Memon was just superb. Same goes for Aditya Srivastava's portrayal of Badshah Khan, the terrorist who turned as a police witness. His struggle to escape the country, from the clutches of Mumbai police was just marvelously portrayed. A person helplessly running around the country, lack of money, being chased around by an unknown force. And when mentioning the casting one cannot but ignore Vijay Maurya as the feared Dawood Ibrahim. He was given about a couple of minutes at maximum of screen presence but even in that minute period he brought a shiver up your spines.Black Friday is also a very good technical movie. The special effects used are pretty advanced and are at par with Hollywood. The script although adapted is superb. Every expression, dialog will make you feel for the characters in the movie.Just remember this isn't a movie about Hindus or Muslims. At first you feel for all the people getting killed by the blasts, but later when the riots are shown, then you feel for the Muslims as well. But this ain't a movie for any of the religious sentiments. Its about the society as a whole in those few years in Mumbai. This is the type of movie that India should send to Oscars and other film festivals/awards. The world should be made known that we can make movies that will claim fame and bring India to the global picture.10/10 !!!",are rukh jah re bandhe,mind blowing astounding astonishing superb enthralled i could go put all adjectives dictionary even then i would still feel i need say more 1000 words isnt enough write review black friday anurag kashyaps foray into bollywood was marred by judiciary more than 2 years but finally wait ended few days back we were given privilege see true potential indian film making topic was sensitive highly sensitive one most tragic events last 3 decades indian history event which made don dawood ibrahim as wanted man india right beginning interrogation sequence where prisoner confesses sir bombs are about explode city sir right that word till last scene where tiger memon says mumbai mein dhamaka macha dega hum you are glued your seat wondering what will director make you see next casting movie was my opinion perfect one may criticize that kay kay memon was underused but my opinion he was just perfect he wasnt given much screen appearance but whatever time he had he brought everyone their feet his dialogs brought entire theater applauding aditya srivastava pawan malhotra were equally good if not better pawan malhotras portrayal underworld don tiger memon was just superb same goes aditya srivastavas portrayal badshah khan terrorist who turned as police witness his struggle escape country clutches mumbai police was just marvelously portrayed person helplessly running around country lack money being chased around by unknown force when mentioning casting one cannot but ignore vijay maurya as feared dawood ibrahim he was given about couple minutes at maximum screen presence but even that minute period he brought shiver up your spines black friday is also very good technical movie special effects used are pretty advanced are at par with hollywood script although adapted is superb every expression dialog will make you feel characters movie just remember this isnt movie about hindus or muslims at first you feel all people getting killed by blasts but later when riots are shown then you feel muslims as well but this aint movie any religious sentiments its about society as whole those few years mumbai this is type movie that india should send oscars other film festivals awards world should be made known that we can make movies that will claim fame bring india global picture 10 10,0.5332867494824018,0.23543995859213251,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10.0,Arguably the greatest Indian movie ever made...,"I remember watching the trailers of Black Friday a couple of years ago and making it a point to watch it.Never before has anyone dared to approach such a controversial issue so blatantly,which is probably why it worked.The events that are depicted in this movie shook not only the city of Bombay but the nation as a whole.To add to the documentary-like look at the blasts of '93,director Anurag Kashyap has done a brilliant job of elucidating moving,intense performances from fine actors like Kay Kay Menon and Aditya Srivastava. Technically, Black Friday is more visionary than most Hindi movies ever made.It did not have exotic locations,an ensemble star cast of the most high profile actors in the industry,or an unlimited budget,all of which are necessities for an Indian movie.The use of complex Steadicam shots,slow motion and hand-held cameras really put the movie into a different perspective.The use of lighting in situations such as the interrogations being bathed in red light also helped set the mood required to really go into the depths of all the stories of the main characters which have been intricately woven together with finesse. Hats off to Mr. Anurag Kashyap for bringing such a fine piece of art to Indian cinema.Seems like the time spent with Mr. Mani Ratnam,the greatest Indian director ever to get behind a camera,is paying off.This is evident in the tinge of patriotism and realism portrayed.Personally i hope guys with vision like this continue bringing quality to Indian cinema.It really needs it.",arguably greatest indian movie ever made,i remember watching trailers black friday couple years ago making it point watch it never before has anyone dared approach such controversial issue so blatantly which is probably why it worked events that are depicted this movie shook not only city bombay but nation as whole add documentary like look at blasts 93 director anurag kashyap has done brilliant job elucidating moving intense performances fine actors like kay kay menon aditya srivastava technically black friday is more visionary than most hindi movies ever made it did not have exotic locations ensemble star cast most high profile actors industry or unlimited budget all which are necessities indian movie use complex steadicam shots slow motion hand held cameras really put movie into different perspective use lighting situations such as interrogations being bathed red light also helped set mood required really go into depths all stories main characters which have been intricately woven together with finesse hats off mr anurag kashyap bringing such fine piece art indian cinema seems like time spent with mr mani ratnam greatest indian director ever get behind camera is paying off this is evident tinge patriotism realism portrayed personally i hope guys with vision like this continue bringing quality indian cinema it really needs it,0.5188235294117646,0.1860784313725491,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,"""Black Friday"" caught up with so many controversies, that many in Mumbai never thought that it would ever see the light of the day.Now almost 2 years after the date on which it was slated to release,does it live up to its expectations? well, it surely does and how!!!It is not a movie to take the family to on a Sunday afternoon, nor is it an ""entertaining"" popcorn extravaganza. ""Black Friday"" is amongst the best films Indian cinema has ever produced, but it is not a movie for everyone. I had my fair share of disappointments, and I think many audiences will walk away unsatisfied by its documentary-like style and unusual structure. The movie based on the book of Hussain Zaidi, tracks the investigation that takes place followed by the dreadful Bombay serial bomb blast in '93. the foray of the Indian cinema into investigative journalism is splendid to say the least. what makes the film a lot more riveting is the fact that it is not afraid to take names of all those involved in the conspiracy. Hence it has mixed up with a myriad of controversies. For this alone the directors and producers should be applauded for sticking their neck out.The music by Indian ocean gives the movie a life of its own and especially in the final blast scene the eerie noise that is made is something that can just be experienced in the theaters. The screenplay with its tautness effectively delivers the movie and third person view which it assumes adds another shade to the movie as a whole. Finally the editing does seem to be a tad bit less crisp towards the end but still especially in the first half it is just perfect.The usage of cranial cameras to capture the top views of Mumbai or the monochromatic shots during the investigation is a pleasure to watch. In fact using the metaphor of a dog to capture the melancholy withing Badshaah Khan's head is simply marvelous to watch. The acting throughout the movie is par excellence and the uncanny resemblance to Dawood Ibrahim is amongst the other reasons why this movie is a must watch for any one.Finally this movie with the focus on Bombay Bomb blast has covered lots of issues including the stress on the Police during investigation along with the perspectives from all sides. Yet towards the end the message remains global that to stop shedding innocent blood in the name of religion for those who are caught in this web are none but jobless ch#$&@as as so correctly pointed out by Inspector.Rakesh Maria.

10.0,Anurag Kashyap's adaptation of S. Hussain Zaidi non-fiction novel Black Friday – The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts.,"Since having somehow forgotten about picking up the film after seeing the DVD being priced at outrageous amounts a few years ago,I was pleased to recently be reminded about the movie from a fellow IMDber,who told me that this was a modern classic that I really needed to catch up to.Prepairing to start searching for the title later that night,I thrillingly found my plans to surprisingly be stopped in their tracks,thanks to a friend telling me that he had recently signed up to an online DVD rental service called Love Film,and that the very first title that was right at the top of his list for films to rent,was Black Friday.The plot:India-1993:Investigating 12 bomb sites in the hope of finding any evidence on either the people or the group that coordinated the attacks,a bomb squad is alerted by a resident in a near by tower block that he has spotted a scooter,which has been parked unattended outside the flats.Carefully opening the scooter,the squad discover that the scooter is filled with explosives,that only failed to go off,thanks to the explosives jamming up the detonator mechanic's.Checking up on the registration details for the scooter and an explosives-filled van,that mysteriously seems to have been left undetonated at the very last moment,a group of Anti Terrorist Squiad police officers, lead by Deputy Commisonar Rakesh Maria uncover the address's that the owners of the van ans scooter are said to be located at.Raiding the location,Rakesh is furious to discover that underworld drug smuggler ""Tiger"" Memon was a resident of the building until one day ago,when he suddenly ""disappeared"".Furious over Memon going deep into cover the moment that the attacks began,Maria starts to franticly search for anyone who has even the slightest connection to ""Tiger"",in the hope of digging out Memon and the other surviving gang members involved in the attacks,along with trying to fully unravel the motives that caused the attack to take place.View on the film:Frozen in time for 2 years after filming by the Indian high court,due to the real life court case of the 1993 Bombay bomb blasts taking place,the screenplay by writer/ director Anurag Kashyap,inspired by S. Hussain Zaidi non-fiction novel Black Friday – The True Story of the Bombay Bomb Blasts reveals that time has been unable to fan the flames of the passionate fire contained within the movie.Bravely keeping away from taking the easy route of siding with either the police or terrorist,and tearing any potential falls into melodrama into shreds,Kashyap plants his feet right in the centre of the horrific Bombay blasts and the percussing 1992 riots,and uses brittle,to the bone dialogue to show in an unflinching vision that chaos becomes a never ending cycle of chaos and death.Separating the 1992-1994 period into overlapping chapters,Kashyap matches his brilliantly brittle dialogue by staying away from any exposition,by instead putting the viewer right in the middle of the characters lives and intelligently allowing for the viewer to make their own full picture of the events depicted in the movie,from a riot that is shown later in the film,which is connected to the riot that a suspected terrorist mentions in a snippet of dialogue right at the beginning,to the contrasting amount of focus that the police put into investigating the 1992 riots,with the 1993 bombings.Elaborating on the multi-threaded,precise nature of the screenplay with his dazzling directing,Anurag Kashyap and cinematography Nataraja Subramanian uses red,blue,yellow and green filters to give the film an extraordinary intense atmosphere,with the red filer giving the police interrogation scenes an extremely gritty,smoking hot feeling,as the police's frustrations over failing to gather evidence for the location of Tiger Memon,boils over into the manner that they treat the people suspected of collaborating with Tiger. Along with the clever use of a red filter for the police interrogation's scenes,Kashyap uses a yellow filter for the scenes between Tiger Memon,the collaborator's of the 1993 bombing and the victims of the 1992 riots,which along with giving the scenes a real grittiness also creates a strong raw feeling of the wounds that the victims of the 1992 riots have been left with,that are impossible to ever become healed.Showing the real cost of the events depicted in the movie,Kashyap closely works with editor Aarti Bajaj to inject the film with moments of archive footage,which along with showing the real people behind the events,also gives the viewer a terrifying glimpse of what actually took place,which leads to Black Friday being a film that no viewer will ever forget.",anurag kashyaps adaptation s hussain zaidi non fiction novel black friday true story bombay bomb blasts,since having somehow forgotten about picking up film after seeing dvd being priced at outrageous amounts few years ago i was pleased recently be reminded about movie fellow imdber who told me that this was modern classic that i really needed catch up prepairing start searching title later that night i thrillingly found my plans surprisingly be stopped their tracks thanks friend telling me that he had recently signed up online dvd rental service called love film that very first title that was right at top his list films rent was black friday plot india 1993 investigating 12 bomb sites hope finding any evidence either people or group that coordinated attacks bomb squad is alerted by resident near by tower block that he has spotted scooter which has been parked unattended outside flats carefully opening scooter squad discover that scooter is filled with explosives that only failed go off thanks explosives jamming up detonator mechanics checking up registration details scooter explosives filled van that mysteriously seems have been left undetonated at very last moment group anti terrorist squiad police officers lead by deputy commisonar rakesh maria uncover addresss that owners van ans scooter are said be located at raiding location rakesh is furious discover that underworld drug smuggler tiger memon was resident building until one day ago when he suddenly disappeared furious over memon going deep into cover moment that attacks began maria starts franticly search anyone who has even slightest connection tiger hope digging out memon other surviving gang members involved attacks along with trying fully unravel motives that caused attack take place view film frozen time 2 years after filming by indian high court due real life court case 1993 bombay bomb blasts taking place screenplay by writer director anurag kashyap inspired by s hussain zaidi non fiction novel black friday true story bombay bomb blasts reveals that time has been unable fan flames passionate fire contained within movie bravely keeping away taking easy route siding with either police or terrorist tearing any potential falls into melodrama into shreds kashyap plants his feet right centre horrific bombay blasts percussing 1992 riots uses brittle bone dialogue show unflinching vision that chaos becomes never ending cycle chaos death separating 1992 1994 period into overlapping chapters kashyap matches his brilliantly brittle dialogue by staying away any exposition by instead putting viewer right middle characters lives intelligently allowing viewer make their own full picture events depicted movie riot that is shown later film which is connected riot that suspected terrorist mentions snippet dialogue right at beginning contrasting amount focus that police put into investigating 1992 riots with 1993 bombings elaborating multi threaded precise nature screenplay with his dazzling directing anurag kashyap cinematography nataraja subramanian uses red blue yellow green filters give film extraordinary intense atmosphere with red filer giving police interrogation scenes extremely gritty smoking hot feeling as polices frustrations over failing gather evidence location tiger memon boils over into manner that they treat people suspected collaborating with tiger along with clever use red filter police interrogations scenes kashyap uses yellow filter scenes between tiger memon collaborators 1993 bombing victims 1992 riots which along with giving scenes real grittiness also creates strong raw feeling wounds that victims 1992 riots have been left with that are impossible ever become healed showing real cost events depicted movie kashyap closely works with editor aarti bajaj inject film with moments archive footage which along with showing real people behind events also gives viewer terrifying glimpse what actually took place which leads black friday being film that no viewer will ever forget,0.5109417165113368,0.08603908749478366,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10.0,I remember...,"I remember being there... I remember landing up at tuitions on 6th December 1992 and waiting for my friends to turn up, friends who lived very near the area most affected by the riots... I remember hearing that riots have broken out because the Babri Masjid has been demolished... I remember passing that week hidden behind blackened windows and Bombay looking like a dead city, my hysterical mother not even letting us children go down to the street to play. I remember the undercurrent of tension amongst communal solidarity between the hindus and muslims even where the riots did not reach.I remember 6th January 1993 even more clearly, A day when worried parents gathered out in the school football ground to pick up their children, Riots had broken out again. I remember my driver maneuvering the car expertly through bylanes and little side roads, protecting us kids from angry, approaching mobs, mobs who would not differentiate between hindu and Muslim, child or adult... all they wanted was blood.Even at fifteen, I knew that the January riots were political, not communal. The politicians of the day had seized the opportunity to make their power plays, giving it a communal twist, and the uneducated, scared or frustrated (sometimes all-three) common man fell for it and became part of it.I remember joining a charitable organization and handing out food to what seemed to be millions of people who had lost their homes and families. sitting at VT station.And I remember the 12th of March 1993 clearer than anything. I was in school, and the sound of what was probably the century Bazaar blast tore through the air in the afternoon, in the middle of the exam hall. It was the last day of the 10th Standard Board exams, And we didn't know what the sound was, Someone made a joke for me to stop farting...It was only when we got out of school that we heard about the blasts. All sorts of news started filtering in, but we didn't know exactly what the magnitude of the attack was, until we got home that is. When I got home, all the windows of our living room were broken, just from the shock waves of the Air India Building blast.The following few months were spent in dread, looking over our shoulders. Even then I knew that this was in retaliation to the riots, And even then we were looking for answers. We waited, making heroes out of policemen, and martyrs of the common people who died that day, waiting for some kind of answer, some justification to the madness.Now, fourteen years hence, The film comes along and reminds me of how big in magnitude the attack actually was, and how it had impacted my mind forever.When I had heard of the film being banned, I was sad, I had heard so much about Anurag Kashyap, but the censor board seemed to hate him, not allowing any film of his to be released. From the day I heard that he was making this film, I had wanted to see it. And I am glad I did.The film gave me personally a sense of some kind of answers, some sense of what happened, and why it happened. It was directed with panache, precise and to the point, without resorting to jingoism and anti-communal will. All it did was present what is now believed to be fact in a format that comes together superbly. Brisk editing, masterful direction, and real, earthy performances. It is exactly how a film should be made. A special mention should go to the real hero of the film, Mumbai City, always a picture of resilience and strength, and the film shows that. Despite the blasts, the riots and all the Chaos, Mumbai moves on, and thats what the city does to its people as well. Gives them a strength that can only be understood if you spend some time living in the city.If only the powers that be wake up, take notice, and put their money behind Anurag Kashyap, so that he can go on to make more Cinema that can put India on the map.",i remember,i remember being there i remember landing up at tuitions 6th december 1992 waiting my friends turn up friends who lived very near area most affected by riots i remember hearing that riots have broken out because babri masjid has been demolished i remember passing that week hidden behind blackened windows bombay looking like dead city my hysterical mother not even letting us children go down street play i remember undercurrent tension amongst communal solidarity between hindus muslims even where riots did not reach i remember 6th january 1993 even more clearly day when worried parents gathered out school football ground pick up their children riots had broken out again i remember my driver maneuvering car expertly through bylanes little side roads protecting us kids angry approaching mobs mobs who would not differentiate between hindu muslim child or adult all they wanted was blood even at fifteen i knew that january riots were political not communal politicians day had seized opportunity make their power plays giving it communal twist uneducated scared or frustrated sometimes all three common man fell it became part it i remember joining charitable organization handing out food what seemed be millions people who had lost their homes families sitting at vt station i remember 12th march 1993 clearer than anything i was school sound what was probably century bazaar blast tore through air afternoon middle exam hall it was last day 10th standard board exams we didnt know what sound was someone made joke me stop farting it was only when we got out school that we heard about blasts all sorts news started filtering but we didnt know exactly what magnitude attack was until we got home that is when i got home all windows our living room were broken just shock waves air india building blast following few months were spent dread looking over our shoulders even then i knew that this was retaliation riots even then we were looking answers we waited making heroes out policemen martyrs common people who died that day waiting some kind answer some justification madness now fourteen years hence film comes along reminds me how big magnitude attack actually was how it had impacted my mind forever when i had heard film being banned i was sad i had heard so much about anurag kashyap but censor board seemed hate him not allowing any film his be released day i heard that he was making this film i had wanted see it i am glad i did film gave me personally sense some kind answers some sense what happened why it happened it was directed with panache precise point without resorting jingoism anti communal will all it did was present what is now believed be fact format that comes together superbly brisk editing masterful direction real earthy performances it is exactly how film should be made special mention should go real hero film mumbai city always picture resilience strength film shows that despite blasts riots all chaos mumbai moves thats what city does its people as well gives them strength that can only be understood if you spend some time living city if only powers that be wake up take notice put their money behind anurag kashyap so that he can go make more cinema that can put india map,0.48007020757020763,0.03225808913308914,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9.0,Well worth seeing...and based on a true event,"This film begins with the famous Gandhi quote ""An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind"".In 1993, a series of 12 bombs went off during Ramadan all over Mumbai (Bombay) which killed 257 people (thought the film often says it's 300 plus). This film is about this event as well as the subsequent police investigation of it. It's all based on true events but is rather critical of the police, and as a result the film was banned in India for two years before the government eventually allowed its release. The film begins with a man under arrest pleading for the police to believe him that a group was planning on burning the Mumbai Stock Exchange. Foolishly, the police just dismiss this and soon you see bombs detonating all over the city. All this occurs in the first few minutes of the film and what follows is a step by step documentary style investigation. How the police captured and interrogated suspects (and tortured them in some), how the mastermind of the bombings abandoned his minions and how the events are all in context, as this springs from previous attacks in which hundreds of Muslims were murdered--and this makes the quote from Gandhi at the beginning of the film quite appropriate. Overall, this is a very hard film to watch in places (such as the scene where the police use a hammer on one suspect's hand) but is also very well made and unflinching. And, unlike a typical Bollywood film, it lacks the song and dance numbers and just concentrates on telling the story.By the way, I did some checking and as of today, one ringleader was arrested and sentenced to death (he was executed two years ago). Two main ringleaders are still being sought by the Indian government.",well worth seeing based true event,this film begins with famous gandhi quote eye eye only ends up making whole world blind 1993 series 12 bombs went off during ramadan all over mumbai bombay which killed 257 people thought film often says its 300 plus this film is about this event as well as subsequent police investigation it its all based true events but is rather critical police as result film was banned india two years before government eventually allowed its release film begins with man under arrest pleading police believe him that group was planning burning mumbai stock exchange foolishly police just dismiss this soon you see bombs detonating all over city all this occurs first few minutes film what follows is step by step documentary style investigation how police captured interrogated suspects tortured them some how mastermind bombings abandoned his minions how events are all context as this springs previous attacks which hundreds muslims were murdered this makes quote gandhi at beginning film quite appropriate overall this is very hard film watch places such as scene where police use hammer one suspects hand but is also very well made unflinching unlike typical bollywood film it lacks song dance numbers just concentrates telling story by way i did some checking as today one ringleader was arrested sentenced death he was executed two years ago two main ringleaders are still being sought by indian government,0.39791666666666664,0.052462121212121196,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.47}"
10.0,"A bold, fantastic and path-breaking film","Anurag Kashyap's film 'Black Friday' is quite possibly the most important film of 2007, and as relevant today as it was two years ago when it was banned.Based on the book by S Hussain Zaidi, the film shows the events that led up to, and followed the serial blasts that shook Mumbai on 12th March 1993 from three very interestingly chosen points of view - The mastermind (Tiger Memon), the unsuspecting, misguided foot soldier (Badshah Khan), and the hapless and under-equipped police (Rakesh Maria).The film follows an episodic format, and keeps jumping in time and location quite regularly. However, kudos to Anurag Kashyap, for his taut screenplay and brilliant direction, and to Aarti Bajaj for her dexterous editing, that make sure you don't lose track of the goings on. The performances are top notch, be it Pavan Malhotra as the scheming, vengeful and manipulative Tiger Memon, Aaditya Srivastava as the misled, disillusioned jehadi Badshah Khan, or K.K Menon as Commissioner of Police Rakesh Maria, who manages to convey more about the rigors and moral dilemmas of a police officer through his eyes than most talented actors can with the best of dialogues. The dialogue is so fantastic in its realism that you almost feel like you're watching a documentary. Action, set design and sound are among the best yet, (remember they were done more than 2 years ago) and give the film a very troublingly real look.An all round masterpiece, this film deserves to be seen by one and all, not just because of its cinematic brilliance, but also for its relevance in today's troubled times.But I do have one grouse. How can the censor board allow words like Madar**** and Bhen**** in a film like Omkara and bleep the same words in Black Friday?

10.0,Hats-off to such a brilliant film-making in current film industry,"I just watched Black Friday last night at home and didn't feel like missing a single scene or even a shot of the movie. I was totally concentrated and lost in this movie. I felt how a genuine, appreciable and real effort can go wasted on box office. Such movies should run well even on box office as well as in award functions.Kay Kay Menon is one of my favorite actor as well as Pavan Malhotra in his intense role playing. Hats off again to this movie from 1st scene to last one. The sequence of Badshah Khan moving Rampur to Jaipur to Kolkata and back to Rampur is truly worth-watching. I know this movie didn't mean to earn profits or a MASALA FLICK that's why it became a serious cinema and worth watching.Anurag Kashyap has really done a brilliant and hard-hitting job. I wanted to see this movie from the moment I came to knowledge about it. I really enjoyed every moment though I found there were many censor cuts during the movie and BEEP tones during bad words speaking. Anurag made it hardcore real.I am not here to reveal or tell the story as it will spoil concentration and excitement of the watchers who didn't watch this movie yet. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND BY BEING A REAL MOVIE-WATCHER TO SEE THIS MOVIE ANY WAY YOU CAN GET IT.I learned that because of politicians' dirty plays, games and just because of their selfishness such incidences happens frequently in our country and which interrupts India to move further progressively. Such degressing tact, cheats and bad intentions of our politicians ruins peace between 2 religions and whatever they do they do just for their own benefit. How many innocent people were killed during such riots and blasts that's nightmarish thought and DID THIS POLITICIANS EVER THINK ABOUT THEIR INNOCENT FAMILIES WHILE PLANNING SUCH THINGS? My anger is purely towards THE POLITICIANS not to any Hindu or Muslim. Now our young generation must come up with their new ideas, intelligence and unity to fail such bad and dishonest intentions of Indian POLITICIANS.BLACK Friday is most worth watching that's all.",hats off such brilliant film making current film industry,i just watched black friday last night at home didnt feel like missing single scene or even shot movie i was totally concentrated lost this movie i felt how genuine appreciable real effort can go wasted box office such movies should run well even box office as well as award functions kay kay menon is one my favorite actor as well as pavan malhotra his intense role playing hats off again this movie 1st scene last one sequence badshah khan moving rampur jaipur kolkata back rampur is truly worth watching i know this movie didnt mean earn profits or masala flick thats why it became serious cinema worth watching anurag kashyap has really done brilliant hard hitting job i wanted see this movie moment i came knowledge about it i really enjoyed every moment though i found there were many censor cuts during movie beep tones during bad words speaking anurag made it hardcore real i am not here reveal or tell story as it will spoil concentration excitement watchers who didnt watch this movie yet i strongly recommend by being real movie watcher see this movie any way you can get it i learned that because politicians dirty plays games just because their selfishness such incidences happens frequently our country which interrupts india move further progressively such degressing tact cheats bad intentions our politicians ruins peace between 2 religions whatever they do they do just their own benefit how many innocent people were killed during such riots blasts thats nightmarish thought did this politicians ever think about their innocent families while planning such things my anger is purely towards politicians not any hindu or muslim now our young generation must come up with their new ideas intelligence unity fail such bad dishonest intentions indian politicians black friday is most worth watching thats all,0.46662958954625616,0.05355038480038483,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10.0,The Brilliance of Indian Cinema,"Mr. Anurag Kashyap,Take a bow! Black Friday is sincerely the greatest piece of cinematic magic to be released ever. You and your team have produced cinema of the highest quality, raised the notch by a few miles and used this medium like never before, hats off to you sir!I must admit that I am slightly biased toward your film because I have been born and brought up in Bombay and on March 12, 1993 (the day of the serial blasts) was just 8 years old. As Salman Rushdie famously calls children born during the era of Indian Independence as ""Midnight Children"", i would like to say we are but ""Blast Children"". Children whose innocence has been shattered mercilessly by the underworld and extremists from every religion and you have portrayed just that in your film. The film does not hype terrorism or romanticize the darkness of Bombay or the coldness of its police like many other so called underworld films do but portrays exactly what happens in reality, the human side. Sir, your film has merged the very shady line between cinematic magic, fiction and reality to an intoxicating mix of actuality.Pawan Malhotra (Tiger Memon), Kay Kay (Rakesh Maria) and Aditya Srivastava (Badhshah Khan) do not act, they live and breathe the very sentiments of these real life people. As a viewing audience I never once felt like I was watching a film, but felt like a 'fly on the wall' as the plot unfolds before your very eyes, the very same helplessness as Mumbaikars felt on that very day of the bomb blasts. The music by Indian Ocean is outstanding, it flows as easily as your reel does and blends so very brilliantly with the script. The cold chill that trickles down your spine as Dawood Ibrahim is shown in his mansion in Dubai is breathtaking. The authenticity of Bombay and its various locations from fast food restaurants in Bandra to the passport office in Worli is worth many many accolades. Mr. Kashyap, this film has struck the very chord of life in cinema once more. I'm sure everybody who watches it will share similar sentiments as I do. I am glad that the 2 year dustbin wait for your film did not deter you from eventually getting it released. You are not alone sir, the world supports your work with open arms.

9.0,Black Friday: One of the darkest films of Indian cinema!,"Anurag Kashyap is a talented director who often explores the dark side of the world in his movies. When I randomly came across this film when it was being aired on TV, I watched it. I was shocked to find that it was based on real events and almost nothing was fictionalized. BLACK FRIDAY is a shocking, heartbreaking and haunting crime saga which is as thrilling as it is emotional.BLACK FRIDAY is a very dark film to the core, though there are a few naturally funny moments too. It's not a film for the faint of heart. The film is replete with violence, expletives and horrifying sequences, and it does complete justice to its subject. There are a lot of characters, and they are so realistically portrayed that you'll both love and hate them from time to time.The film doesn't glorify crime in any way, and instead condemns it in the best possible way. Some dialogues are really hard-hitting and memorable enough to be remembered forever. The usage of music throughout the film is excellent; it never hinders the film's pace. The action sequences are filmed very well, and add a haunting depth to the film. The cinematography adds a very realistic touch to the film as well.The climax left me speechless and breathless, plus the rolling title credits accompanied by a dark and haunting song broke my heart into many pieces.BLACK FRIDAY is a brilliantly made film, and there are no two opinions on this.

It also puts light on the criminals involved and how justice was obtained.I would like to talk about other factors that came to my mind while watching the movie.Consider love of people belonging to Islam. It is great. During the month of Ramzan (18+1+13+26+1+14) it can be seen in their fasting. Only because of few of them going along the wrong path entire community should not be questioned. When I turned to Atheism I felt most appropriate religion to be that of Islam. I mean somebody coming into dreams and all that. Today I am again not an atheist, I feel what we are presented is stretched a lot in religious texts. A movie came 'Exodus: Gods and kings' where events are drawn the way how they could have been in reality (not stretched).It is really commendable Anurag Kashyap brings this sort of cinema to see for general public.Consider the heinous crime of rape, I don't understand how it is possible to have sex with someone when they are not psychologically involved. Thus I conclude it is more of an animal behavior rather than human. I cannot understand how can one do it. I don't understand how those criminals who do it are built psychologically.In the movie I liked how a True Muslim decides to become a witness and helps in police proceedings.The other thing I liked is that the movie is based on writings of a writer who is Muslim.",harsh reality but everyone should know it,movie is about blasts bombay now mumbai 1993 it is about how why they were carried out it also puts light criminals involved how justice was obtained i would like talk about other factors that came my mind while watching movie consider love people belonging islam it is great during month ramzan 18 1 13 26 1 14 it can be seen their fasting only because few them going along wrong path entire community should not be questioned when i turned atheism i felt most appropriate religion be that islam i mean somebody coming into dreams all that today i am again not atheist i feel what we are presented is stretched lot religious texts movie came exodus gods kings where events are drawn way how they could have been reality not stretched it is really commendable anurag kashyap brings this sort cinema see general public consider heinous crime rape i dont understand how it is possible have sex with someone when they are not psychologically involved thus i conclude it is more animal behavior rather than human i cannot understand how can one do it i dont understand how those criminals who do it are built psychologically movie i liked how true muslim decides become witness helps police proceedings other thing i liked is that movie is based writings writer who is muslim,0.47700617283950614,0.1300925925925926,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,A brutally honest look at the 1993 bomb blasts,"Anurag Kashyap is one of the best directors working in the Hindi film industry. I loved films like Ugly and Raman Raghav 2.0 and hearing this was one of his best, I had to check it out.Black Friday tells the story of the 1993 bomb blasts through the perspectives of the police, the perpetrators and everyone else involved.I find it fascinating how this film got pushed back so much and after seeing it, I can understand why. Based on the detailed book by Hussain Zaidi, Black Friday goes through everything leading up to the event and the aftermath and does it in a brutally honest manner. This film is risky and it's risky because it uses all the names of the people involved. Kashyap tried to make this a truly honest depiction of what was going on and that's what makes it really hardhitting. Without sugarcoating anything, Black Friday remains an interesting watch as we see the ins and outs of the bomb blasts. The film has many characters and trying to juggle everyone's story isn't an easy task but Kashyap does his best here and gives each important character ample screen time.Considering the film's budget limitations, this film still manages to capture the horrific nature of the blasts. Once it happens, seeing how it disturbs everyone's lives and the amount of dead bodies shown covered in blood is very intense and handled very realistically. I loved the use of red during the interrogation scenes as it increased the intense nature of the scene. The film isn't flawless. There are a couple of audio and editing issues. I think the 2 hour 40 minute runtime is a bit too long and occasionally loses steam during some parts but Black Friday is riveting most of the time.What really excels in this movie are the performances and I think everyone was terrific. Kay Kay Menon did a great job. I really felt the seriousness of his character during those interrogation scenes. Aditya Srivastav also did a fantastic job as one of the terrorists. The standout though was Pavan Malhotra as Tiger Memon. He owned every scene he was in. It was also really surprising to see a lot of well known people who were unknown at the time like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Gajraj Rao and Imtiaz Ali.Black Friday is a fantastic study on the 1993 bomb blasts and it's very impressive considering the low budget they had to work with.

,Bravo Anurag Kashyap for directing this uncompromisingly,"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.A message of Mahatma Gandhi, the line that begins the movie is all about the very essence of it. As per records, it's a 2004 film but it is sad to know that the release of this was delayed till Feb 9th 2007. Such is our censor board and government that was afraid of releasing a film that takes names of all involved in 1993 Bombay (now Mumbai) Blasts.Bravo Anurag Kashyap for directing this uncompromisingly with a vision that is so very rare in an industry like us. It's surely the most courageous attempt to make a film on an account of a real crime happened in 1993. More kudos to Hussain Zaidi, the original writer of the book who wrote actual facts and presenting reason for each doing of a character.The film is about investigation's done by Mumbai Cop Rakesh Maria (Kay Kay Menon) that unravels the Mumbai blasts plot setup by the dastardly un human Tiger Memon (Pawan Malhotra). Everything about the film is purely raw and makes you not audience but a participant of the activities happening on screen, they make you feel as a bystander on a blast as a silent observer of an investigation.Everything is right about this movie, the emotions portrayed by the accused Asgar Muqadam or Badshah Khan or those by inspector Dangle or MN Singh everyone brought life to the character they played.Anurag, the director captured every emotion be it trauma or a feeling of guilt or even of triumph everything was brought out well. The screenplay goes so very intelligently taking you through the whole incidents and the cinematography and art direction transform you to an era that you will believe is Bombay of 1993 where there were no mobile phones, no communication channels as email. And yet, so much was to be communicated in so little time from dubai to Pakistan to India's bombay.The best scene for me was Dawood's entry. It lasts hardly a minute but the impact it made was terrific.The music, oh my god he used it so very effectively be it a Bharam Bhaap Ke or a Bande ( a subtle message oriented philosophical song for end credits) or the whole background music, just beautiful may be the right word.The monochromatic red interrogation scenes make you feel eery and present an insight to the minds of all those doing it. All are great dialogues and apt ones but the most impact making one comes from Kay Kay when he describes that the culprits are actually victims.The editing had to be sharper coz at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the viewer may tend to slip off but this drama held me so very tight that I watched it for 3rd time without moving elsewhere. Be it a theatre or my computer, it just makes me sit and watch. This is how a gripping drama should be told.I dare say, in last decade, I have not seen a movie more raw, more realistic and more dramatic than this.When I first saw this film on first day in Fame Theatre in Pune, I remember that hardly 10 people would have seen this. Such is our appreciation for a movie that's easily one of the best made films. Having said that, so be it as long as there are movie goers who are passionate in watching films, this shall be remembered.I rate this 5/5 and give it best film made from 2000-2010. How many ever may come and go. This shall remain in memory for a long time, if seen once. This is the kind of film we should be nominating for every foreign award including Oscars. Sadly, our government has a different view on such films that are straight telling and bold.Thanks all for making it the film it stands today and I will revisit this again later.",bravo anurag kashyap directing this uncompromisingly,eye eye makes whole world blind message mahatma gandhi line that begins movie is all about very essence it as per records its 2004 film but it is sad know that release this was delayed till feb 9th 2007 such is our censor board government that was afraid releasing film that takes names all involved 1993 bombay now mumbai blasts bravo anurag kashyap directing this uncompromisingly with vision that is so very rare industry like us its surely most courageous attempt make film account real crime happened 1993 more kudos hussain zaidi original writer book who wrote actual facts presenting reason each doing character film is about investigations done by mumbai cop rakesh maria kay kay menon that unravels mumbai blasts plot setup by dastardly un human tiger memon pawan malhotra everything about film is purely raw makes you not audience but participant activities happening screen they make you feel as bystander blast as silent observer investigation everything is right about this movie emotions portrayed by accused asgar muqadam or badshah khan or those by inspector dangle or mn singh everyone brought life character they played anurag director captured every emotion be it trauma or feeling guilt or even triumph everything was brought out well screenplay goes so very intelligently taking you through whole incidents cinematography art direction transform you era that you will believe is bombay 1993 where there were no mobile phones no communication channels as email yet so much was be communicated so little time dubai pakistan indias bombay best scene me was dawoods entry it lasts hardly minute but impact it made was terrific music oh my god he used it so very effectively be it bharam bhaap ke or bande subtle message oriented philosophical song end credits or whole background music just beautiful may be right word monochromatic red interrogation scenes make you feel eery present insight minds all those doing it all are great dialogues apt ones but most impact making one comes kay kay when he describes that culprits are actually victims editing had be sharper coz at 2 hours 40 minutes viewer may tend slip off but this drama held me so very tight that i watched it 3rd time without moving elsewhere be it theatre or my computer it just makes me sit watch this is how gripping drama should be told i dare say last decade i have not seen movie more raw more realistic more dramatic than this when i first saw this film first day fame theatre pune i remember that hardly 10 people would have seen this such is our appreciation movie thats easily one best made films having said that so be it as long as there are movie goers who are passionate watching films this shall be remembered i rate this 5 5 give it best film made 2000 2010 how many ever may come go this shall remain memory long time if seen once this is kind film we should be nominating every foreign award including oscars sadly our government has different view such films that are straight telling bold thanks all making it film it stands today i will revisit this again later,0.4901169343477035,0.1752858551704705,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Black Friday - a tremendous film that goes places most Hindi films don't,"I had the opportunity to see the film at a screening in Berkeley as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival. Hopefully it will one day be released in India.1. The student has surpassed the master. Ram Gopal Varma may think he is pushing the envelope, but Anurag Kashyap has REALLY done that. Make no mistake about it: Kashyap was a big part of the genius behind Satya and it shows in the writing, pacing and even in some of the shots of Black Friday 2. The film is as politically incorrect as Mani Ratnam's Bombay was correct 3. When Satya released, Ali Peter John (of Screen magazine) had a review titled 'Listen, Mr. President Listen, every Indian.' He went on to say about Satya in his review 'That's why it must be seen by every Indian who still loves the truth, by every Indian who still swears he is an Indian.' These comments are equally valid with regards to Black Friday. There is no doubt that Kashyap is obsessed with the truth 4. So enough about other films, on to Black Friday. The film has a non-linear format not because it makes the story more interesting but because its the most impactful (and nearly only way) the story can be told. The film starts on March 9th, three days before the bomb blasts in Bombay and travels all the way forward to 1994 and all the way back to the riots in Bombay in December of 1992. The movie uses the chapters of the book its based on (by Hussain Zaidi) as benchmarks.5. If I had to classify the film I would say its a docu-drama. Its constructed as if it were part of the case for the prosecution (not my words, its in the prologue of the film). Kashyap uses real raw footage here and there.6. One of the great triumphs of this film is that it is strikingly objective. And I do not say this from my point of view. I cannot fathom how anyone cannot find this film objective from ANY point of view mainly because the film HAS no point of view (it wants the truth). Even if one disagrees with me on this, it is, at the very least, the least subjective film I've seen on such a big political/historical event in India.7. Kay Kay (as Inspector Rakesh Maria) is absolutely fantastic in this film though his screen time was limited (there are over 200 characters named in this film, go figure). The surprise packet here is Aditya Srivastava who absolutely nailed his character. Of course he has had minor roles in most of these films (he was Khandilkar in Satya) but I think he is an actor whose films I will definitely look out for.8. The film does a remarkable job of delving into the psyche of a terrorist AFTER an attack takes place and he is on the run (and I might add here that its the first film I've seen to do this) Of course this is probably well delineated in the book but Kashyap brings it to the silver screen with great emotion and extracts a (as I stated above) marvelous performance from Srivastava (it wouldn't have worked without him) in the process. The film goes into the psyche of the terrorist after the attacks to help the audience understand why he would (*SPOILER*, a very MINOR one though) squeal.9. The film has no songs but is still as long as your everyday Hindi film. The pacing is fantastic though.10. The cinematography is outstanding. There are a couple of extraordinary sequences; one of which is a rather comedic foot-chase scene 11. The background score is also outstanding and used wisely. Kashyap uses different styles/type of music throughout various chapters of the film. I don't know who did the score but in general the rule of thumb for fantastic background scores in recent (last 15 years or so) in Hindi cinema has been 1. its done by A.R. Rahman or 2. its in a Ram Gopal Varma film. This breaks that trend.12. The show I went to sold out as expected and at the end of it you could have heard the slightest bit of movement; there was pin-drop silence.13. The film's best scene (arguably) is an interrogation between Rakesh Maria (Kay Kay) and Badshah Khan (Aditya Srivastava). The dialogue here deals with communal/religious violence without being clichéd. The dialogue by Kay Kay is so great that one would think that it was spoken by some great historical figure when it was actually merely written by Kashyap! I thought of the scene in Lagaan when Bhuvan gives a discourse on caste-ism when I saw this scene in Black Friday. Of course, the scenes are different but their nature is the same in the sense that the dialogue is so far reaching and that it deals with complicated socio-political issues. The scene in Black Friday is infinitely more effective than its counterpart in Lagaan. They should just give Kay Kay awards for that scene alone (Srivastava was great as well).14. The film begins and ends with the quote by Gandhi 'An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind'",black friday tremendous film that goes places most hindi films dont,i had opportunity see film at screening berkeley as part san francisco international film festival hopefully it will one day be released india 1 student has surpassed master ram gopal varma may think he is pushing envelope but anurag kashyap has really done that make no mistake about it kashyap was big part genius behind satya it shows writing pacing even some shots black friday 2 film is as politically incorrect as mani ratnams bombay was correct 3 when satya released ali peter john screen magazine had review titled listen mr president listen every indian he went say about satya his review thats why it must be seen by every indian who still loves truth by every indian who still swears he is indian these comments are equally valid with regards black friday there is no doubt that kashyap is obsessed with truth 4 so enough about other films black friday film has non linear format not because it makes story more interesting but because its most impactful nearly only way story can be told film starts march 9th three days before bomb blasts bombay travels all way forward 1994 all way back riots bombay december 1992 movie uses chapters book its based by hussain zaidi as benchmarks 5 if i had classify film i would say its docu drama its constructed as if it were part case prosecution not my words its prologue film kashyap uses real raw footage here there 6 one great triumphs this film is that it is strikingly objective i do not say this my point view i cannot fathom how anyone cannot find this film objective any point view mainly because film has no point view it wants truth even if one disagrees with me this it is at very least least subjective film ive seen such big political historical event india 7 kay kay as inspector rakesh maria is absolutely fantastic this film though his screen time was limited there are over 200 characters named this film go figure surprise packet here is aditya srivastava who absolutely nailed his character course he has had minor roles most these films he was khandilkar satya but i think he is actor whose films i will definitely look out 8 film does remarkable job delving into psyche terrorist after attack takes place he is run i might add here that its first film ive seen do this course this is probably well delineated book but kashyap brings it silver screen with great emotion extracts as i stated above marvelous performance srivastava it wouldnt have worked without him process film goes into psyche terrorist after attacks help audience understand why he would spoiler very minor one though squeal 9 film has no songs but is still as long as your everyday hindi film pacing is fantastic though 10 cinematography is outstanding there are couple extraordinary sequences one which is rather comedic foot chase scene 11 background score is also outstanding used wisely kashyap uses different styles type music throughout various chapters film i dont know who did score but general rule thumb fantastic background scores recent last 15 years or so hindi cinema has been 1 its done by r rahman or 2 its ram gopal varma film this breaks that trend 12 show i went sold out as expected at end it you could have heard slightest bit movement there was pin drop silence 13 films best scene arguably is interrogation between rakesh maria kay kay badshah khan aditya srivastava dialogue here deals with communal religious violence without being clich d dialogue by kay kay is so great that one would think that it was spoken by some great historical figure when it was actually merely written by kashyap i thought scene lagaan when bhuvan gives discourse caste ism when i saw this scene black friday course scenes are different but their nature is same sense that dialogue is so far reaching that it deals with complicated socio political issues scene black friday is infinitely more effective than its counterpart lagaan they should just give kay kay awards that scene alone srivastava was great as well 14 film begins ends with quote by gandhi eye eye only makes whole world blind,0.49500214071642623,0.1322824794253366,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,About Black Friday,"I just watched this movie and I think that this is a must watch for all connoisseurs of Gangland cinema. The movie recounts the story of a forgettable Friday in the life of movie. It also shows the meticulous planning of the blasts by mastermind Tiger Menon. What I especially like is the first face-off between KK Menon playing the police officer investigating the case and Badshah Khan played by Aditya Srivastava. Badshah Khan mentions that Allah or Khuda is on their side. At this, KK says that if Allah was at your side, you would not have left that Maruti Van near Siemens. And then the dialog that follows is captivating. Great job Anurag Kashyap - I am going to recommend this movie to everyone I know and tell them that if they want a taste of reality and are sick of Karan Johar and Salaam-E-Ishq kind of movies, this is the real deal.
