9,One the best Political thriller produced by Bollywood,"Direction: Vivek Agnihotri gave honest try for mystical death of Lal Bahudur Shastri ji and he succeeded in his objective. This poltical thriller is totally nail biting one as it will hook up you till the climax. Performance: We must say thanks to casting director as he did choose any A-star. Shweta Basu Prasad take the lead in the role of Raagini Phule as small age journalist. Mithun da proved his acting once again with political role. Naseer was also great in touch with role of home minister. Mandira added more power as NGO owner and Pallavi as Historian. Pankaj Tripathi once again impressed his audience with monologue on Secularism. Rajesh Sharma and Vinay Pathak did brilliant job in small role. Script: Vivek has done really work hard to make this script so meaningful and gave some message without any political alignment. It has many other big cover up e.g. KGB agents presence in Pan India, Death of Deendayal ji and Shyma Prasad along with Plane crash of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Dialogue: Great dialogue with punches make any script more powerful and robust. There was some section with brilliant dialogues e.g. India on sale and Secularism issue. Music: This section was not up the mark as it can be better than this. Rohit Sharma must added some meaningful track with perfect timing. Box-office: On day 1, it has collected .4o Crores but collection will be increase on Sat and Sun as good words of mouth for this movie.

8,I thoroughly felt entertained by it,"Great film, probably the most I've enjoyed a Bollywood film so far.'The Tashkent Files' isn't a typical Hindi film, at least compared to the ones I've watched thus far. It takes its time with the story and properly sifts through it, without any songs shoehorned in. I thoroughly felt entertained by it, despite a potentially damaging 144 minute run time.There are some very good performances from the cast. Shweta Basu Prasad is no doubt the star, she puts a lot of emotion into the role of Raagini. Mithun Chakraborty is extremely likeable as Shyam, he keeps the film moving when the focus comes away from Prasad. Naseeruddin Shah is the most noteworthy of the rest, who are all pleasant to watch.I had no knowledge of Lal Bahadur Shastri before this, so it was very interesting to learn bits and pieces about this period of India's history - even if it features disputed elements and the usual creative license that films use. I think they tell it very well, with/without the aforementioned.I watched this on the UK's Zee Cinema channel, who broadcasted a version with a crap tonne of censorship over names, countries, organisations etc. It actually turned into an amusing little game to try and guess what was behind the blur!In seriousness though, this is most definitely worth a watch.",i thoroughly felt entertained by it,great film probably most ive enjoyed bollywood film so far tashkent files isnt typical hindi film at least compared ones ive watched thus far it takes its time with story properly sifts through it without any songs shoehorned i thoroughly felt entertained by it despite potentially damaging 144 minute run time there are some very good performances cast shweta basu prasad is no doubt star she puts lot emotion into role raagini mithun chakraborty is extremely likeable as shyam he keeps film moving when focus comes away prasad naseeruddin shah is most noteworthy rest who are all pleasant watch i had no knowledge lal bahadur shastri before this so it was very interesting learn bits pieces about this period indias history even if it features disputed elements usual creative license that films use i think they tell it very well with without aforementioned i watched this uks zee cinema channel who broadcasted version with crap tonne censorship over names countries organisations etc it actually turned into amusing little game try guess what was behind blur seriousness though this is most definitely worth watch,0.596025641025641,0.16400641025641027,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
8,The Tashkent Files is the hard-hitting truth which is painful but is better than make-believe.,"Last year I was watching a web-series, Bose, which tells the truth behind the disappearance of freedom fighter Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. The web-series was remarkable telling the events which led to his disappearance and conspiracies surrounding his death. One of the activities of Netaji which led to more suspicion was his appearance in The Tashkent peace treaty agreement between India and Pakistan in 1966 and his rendezvous with Lal Bahadur Shastri after the farewell party about some information which would put the insiders in trouble. Obviously, Lal Bahadur Shastri died just few hours after the meeting and only his dead body, wrapped in Indian flag arrived. This led to my interest in the last week's release, The Tashkent Files.The Tashkent Files is an attempt to know the truth behind the mysterious death of Lal Bahadur Shastri, 2nd Prime Minister of India, which has led to many conspiracies.Directed by Vivek Agnihotri (Hate Story), The Tashkent Files will remind you of a classic movie, Ek Ruka Hua Faisal, where panel of experts are called in to discuss a murder trial. Similarly, a journalist who had to submit a scoop to her chief editor at a leading media channel, gets involved in knowing the truth behind death of the 2nd Prime Minister of India and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress political party, Lal Bahadur Shastri. The thriller successfully puts forward few questions :-1. How come the color of dead body of Lal Bahadur Shastri changed when it was received in India and why were there so many cuts on the body if he died of a natural death ?2. Why was there no post-mortem performed after his death ?3. Why did Indian Government refused to reveal any documents relating to his death ?4. There were two people beside Lal Bahadur Shastri - his servant Ram Nath and Dr. Chugh who were the only witness to the case and co-incidentally got hit by a moving vehicle.The movie also raises the point on the how the Russian spy agency, KJB, sent suitcases of money, amounting to 10.6 million. Unfortunately, the truth is harsh and is never told but as a citizen of India, everyone has right to information and the film ask very gently - Why there should be a change in the Indian History books, we have all studied in school. I think the movie should be watched by people of India and decide what is the best for our country rather than blindly following someone.Coming to the technical aspect, The Tashkent Files has good background score and tight screenplay, though it misses few marks in the second half. Art direction is decent and so is the cinematography. Writing by Vivek Agnihotri is strong along with his direction. Performances by the star cast is good, especially Shweta Prasad.Overall, The Tashkent Files is the hard-hitting truth that is painful but is better than make-believe. Excellent 4/5",tashkent files is hard hitting truth which is painful but is better than make believe,last year i was watching web series bose which tells truth behind disappearance freedom fighter netaji subhash chandra bose web series was remarkable telling events which led his disappearance conspiracies surrounding his death one activities netaji which led more suspicion was his appearance tashkent peace treaty agreement between india pakistan 1966 his rendezvous with lal bahadur shastri after farewell party about some information which would put insiders trouble obviously lal bahadur shastri died just few hours after meeting only his dead body wrapped indian flag arrived this led my interest last weeks release tashkent files tashkent files is attempt know truth behind mysterious death lal bahadur shastri 2nd prime minister india which has led many conspiracies directed by vivek agnihotri hate story tashkent files will remind you classic movie ek ruka hua faisal where panel experts are called discuss murder trial similarly journalist who had submit scoop her chief editor at leading media channel gets involved knowing truth behind death 2nd prime minister india senior leader indian national congress political party lal bahadur shastri thriller successfully puts forward few questions 1 how come color dead body lal bahadur shastri changed when it was received india why were there so many cuts body if he died natural death 2 why was there no post mortem performed after his death 3 why did indian government refused reveal any documents relating his death 4 there were two people beside lal bahadur shastri his servant ram nath dr chugh who were only witness case co incidentally got hit by moving vehicle movie also raises point how russian spy agency kjb sent suitcases money amounting 10 6 million unfortunately truth is harsh is never told but as citizen india everyone has right information film ask very gently why there should be change indian history books we have all studied school i think movie should be watched by people india decide what is best our country rather than blindly following someone coming technical aspect tashkent files has good background score tight screenplay though it misses few marks second half art direction is decent so is cinematography writing by vivek agnihotri is strong along with his direction performances by star cast is good especially shweta prasad overall tashkent files is hard hitting truth that is painful but is better than make believe excellent 4 5,0.4876750700280114,0.05066293183940242,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10,"""Was Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri's Death Natural ?""","Based on one of the most controversial chapters of India's history, The Tashkent Files tries to recreate a hard-hitting and volatile political drama. The film is based in modern times, as a journalist takes a deep dive into investigating Lal Bahadur Shastri's death from 1966. While the pursuit of truth after half-a-century may seem jaded, the young journalist, played by Shweta Basu Prasad, chases the scoop because she's overly ambitious and in the world of social media, any sensationalist topic, will do. So she and a whole host of politicians, social workers and civil servants, join a committee that has the task of uncovering and reinvestigating the truth.A young and ambitious journalist Ragini Phule (Shweta Basu Prasad) receives an anonymous tip about a scoop behind India's ex-Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri's mysterious death in Tashkent. She publishes a story in the newspaper, which leads to an official committee being set up by the government to investigate the 53-year-old case.Director and writer Vivek Agnihotri explores a lot of political stories, facts and rumours through the story. As the young journo comes face to face with the history of Shastri's death, she also realises that the world of politics and espionage can be overwhelming for the common man. That the story is able to put across such a relevant point is commendable, but the execution of such ideas is far from ideal. The direction and narrative of the film is consistent. Also the music, both the background score and the songs used in montages, are loud and compliment the complex nature of the story at all.One of the film's strengths is the ensemble cast featuring Naseeruddin Shah, Mithun Chakraborty, Pallavi Joshi, Pankaj Tripathi, Mandira Bedi and more. Even the film's lead, Shweta Basu Prasad, gives an honest performance.The Tashkent Files makes some shocking claims about India's political history, dynasty politics and the citizen's right to know the truth. All its sensational content is relevant and important social issues are highlighted, too.",was shri lal bahadur shastris death natural,based one most controversial chapters indias history tashkent files tries recreate hard hitting volatile political drama film is based modern times as journalist takes deep dive into investigating lal bahadur shastris death 1966 while pursuit truth after half century may seem jaded young journalist played by shweta basu prasad chases scoop because shes overly ambitious world social media any sensationalist topic will do so she whole host politicians social workers civil servants join committee that has task uncovering reinvestigating truth young ambitious journalist ragini phule shweta basu prasad receives anonymous tip about scoop behind indias ex prime minister lal bahadur shastris mysterious death tashkent she publishes story newspaper which leads official committee being set up by government investigate 53 year old case director writer vivek agnihotri explores lot political stories facts rumours through story as young journo comes face face with history shastris death she also realises that world politics espionage can be overwhelming common man that story is able put across such relevant point is commendable but execution such ideas is far ideal direction narrative film is consistent also music both background score songs used montages are loud compliment complex nature story at all one films strengths is ensemble cast featuring naseeruddin shah mithun chakraborty pallavi joshi pankaj tripathi mandira bedi more even films lead shweta basu prasad gives honest performance tashkent files makes some shocking claims about indias political history dynasty politics citizens right know truth all its sensational content is relevant important social issues are highlighted too,0.5398954703832752,0.13644018583042974,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.54}"

7,A MUCH NEEDED INTELLECTUAL MUST WATCH FILM IN BOLLYWOOD !,"THE TASHKENT FILES REVIEW :- A MUCH NEEDED INTELLECTUAL MUST WATCH FILM IN BOLLYWOOD !How many of us knows that 2nd October is the Birth Anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shashtri as well? We call India as Country of Gandhiji and Nehruji, why not Shashtriji's? How strong was India's Position on Global Map when Lal Bahadur Shashtri was Prime Minister of India and how all of sudden India lost that strong position just after his mysterious death? These all are unsolved puzzles and we have had enough arguments and political propagandas over this, but Tashkent Files is just not about this, it is something more than that. It is about Secularism, socialism, terrorism, politics, our rights and bla bla but when all of these comes with a Great Cinematic Experience then believe me you just can't afford to miss this gem.The Tashkent Files deals with multiple issues at the same time keeping Shashtriji's death mystery at the center, rest phenomena of beneficial nature of people, types of terrorism, racism and the Fake Truth which has been accepted by our society etc. is created with Perfect mindset by the Writer and the Director Vivek Agnihotri. He finally comes out of his Adult Thrillers zome and delivers a Must See Experience. The entire cast does the justice to thier roles with thier own perfection. While Shweta Prasad showcases Best act of her career, Mithun Chakraborty, Mandira bedi and Pallavi Joshi stands out. Music was needless but there is one theme song ""Sab Chalta Hai"" which fails to impress, although Lyrics hits the Sharp aim on the subject. Dialogues are Knocky and you will utter 'Wow' for them at some occassions.At one moment, The Tashkent Files feels like Bollywood version of Hollywood Cult Classic '12 Angry Men' due to those Arguments and conference scenes but the motive was different here. Apart from unrevealed Facts on Shashtri, it also focuses on few political agendas and propagandas in thrilling mode. Overall, The Tashkent Files is much needed Intellectual Must Watch Film for Bollywood in this year and is certainly the Most Intelligent+Thinkable product of the year so far. One must have some brilliant knowledge of History to judge this film, and that's the reason why I am not sure whether to call it a Classic or not, hence rating is 7/10*",much needed intellectual must watch film bollywood,tashkent files review much needed intellectual must watch film bollywood how many us knows that 2nd october is birth anniversary lal bahadur shashtri as well we call india as country gandhiji nehruji why not shashtrijis how strong was indias position global map when lal bahadur shashtri was prime minister india how all sudden india lost that strong position just after his mysterious death these all are unsolved puzzles we have had enough arguments political propagandas over this but tashkent files is just not about this it is something more than that it is about secularism socialism terrorism politics our rights bla bla but when all these comes with great cinematic experience then believe me you just cant afford miss this gem tashkent files deals with multiple issues at same time keeping shashtrijis death mystery at center rest phenomena beneficial nature people types terrorism racism fake truth which has been accepted by our society etc is created with perfect mindset by writer director vivek agnihotri he finally comes out his adult thrillers zome delivers must see experience entire cast does justice thier roles with thier own perfection while shweta prasad showcases best act her career mithun chakraborty mandira bedi pallavi joshi stands out music was needless but there is one theme song sab chalta hai which fails impress although lyrics hits sharp aim subject dialogues are knocky you will utter wow them at some occassions at one moment tashkent files feels like bollywood version hollywood cult classic 12 angry men due those arguments conference scenes but motive was different here apart unrevealed facts shashtri it also focuses few political agendas propagandas thrilling mode overall tashkent files is much needed intellectual must watch film bollywood this year is certainly most intelligent thinkable product year so far one must have some brilliant knowledge history judge this film thats reason why i am not sure whether call it classic or not hence rating is 7 10,0.5197337962962965,0.14340277777777774,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.44}"

8,Every Indian must watch this,"People complaining that this is a right wing propaganda. Let me tell you something. This film hasn't mentioned ring wing Or anything like that at all. Moreover, it makes us feel the world from both perspectives. Yes, you heard right, it also mocks imperialism and capitalism. So, don't listen to hypocrites, no matter which side you are, if you're an Indian, you must watch this.Now talking bout the film, it's a courtroom drama where a committee discuss about the mysterious death of Shri Lal Bahadur Shahstri. Man, this film literally exposed the dirty politics of our country and how an honest leader like Shashtriji got murdered. Not only that, it provides certain evidences to prove that. It cites different interviews, articles, documents and most importantly, The Mitrokhin Archives, which i feel, every indian should read. Overall it's a good movie but there are two cons:- 1) It loses it's pace before interval 2) The music is cringe. Especially, that 'sab chalta hai' song, ehhh.

9,Must watch,"Watch it for these reasons- 1. It's an intelligent movie . You don't feel it's a waste of time like you do for most Bollywood movies. 2. You start questioning your entire schooling system - specially history lessons. 3. Shastriji was a great man . But now you start feeling that his greatness was not highlighted and his memory was deliberately removed from the Indians minds. 4. If the proofs given in the movie are valid, then you would now know that you are actually not living in a democracy. 5. Watch it for the direction, acting and focus the movie keeps on the subject. Hats off !! 6. Most important reason - watch it because the newspapers and critics have given the movie a poor rating. So what is said in the movie is actually true !!Let's do our bit and teach our children that 2nd Oct is also the birth anniversary of Shastriji and insist on the schools highlighting it too.",must watch,watch it these reasons 1 its intelligent movie you dont feel its waste time like you do most bollywood movies 2 you start questioning your entire schooling system specially history lessons 3 shastriji was great man but now you start feeling that his greatness was not highlighted his memory was deliberately removed indians minds 4 if proofs given movie are valid then you would now know that you are actually not living democracy 5 watch it direction acting focus movie keeps subject hats off 6 most important reason watch it because newspapers critics have given movie poor rating so what is said movie is actually true lets do our bit teach our children that 2nd oct is also birth anniversary shastriji insist schools highlighting it too,0.46641156462585037,0.2100340136054422,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"
