10.0,"Brutally violent, emotional, and character-driven, ""Logan"" is the Wolverine film fans have been waiting for","""Logan"" is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman for one final go around as Wolverine. With an R Rating secured, something the previous two Wolverine films should have had, ""Logan"" was bound to be fantastic. It wasn't fantastic. It was phenomenal.If you are going into ""Logan"" expecting every scene to just be Wolverine tearing people to shreds you'll be thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. ""Logan"" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men film to date. We get enough of Wolverine's backstory within the first few minutes to really become attached to him (if we already weren't). We learn more about Professor X and what he has been doing, and then there's this little girl, who probably should be annoying, but luckily isn't and that was a sigh of relief. This girl, Laura, is the star of the show. It is really ""her"" movie. All of the sequences with Laura were riveting. There was that sense of mystery to her character that you wouldn't really expect from a film like this. You don't ever really know what her next move is going to be. Her motivation to find a safe haven is so well felt in this film that it just brings you a sigh of relief that there is still a sense of good out there in the world of this film where everything seems dark, bleak, and hopeless. Hugh Jackman's performance. Yeah the dude gave it his all. This is by far Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. The conviction from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with the filmmakers on set.This film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. It is brutally violent, by far the most violent X-Men film w have gotten. Wolverine hacks, claws, and slashes his way through skirmishes with blood, guts, and gore flying. If this is what you had always wanted from a Wolverine movie and haven't gotten it up to this point, well this movie gives you all of that. From a violence standpoint, the violence is there when the film calls for it. It is not violent for the sake of being violent. This is a film that puts its characters and story first before anything else, with violence being a secondary element to help propel the story along and to create tension. It is in the scenes where it should be. If this were just an all-out 2 hour and 20 minute ""hack-and-slash"" fest this film would have no depth to it. It would look cool, but giving Hugh Jackman the proper sendoff was what was more important in a film like this.This film at times gets downright emotional. The final scene of the film makes you wanna cry. You care about these characters, you are invested in them. You don't want to see them put in harm's way. Even in the scenes where the film may feel a bit slow, the final act of the film is the payoff. This is where everything really meshes together with a force, creating a pulse-pounding, edge of your seat final sendoff for Hugh Jackman as he retires from the role. This is by far the best Wolverine movie and possibly the best X-Men movie to date. I haven't decided yet. It's up there, and it deserves to be. Everything payed off in this film. It is emotional. It is character driven. It has heart. It is emotional. This is everything anyone could have wanted in a Wolverine film.From me ""Logan"" gets a perfect 10/10.",brutally violent emotional character driven logan is wolverine film fans have been waiting,logan is directed by james mangold stars hugh jackman one final go around as wolverine with r rating secured something previous two wolverine films should have had logan was bound be fantastic it wasnt fantastic it was phenomenal if you are going into logan expecting every scene just be wolverine tearing people shreds youll be thoroughly disappointed this is definitely not action film there are action sequences film but they are not main focus movie like previous 2 wolverine movies tried make them be logan is grounded film film that really takes its time tell its story develop its characters its character driven film it probably has most characterization x men film date we get enough wolverines backstory within first few minutes really become attached him if we already werent we learn more about professor x what he has been doing then theres this little girl who probably should be annoying but luckily isnt that was sigh relief this girl laura is star show it is really her movie all sequences with laura were riveting there was that sense mystery her character that you wouldnt really expect film like this you dont ever really know what her next move is going be her motivation find safe haven is so well felt this film that it just brings you sigh relief that there is still sense good out there world this film where everything seems dark bleak hopeless hugh jackmans performance yeah dude gave it his all this is by far hugh jackmans best performance as wolverine weve never seen wolverine this vulnerable hes old hes broken down hes beaten he cant heal like he used conviction hugh jackman this movie was just spot really captured ways wolverine felt at certain moments it added layers this film when wolverine gets into fight hugh jackman is so good these scenes its like he got into fight with filmmakers set this film does not hold back violence standpoint get go you know what type movie you are it is brutally violent by far most violent x men film w have gotten wolverine hacks claws slashes his way through skirmishes with blood guts gore flying if this is what you had always wanted wolverine movie havent gotten it up this point well this movie gives you all that violence standpoint violence is there when film calls it it is not violent sake being violent this is film that puts its characters story first before anything else with violence being secondary element help propel story along create tension it is scenes where it should be if this were just all out 2 hour 20 minute hack slash fest this film would have no depth it it would look cool but giving hugh jackman proper sendoff was what was more important film like this this film at times gets downright emotional final scene film makes you wanna cry you care about these characters you are invested them you dont want see them put harms way even scenes where film may feel bit slow final act film is payoff this is where everything really meshes together with force creating pulse pounding edge your seat final sendoff hugh jackman as he retires role this is by far best wolverine movie possibly best x men movie date i havent decided yet its up there it deserves be everything payed off this film it is emotional it is character driven it has heart it is emotional this is everything anyone could have wanted wolverine film me logan gets perfect 10 10,0.551184371184371,0.0828907203907204,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,"If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.","The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.",if there was ever comic book movie deemed worthy perfect logan is it,word perfect is very objective especially when it comes film while logan may not be perfect film it is most certainly perfect comic book film it is masterpiece most epic proportions leaves us with brilliant swan song producer star hugh jackman his final outing as wolverine film directed brilliantly by james mangold is two plus hour comic book fans wet dream as we see version wolverine every fan has wanted see nearly two decades while many will be very sad see jackman step down role he couldnt have picked better or more satisfying film end his cinematic legacy with film takes place 2029 shows world shambles mutants are nearly extinct water is scarce world is just overall wasteland this is where we find logan he is limo driving cantankerous caretaker even more cantankerous professor x who is now suffering dementia seizures he is borderline alcoholic suffering mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities due this he lives this quiet life until he meets young girl who he feels he must protect without giving too much away there is much more here than i can go into but i will say if you are fan wolverine comics this film will bring tear your eye this is probably most faithful adaptation comic book character ever marvel dc combined way story goes way logan behaves selflessness rage this is all around realized version this character while it may have taken little longer than it should have this film was worth wait james mangold does fantastic job at creating world logan knows now this is more film like mangolds 3 10 yuma it is bleak violent absolutely heartbreaking this is far pg 13 character were used this is foul mouthed miserable very very bloody rendition source material this is film very much like guantlet or badlands crime thriller road drama it very much embodies look feel film mid 70s it plays this very well performances this film are amazing hugh jackmans performance here is best as character may be one best his career he is miserable broken this film see him like this as character it is bittersweet especially because jackman has been so attached this role if he hurts we hurt if hes mad were mad it is true testament jackman as actor make his audience feel this connected someone who is by traditional standards completely unrelateable boyd holbrook brings sinister performance this continues build very impressive resume holbrook is someone who youll love hate real standout performance here is dafne keen who plays laura without giving away any spoilers she is badass this film even gives logan run his money brutality overall logan is perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning mangold jackman create special film with this that should be talked about years come believe hype logan is seriously amazing comic book film that just may be best ever made embodies definition perfect adaptation,0.6262162440733867,0.18691455370026788,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"A gritty, more adult Wolverine film","It is 2029 and Logan is getting old and tired. Most of the mutants are long gone although Professor Charles Xavier is still alive; he too is old though and as his mind goes so does the control of his powers. Logan is working as a limo drive in the area near the Mexican border and is approached by a woman asking him to drive her and a young girl, Laura, to North Dakota. It turns out Laura is a mutant with similar powers to Logan; unlike him though she isn't a natural mutation but one of a group of new mutants created in a lab in Mexico City as part of an experiment to create super-soldiers. When the experiment was judged to have failed the children were due to be killed so their carers are trying to get them to safety. Logan is initially unwilling to get involved but eventually ends up heading north with Laura and Xavier. They are pursued by those determined to retrieve Laura; everybody who gets in their way is expendable.Those expecting another 'X-Men' film will certainly get a bit of a shock; this is not an exciting superhero movie suitable for all but young children. Instead it is almost consistently downbeat with some fairly brutal violence as Logan and Laura remove limbs and puncture skulls with their adamantium claws. There are some genuine surprises as bad things happen to characters one would expect to be safe. Hugh Jackman is great in the lead role, showing a different side to Logan; he is no longer young and angry, instead he is old and world-weary. Young Dafne Keen impresses as Laura; an almost feral girl who makes Hit Girl from 'Kick-Ass' look gentle! There are nods to other films; most notably 'Shane', which Laura watches with Xavier and their search for the possibly mythical Eden in North Dakota reminded me of a different Logan's search for Sanctuary in 'Logan's Run'. I'd certainly recommend this to older X-Men fans but would caution against showing it to younger fans as it is very violent and has some pretty depressing moments.",gritty more adult wolverine film,it is 2029 logan is getting old tired most mutants are long gone although professor charles xavier is still alive he too is old though as his mind goes so does control his powers logan is working as limo drive area near mexican border is approached by woman asking him drive her young girl laura north dakota it turns out laura is mutant with similar powers logan unlike him though she isnt natural mutation but one group new mutants created lab mexico city as part experiment create super soldiers when experiment was judged have failed children were due be killed so their carers are trying get them safety logan is initially unwilling get involved but eventually ends up heading north with laura xavier they are pursued by those determined retrieve laura everybody who gets their way is expendable those expecting another x men film will certainly get bit shock this is not exciting superhero movie suitable all but young children instead it is almost consistently downbeat with some fairly brutal violence as logan laura remove limbs puncture skulls with their adamantium claws there are some genuine surprises as bad things happen characters one would expect be safe hugh jackman is great lead role showing different side logan he is no longer young angry instead he is old world weary young dafne keen impresses as laura almost feral girl who makes hit girl kick ass look gentle there are nods other films most notably shane which laura watches with xavier their search possibly mythical eden north dakota reminded me different logans search sanctuary logans run id certainly recommend this older x men fans but would caution against showing it younger fans as it is very violent has some pretty depressing moments,0.5045546651929631,0.040211384360320526,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,Logan is everything you wanted it to be and more,"Logan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.Logan presents us with Logan (Wolverine), Professor X and Laura (X-23) and by definition its an escort mission involving X-23 but shes more capable than Logan and Professor X thinks and shes able to fend for herself.

9.0,"A fine, fitting farewell to an iconic character, LOGAN is one of the best superhero movies ever made.","Let's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core. Set in a grim near-future where very few mutants remain alive, we meet an unthinkable incarnation of our favourite enclawed superhero: one who's decidedly past his prime. This is not the near-immortal Wolverine we remember, but Logan (Jackman): a broken, far older man who feels the weight of every wound inflicted upon him. His once- formidable body – tattooed with scars that aren't healing as fast or as well as they used to – seems to be failing. It's only his determination to keep the ailing, ageing Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) safe and alive that never falters. The film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story.In effect, Mangold has placed an intimate family drama squarely at the heart of this ostensible blockbuster film – strip the characters of their superpowers and LOGAN would still pulse with plenty of heartbreak and humanity. Logan keeps dragging himself through the world when one suspects all he wants to do is die. Xavier grapples with his own frailty as his once-sharp mind deteriorates and betrays him, again and again. Laura is a tough, tender mess of contradictions: a victim of horrific abuse but also a warrior in the making. Watching them interact – fighting, screaming, arguing, glaring and, once in a while, forgiving – will elicit laughter and tears (lots of tears), in a way that no other superhero film to date has quire managed.That doesn't mean, however, that LOGAN is an entirely joyless, sombre affair. Far from it. It proves, quite conclusively, that films in this genre can plumb the darkest of psychological depths while finding welcome ways to leaven the misery. (Note: this is something Zack Snyder would do well to learn as he continues to expand DC's largely mirthless cinematic universe.) Mangold threads moments of genuine humour into the proceedings – from casual shoplifting and runaway horses, to an ornery old man who refuses to take his pills. The fast and furious action beats in LOGAN are also quite delightful to witness. The violence that's on full, bloody display is dark and horrible, but somehow fitting for this film in which there really are consequences for battles fought and lost. It's only when you see Logan's claws plunging into flesh, shearing cleanly through meat and bone, that you realise just how neutered and family-friendly his earlier outings were. There's a slow-motion sequence halfway through the film, as Logan struggles to get to an embattled Xavier, that's gritty and beautiful to watch – as thrilling as that scene-stealing Quicksilver moment in X-Men: Days Of Future Past. And it goes without saying that watching Laura gracefully spin and slice her way through oncoming attackers manages to be terribly wrong and wonderfully right at the same time. To be quite frank, none of this would work without the incredible cast, all of them doing award-worthy work that will, sadly, be overlooked because their characters have such silly things as 'powers'. It's truly unsettling to watch Stewart dig beneath his natural gravitas to find the shaken core of a Professor X who's semi-consciously losing grip of his mind – the best and most dangerous mind in the universe. Keen is a revelation. Grabbing this breakout role by the throat and making it very much her own, she somehow manages to convey Laura's childish fragility and overpowering strength, often in the same breath. And, finally, there's Jackman. He's been training for and playing the role that catapulted him to global stardom for 17 years now, and he brings everything he has to this final outing as Logan. He nails Logan's physical tics, of course: from his grizzled and aged demeanour, to his rattling cough and copious drinking. But Jackman also takes delight in unearthing the dark sadness at the heart of this once invincible, now vulnerable man. There is a hope and purity in Logan that doesn't always show through his wisecracks, but it shines brightly and unexpectedly here – often in the film's saddest moments. There are a handful of things about the film don't work quite so well. The main antagonists, played by Richard E. Grant and Boyd Holbrook, are largely forgettable – there's not much that defines them outside their nefarious goals. As many viewers may be turned off by Logan's relentless misery and eye-popping violence as those who welcome it.But this doesn't detract from the fact that LOGAN is a remarkable achievement. It manages to be several things at once: a bruising action film, a tender family drama and an intimate character study, liberally shaken through with comic-book sensibilities and a Western or two. If Jackman really is hanging up his claws for good, there could be no better way to bid farewell to one of Marvel's most enduring and appealing characters.",fine fitting farewell iconic character

9.0,Say goodbye to Hugh Jackman...,"When Logan heard that his comic book would work in a similar way, my expectation was a little more. Later Logan's first trailer ended me. The tone of the trailers, the selected music, the intensity of the emotion was superb. I did not get my eye from X-23 in action scenes. Very good performance. Sir Patrick Stewart, like Hugh Jackman, is the last time to portray the role of the X-Men in the universe. And gave a very good feeling and left the film with more drama.Logan, beyond his superhero films, a fickle old and sick man. He is constantly showing the struggle with himself. Unlike other films, violence and action are not adorned with visual effects, they are given in a very hard and realistic way. These old mutants are trying to save the children to make the world a better place.It's an action that will be an Oscar nominee from Hugh Jackman.

8.0,Logan the Personal,"Let me start by saying that ""Logan"" is my first favorite movie from 2017. And let me continue by saying that you should not read this review if you have not seen the film yet as it will be full of spoilers to an extent where the normal message up there is not enough and I would like to put special emphasis on this. Now lets go: James Mangold returns from the 2013 film ""Wolverine"" here and I think he did a really good job as this film never drags despite a runtime of over 2 hours and 15 minutes. It's probably still not my favorite from him (""Walk the Line""), but this should not take away anything from his effort. You will not really see too many familiar faces in this one except Jackman and Stewart. As for Stewart, there is one quote from him about mortality and this is a theme that fits the entire movie. Everybody keeps dying here, the good guys, the bad guys and the longer it goes the more you wonder if Logan will get out of it alive. The wolf has gone gray and he only has two friends left with whom he is arguing all the time. For example what I just said also applies to an innocent family of Black people and the dad is a perfect example of how hate towards the mutants is fueled, even if you cannot blame Jackman's character really for anything that happened to this family. It's all humans causing it with their decisions.This film has many parallels to other quality films like Léon The Professional (check my review title), Mad Max, Children of Men and this reminded me repeatedly of the child soldiers from the James Cameron television show ""Dark Angel"", a personal favorite. The ""Logan"" title cannot be coincidence right? Holbrook also reminded me a bit of Ames White with the Nazi-resembling race references, but if you know DA, you will see the similarities in general. Anyway, for fans of this series, it's probably the closest we're ever getting of a Dark Angel film with Cameron focusing on all these Avatar sequels right now. Now back to ""Logan"": If there is anything negative to say about this film, then maybe that the child soldier reference was not always working, but still this one also provided really touching scenes at the very end of the film and honestly the X grave was a stroke of genius and a perfect final shot. Also kinda fitting and cool that he can only be killed by his alternate self. It was a sad ending, but also an uplifting one with the next generation of mutants (and with the girl Wolverine left us) going out into the world. Johnny Cash song during the credits doesn't hurt either. Oh yeah and the pain from Stewart's character's brain was done so well you could feel it even in the theater. It is certainly a pretty depressing movie, but this also makes it really authentic I believe. There are very rare moments of situational comedy in there, like the fat kid being too fat to run and gets caught, but it's nowhere near the surface. This film delivers in 10 other areas much more than in comedy.I think I have only seen the very first X-Men film apart from this one here, so even as somebody who is not a fan of the series (but likes superhero movies), it's easy to appreciate this one. Huge fans will probably love it. I think it is impressive how this series is still going so strong after 20 years almost and it was the perfect decision back then to cast the entirely unknown Hugh Jackman for the part as he is a vital ingredient why this film was such a triumph, with critics as well as audiences. I like him a lot and I am certainly biased, but it's hard to disagree with his craft after seeing this movie. Will there be another? Unlikely. I just hope that the fate of Wolverine's character does not go in hand with the fate of Jackman's as you keep reading so frequently about his fight with skin cancer. ""Logan"" also includes a great deal of action which was among the more forgettable parts for me, but there's enough people who like it, so it's all good. And after all with this runtime, people like me also get a great deal of character development and drama besides the special effects. So there are more reasons to see this film than I could actually mention here. You totally do not want to miss out.

10.0,The Last Cut Is The Deepest!,"SPOILER: Did we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.James Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.Logan's Run!Ah yes, well being ""adult"" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very ""human"" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.Tech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is ""A"" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.One of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10",last cut is deepest,spoiler did we need another x men movie fact did we need another wolverine movie well result is there all see with logan not only showing itself be undoubtedly best wolverine venture by far but arguably best x men picture as well if as expected surely god its hoped so this is last we see grumpy metal clawed superhero then what fitting triumphant bow out it is james mangold director has managed create adult superhero movie without it really being superhero pic he has created film noir western that happens be about superhero mangolds love noir westerns bursts screen which those who follow those wonderful stands cinema will come as no surprise having seen with notice his copland 3 10 yuma redux theres perpetual grimness narrative that belies quite often stunning surrounding locales heavy themes such as men out time with destinies written cue deft comic book movie within comic book chunk metaphysics surrogates mental illness human ignorance it goes narrative strong intelligence as much as it is wrought emotion western fans will also be buoyed by part that 1953 classic western shane has play things considerably so as its importance narratively orally visually is mightily strong logans run ah yes well being adult is all well good but is logan thrilling do we get pumped up wolverine action blood brains splatter mucho muscle flexing pained roars anger oh yes action off is never far away wonderfully staged choreographed it is lots memorable set pieces while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as xaviers mind seizures hold court enthral yet kicker with all that is we are clued emotional baggage that side burn sporting protag carries with him with each fight we sense bigger picture even as we watch awe emergence laura ironic film noir name right there as it happens her part this very human story thrills spills are propelled by meaningful but battered heart tech credits are superb acting honours go jackman who after giving 17 years his life character gives it his all this multi faceted performance perfect world deserves oscar recognition patrick stewart also is immense playing nonagenarian charles xavier with such class gracefulness storming emotion that one can only admire film debutante dafne keen as laura is utterly engrossing quite debut indeed whilst stephen merchant as albino mutant tracker caliban is effective point we hanker more although villains fronted by boyd holbrook rote henchman leader richard e grant smarmy scientist git just about pass muster theres nothing damage piece cinematography john mathieson is grade filters set neo noir with splendid film noir black white version fillip heart noir lovers all that is left is sound mix boom director steer with heart brain soul without doubt both come up trumps one 2017s best films genre splicer that ticks all boxes great film making 10 10,0.5133005794910556,0.2714663643235072,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,A reality we normally tend to ignore,"When we have an established movie franchise, things start getting a little monotonous - There's a bad guy who's out to destroy everything the hero stands for, then the hero fights and stops him to save the day. We get happy, cheer for the hero, and later forget all about it. But what if we were once told that the hero we are all cheering for is not there to stay forever? He will die, the new generation will come up, they will remember him for some years and eventually he will be forgotten until someone brings up his topic again.This is exactly what happens in this movie. Unlike the high budget movies Marvel has been making like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, X-Men or Fantastic Four, this one takes place in a grim, dark near future. Everything The X-Men ever stood for has gone. Now it's just an ailing Charles Xavier and Logan, who's working as a limousine driver. They are no longer interested in the adventures they had. There was even a point where Logan sees an X-Men comic and dismisses it saying these are just fake stories. He doesn't care about a legacy, but Charles still does.Logan later meets his daughter, who is to be the next Wolverine. She is in trouble, and Logan must help her cross the border before they get caught. One by one Professor X, and then Wolverine, are killed to ensure his daughter and her friends are safe. The movie finally ends with a realisation that no matter what happens, the cycle of life will carry on whether it's humans or mutants. Everything that is born has to die someday.

10.0,A character-driven superhero film done right!,"LOGAN is brutal, merciless and powerful. This is a character-driven superhero movie done right. I would even dare to say it's better than many of the previous X-Men installments and spinoffs. And if this is indeed Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine movie, then my goodness, what a helluva way to go out in a blaze of glory.The story is set in the near future, mutants are thinning out. They've either died or been hunted down. Logan's (Hugh Jackman) healing power is not as strong as it used to be. He's old and weary and taking care of professor X (Patrick Stewart) in a hideout on the Mexican border, accompanied by Caliban (Stephen Merchant). But their attempt to hide from the world gets interrupted when dark forces arrive at their doorstep looking for a certain young little girl.Great move on the studio's and filmmakers' part to have this film be rated R because what we get here is Wolverine unleashed. The violence is as graphic and fully exposed as you can imagine it to be. So just that aspect alone will excite the fanbase who's been wanting to see the destruction that could take place when Wolverine is really really angry. Setting it on the border does allow the film to play with certain tones and color palette reminiscent to ""Breaking Bad"" for example, the film's ending however does provide a more vibrant environment as a base for an extremely bloody collision.The writing is solid for a superhero film, it really digs deep into these beloved characters, how vulnerable they are, how they long for a world where people would just leave them be. You truly feel for Xavier and Logan in a way that you never did in the previous X-Men movies, not only because they're now in their twilight years but there's also that father-son type of relationship that's tough love and endearing and then there's also the reluctant father daughter connection Logan has with X-23. By the way, the little girl, Dafne Keen, who plays X-23 is remarkable. So much force, so much energy, so much roar, she's like a cheetah that just runs and slices and dices left and right without prejudice, what an incredible young talent. This is a movie that gives you action to its fullest degree and an emotional journey that's uncompromising. The perfect film about the man who's the best at what he does but what he does isn't very nice.",character driven superhero film done right,logan is brutal merciless powerful this is character driven superhero movie done right i would even dare say its better than many previous x men installments spinoffs if this is indeed hugh jackmans final wolverine movie then my goodness what helluva way go out blaze glory story is set near future mutants are thinning out theyve either died or been hunted down logans hugh jackman healing power is not as strong as it used be hes old weary taking care professor x patrick stewart hideout mexican border accompanied by caliban stephen merchant but their attempt hide world gets interrupted when dark forces arrive at their doorstep looking certain young little girl great move studios filmmakers part have this film be rated r because what we get here is wolverine unleashed violence is as graphic fully exposed as you can imagine it be so just that aspect alone will excite fanbase whos been wanting see destruction that could take place when wolverine is really really angry setting it border does allow film play with certain tones color palette reminiscent breaking bad example films ending however does provide more vibrant environment as base extremely bloody collision writing is solid superhero film it really digs deep into these beloved characters how vulnerable they are how they long world where people would just leave them be you truly feel xavier logan way that you never did previous x men movies not only because theyre now their twilight years but theres also that father son type relationship thats tough love endearing then theres also reluctant father daughter connection logan has with x 23 by way little girl dafne keen who plays x 23 is remarkable so much force so much energy so much roar shes like cheetah that just runs slices dices left right without prejudice what incredible young talent this is movie that gives you action its fullest degree emotional journey thats uncompromising perfect film about man whos best at what he does but what he does isnt very nice,0.5354423868312757,0.10348030570252795,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,Just A Flat Out MASTERPIECE!,"Holy Cow! We've finally got the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres. Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be. This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other ""dark"" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves.

So as I watched this, I was pleased that the filmmaker assumed not everyone knew the underlying details. This was exciting. It's obvious that the original crew has fallen on hard times. Wolverine is falling apart. His healing ability is pretty much at its end. He has decided to try to withdraw and let life take its course. But, unfortunately, he is confronted by an evil next step by the lineage of the X-men experiments. This is a wild ride as his ""daughter,"" a clone of him, and he try to find other kids who have been changed and bring them to safety. Of course, the bad guys don't want their escapades to get out. I do have to say that I am really getting tired of all the gore and the endless fighting. Still, it was satisfying.

9.0,Knocked it out of the park,"LOGAN - SPOILER FREE REVIEWAs most of you are aware I have not been a huge fan of the latest X- Men outings, but THIS WAS AWESOME!In a rather bleak entry we see a Post X-Men Logan, something has happened and the mutants no longer exist or there is a few of them out there. Director James Mangold chose to make the film almost colorless with much, much more character development than previous Wolverine and X-Men movies. We see a tired character that no longer belongs in a world that has feared him for over a century.While Hugh Jackman in his last outing as Logan does an amazing job and proves once and for all why NO ONE ELSE can ever be Wolverine, the supporting cast does a superb job as well starting with Sir Patrick Stuart who returns as Charles Xavier, Boyd Holbrook (Netflix's NARCOS) as an astounding and dangerous antagonist and newcomer Dafne Keen who is a rather sweet but incredibly deadly Weapon X-23.The movie is filled with gore and violence, but it does not feel forced at all in such an obscure movie. There is a rather new trend in Comic Book Movies after DEADPOOL, make them as brutal as possible, and while this started in the 90s with THE CROW and BLADE it has gained some track and more R Rated CBM are being developed as we speak.I HIGHLY recommend it.",knocked it out park,logan spoiler free reviewas most you are aware i have not been huge fan latest x men outings but this was awesome rather bleak entry we see post x men logan something has happened mutants no longer exist or there is few them out there director james mangold chose make film almost colorless with much much more character development than previous wolverine x men movies we see tired character that no longer belongs world that has feared him over century while hugh jackman his last outing as logan does amazing job proves once all why no one else can ever be wolverine supporting cast does superb job as well starting with sir patrick stuart who returns as charles xavier boyd holbrook netflixs narcos as astounding dangerous antagonist newcomer dafne keen who is rather sweet but incredibly deadly weapon x 23 movie is filled with gore violence but it does not feel forced at all such obscure movie there is rather new trend comic book movies after deadpool make them as brutal as possible while this started 90s with crow blade it has gained some track more r rated cbm are being developed as we speak i highly recommend it,0.5799315738025416,0.14369990224828935,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Logan is a more than excellent final chapter of the Wolverine saga!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen this several times before. He must have liked this a lot if he agreed to watch it again with me as a first-time viewer. Indeed, this was quite different from many previous Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movies as it's a bit more intense and a little more explicit in language as well. This time, it's a future timeline in which he has to take care of a somewhat sick Charles Xavier (once again, Patrick Stewart) in some desert town while he works as a limo driver. Then a woman asks for his help which he at first refuses before a mysterious little girl appears. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a dramatically compelling narrative with plenty of exciting fight scenes along the way. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Logan.",logan is more than excellent final chapter wolverine saga,just watched this with my movie theatre working friend who had previously seen this several times before he must have liked this lot if he agreed watch it again with me as first time viewer indeed this was quite different many previous hugh jackman wolverine movies as its bit more intense little more explicit language as well this time its future timeline which he has take care somewhat sick charles xavier once again patrick stewart some desert town while he works as limo driver then woman asks his help which he at first refuses before mysterious little girl appears ill stop there just say this was quite dramatically compelling narrative with plenty exciting fight scenes along way so that note me my friend highly recommend logan,0.579223602484472,0.136407867494824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,'Logan' is the 'Wolverine' film we've always wanted!,"For decades now, we have been clamoring for a 'Wolverine' film done right. From his first incarnation in Hulk #181 to his own miniseries in comic book form in the 1980's by Frank Miller, to the amazing Saturday Morning Cartoon, and his first appearance in a feature film in 2000 with 'X-Men', which had the song and dance man Hugh Jackman play the iconic character. He was so good at playing Logan/Wolverine, that fans immediately took a liking to him as that character and he went on to play the 'Snikt-y Snikt' character in almost a dozen more films. Besides the 'X-Men' films, Wolverine got his own set of standalone films, which may or may not have been liked by a lot of people for various reasons. Either the story was too silly or the character Wolverine was to PG for fans.If anyone knows the Wolverine character, it's that he's a brutal, violent, hardcore rated R character, which is something we haven't seen in cinema form at least. That is until now with James Mangold's new film 'Logan', which is very much an R-rated movie, complete with blood, ultra-violence, nudity, and vulgar language. It's everything we've always wanted in a Wolverine movie – FINALLY! With the past three X-Men films, we've seen our favorite X-Men characters growing up as it served as the prequel to the 2000 film. 'LOGAN' is set in the year 2029 and the world has changed for the worst, at least for a mutant friends. This is a very bleak, dark, and violent film with some flashes of dark humor. Nobody is doing well in 2029 here, particularly Logan (Hugh Jackman) who has crawled inside a whisky bottle and has never came back out, with the exception of driving a limo for cash around town. He's old, mean, and his body is starting to fail him. When he's not driving or killing people, he takes care of Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart), who is suffering from seizures and dementia, and who lives in a rusted out, abandoned water tower. Life is not good here for anyone.Meanwhile, a little girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) crosses paths with Logan who seems to have the same abilities as the Wolverine himself. Logan is now charged with the task of transporting this little girl to a safe haven with Charles in tow, as a group of bad guys are after her, led by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). It's a fairly straight forward story and it takes its time setting up these older, dying characters, as well as its new ones. 'LOGAN' doesn't mess about with side tangent plot lines or love interests here. It's balls-to-the-wall, heart breaking action and drama, which is something we've wanted for a long time now with the Wolverine character. The script is written by Scott Frank ('Get Shorty, 'Minority Report') and Michael Green ('Heroes', 'Gotham'), which these two writers have expertly added in a fair dose of emotion into these characters, but never back pedal into past films. It was a breath of fresh air. James Mangold certainly was influenced by some of his favorite old western films, as can be seen in some of camera shots, which are just fantastic.Also, if you ever wanted to see Wolverine go berserk, you'll finally get that here on more than one occasion, complete with some long shots of Wolverine slicing and dicing the bad guys without any cuts. Simply amazing. In the past films, we've seen the characters Professor Xavier and Wolverine rather smart, witty, and put together for the most part. That's not the case here. These two characters are very sick and are not doing well mentally and physically. Jackman and Stewart give award worthy performances here, which might bring a tear or two down your face.

6.0,Such a sad farewell.,"I really can't get how in the world people are rating this movie as highly as they are. You would think they have never seen this done, and done better.Yes, I understand that Logan is a heartfelt character dear to us, but THINK people! For that very same reason we should be holding this movie to a higher standard, and not giving it an emotional pass.To, me, this film was slow and depressing a-la No Country For Old Men, without ANY of the Oscar-worthiness. It was just droll, SUPER PREDICTABLE, moronic in its' execution and so very far-fetched. (Yes, imagine saying 'far-fetched' for a movie based on a comic)! They spun and bent a bunch of things to get them to where they were in the year 2029 and tried to make it believable (it wasn't). Then, they try to impress upon your heartstrings Logan's connection or ties to the little girl, but the connection or ties are SILLY at best. Not only the supposed ties between them are silly, but the entire plot is full of silly holes.Not SILLY, you say? Let me get this straight ... you are trying like hell to get away from the bad guys, and ummmmm, you STOP FOR A MINI VACATION - not ONCE, but TWICE, and put hundreds of strangers in jeopardy the first time, and a nice family in danger the second time? Yeah, sure. Seriously, anyone who could get over that gaping ridiculousness and who can, after that, in good conscience give this movie anything above a 6 is just messing with you or has total fan-boy blinders on. As for the little girl, god, she was annoying and aggravating AF and 80% of her screen time was spent shrieking. Nooo, not screaming. SHRIEKING.The rest of the acting was good. The members of the family they added as filler in the middle of the movie were the only ones IMO that you kind of cared about. Even old Professor X had seen better days and you kind of wanted it to be over for him. It was just painful to watch, and I don't mean in a moving way where the film is made better, but in a painful oh god, kill him off already way.*** BIG SPOILERS BELOW *** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE OR ARE PLANNING ON SEEING IT!!!The ending was unreal in how bad it was. Without giving too much away ... you have one little girl who is able to take out like 10-12 guys, PLUS you have Wolverine, PLUS a BUNCH of other mutant kids who have varying degrees of mutant abilities, and yet they can't take out a small group of bad guys? W T H ?As for Hugh Jackman, he was good and played Logan like he always has done except maybe this time he looked older and more tired which was a good thing because it translated unto the screen and gave Wolverine some credibility. Otherwise he was just there. The gushing over his acting this time around IMO is unwarranted, as he really didn't do anything that much different than he has on every other X-Men movie and if anyone disagrees, I defy them to point out what. Props also to the action in the film, and to how it was filmed. The action scenes alone are what I imagine 'made' the movie for most people. All in all, I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't a horribly BAD movie, I just don't agree that it was very good and I really don't agree with the overrating or the assessment that it is in ANY way a ""masterpiece"". If you look at it just on paper, you would think that the people that are reacting to it in such a way have ONLY EVER watched comic-book movies in their lives and have now seen a drama sold as a comic-book movie and their brains are exploding as they process it as innovative and different.In closing, I understand that Hugh Jackman is getting older, and the great dilemma was 'how exactly do you keep making movies with an actor who is aging, playing a character who is supposed to rejuvenate or heal'? You don't. You kindly retire the character, as the creators of the franchise have chosen to do. The thing is, they could have really made it to where it wasn't SO depressing and/or bleak with no real outlook toward the future except a bunch of kids you are NOT at all INVESTED in, or care one iota about. A bad ending for a good character, was just bad cinema. RIP Logan. hopefully, at some point you will miraculously resurrect so that you can be given the farewell you deserve. My actual rating is 6.5-7/10, but some reviewers have gone over the top crazy with the 10s.",such sad farewell,i really cant get how world people are rating this movie as highly as they are you would think they have never seen this done done better yes i understand that logan is heartfelt character dear us but think people that very same reason we should be holding this movie higher standard not giving it emotional pass me this film was slow depressing la no country old men without any oscar worthiness it was just droll super predictable moronic its execution so very far fetched yes imagine saying far fetched movie based comic they spun bent bunch things get them where they were year 2029 tried make it believable it wasnt then they try impress upon your heartstrings logans connection or ties little girl but connection or ties are silly at best not only supposed ties between them are silly but entire plot is full silly holes not silly you say let me get this straight you are trying like hell get away bad guys ummmmm you stop mini vacation not once but twice put hundreds strangers jeopardy first time nice family danger second time yeah sure seriously anyone who could get over that gaping ridiculousness who can after that good conscience give this movie anything above 6 is just messing with you or has total fan boy blinders as little girl god she was annoying aggravating af 80 her screen time was spent shrieking nooo not screaming shrieking rest acting was good members family they added as filler middle movie were only ones imo that you kind cared about even old professor x had seen better days you kind wanted it be over him it was just painful watch i dont mean moving way where film is made better but painful oh god kill him off already way big spoilers below do not read if you have not seen movie or are planning seeing it ending was unreal how bad it was without giving too much away you have one little girl who is able take out like 10 12 guys plus you have wolverine plus bunch other mutant kids who have varying degrees mutant abilities yet they cant take out small group bad guys w t h as hugh jackman he was good played logan like he always has done except maybe this time he looked older more tired which was good thing because it translated unto screen gave wolverine some credibility otherwise he was just there gushing over his acting this time around imo is unwarranted as he really didnt do anything that much different than he has every other x men movie if anyone disagrees i defy them point out what props also action film how it was filmed action scenes alone are what i imagine made movie most people all all i wasnt impressed dont get me wrong it wasnt horribly bad movie i just dont agree that it was very good i really dont agree with overrating or assessment that it is any way masterpiece if you look at it just paper you would think that people that are reacting it such way have only ever watched comic book movies their lives have now seen drama sold as comic book movie their brains are exploding as they process it as innovative different closing i understand that hugh jackman is getting older great dilemma was how exactly do you keep making movies with actor who is aging playing character who is supposed rejuvenate or heal you dont you kindly retire character as creators franchise have chosen do thing is they could have really made it where it wasnt so depressing or bleak with no real outlook toward future except bunch kids you are not at all invested or care one iota about bad ending good character was just bad cinema rip logan hopefully at some point you will miraculously resurrect so that you can be given farewell you deserve my actual rating is 6 5 7 10 but some reviewers have gone over top crazy with 10s,0.5572446689113357,0.04907407407407409,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,Re-tiring,"The Wolverine movies did not have much luck. While we got used to Hugh Jackman and his performance will be burned in our heads, the stand-alone movies never really stood out that much. Well that is until Logan came along. And Logan has another member of the X-Men family in it, portrayed by Patrick Stewart in this case. And while Logan/Wolverine does not age, both are retired.A broken down Logan takes care of his former mentor and Professor at the Mutants Academy/school. Especially the Professor has lost a lot of his power (no pun intended). Those two are forced (you could have guessed that even without seeing the trailer) to go on one last road trip. And they have to because of a young girl. And while Logan seems not to care, circumstances do not leave him much choice.There are battles, there is drama and it is one of the best X-Men movies that has been made. There is also a lot of violence. This may be a comic book adaptation, but it certainly does not shy away from the brutality of its source. And this rawness helps it elevate, helps it become even more emotional, in more than one instance. Set in the future this is a good movie to end the Wolverine ....

8.0,bloody hardness,"It's 2029. Mutants in America have been hunted to almost extinction. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a dying drunk and driving a limo. He is caring for Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is losing control of his powers and his sanity. Logan is approached by Gabriela for help to care for a little girl named Laura. They're on the run from a corporation which created Laura and other mutant children to be super-soldiers. Its thugs are looking to recapture the escaped subjects.The movie is hard and bloody. It mines the well-worn relationship between Logan and Professor X bringing a feral little girl into the mix. The connection is ingrained. It takes the superhero joy of violence and makes it brutal. I would have liked a little more jokey humor between odd couple Logan and X.

8.0,emotionally it gets it so right that one can mostly look over story flaws,"I have to wonder how people will react to Logan even a year from now, much less years from now, when some of the story flaws in this become more apparent. Some of the things in Logan may seem like nitpicking (how does one drive a bullet-ridden limo through Texas into Oklahoma, for example, without anyone noticing until the minute it's pulled up to the hotel to be uh parked), some things may be sort of griping about the logistics of things (i.e. the comic book of X-Men is a plot element in this movie, like the X-Men comics exist, which would be a clever meta moment if it wasn't in the midst of the one of the darkest comic book movies ever made), and there are other beats that just have to do with how quickly (or, really, not) the villains don't catch up with our trio of main characters, Logan, Xavier and Julia, even when they literally have the coordinates to get to them. Not to mention some things in the last third of the movie that make things while not necessarily less violent or intense, a little more standard as a comic book movie, certainly as it's the 10th film in 17 years with an X-Men character from Fox.All of this noted... this movie is really good. The reason for that is James Mangold, the director, taking a second (ahem, sorry, I can't resist) stab at this character and as it's the end he takes almost a rough R-rated Clint Eastwood 70's Peckinpah spaghetti-ish western approach to it all. And this is an BIG R rating, so parents take note, if you don't care about your kids hearing ""F"" and ""S"" words (and there's a lot of them, it's not like this got the rating for going over the 1 or 2 time minimum of PG-13 movies), then you might care about the various dismemberments, beheadings, stabs through the head, repeated stabbings *from children* onto nameless bad guys. Or maybe that won't be an issue either; in that case this is a dark tragic western for the whole family about a mutant who is slowly dying from adamantium poisoning driving his 90 year old dementia-ish father figure with a little girl so they can find a possible Eden. If one feels a Children of Men vibe too I wouldn't say that was unintentional.But alongside Mangold's commitment to going for something we haven't seen before, what matters most in these movies to me more than the plot or stories more-often - the interactions of the characters, the emotional weight, how characters do (or don't) grow since, you know, once an a-hole always an a-hole - that works spectacularly. This is maybe the most deeply felt of the X-Men films, or at least as close as Days of Future Past was, as far as showing us how these characters are in great pain and danger and grappling with things, but we also get to see more dimension than before. With Xavier, for example, a lot of time in past movies (certainly the first three) while played by an actor with gravitas like Stewart, he was an exposition machine. Here, Xavier gets to show anger, resentment, sadness, pain, misery, confusion (genuinely, remember he's 90 here), and even a moment where he gets to help a farmer coral his horses (it's a minor but important one). And damn if Stewart doesn't deliver the goods; I can praise Jackman high as he does deserve it, and the young newcomer playing the mutant Julia is incredible (mostly in how she listens and her subtle moments in silences), this is Oscar-worthy s*** from Stewart.So I think if you have really enjoyed most over the years how the actors and characters have interacted the most, regardless (or regardful) of how it strays from the comics (a touch that gets commented on here, for better or worse), Logan gives that score with moving fashion. If you are interested in a coherent story, that's here too... up to a point. It's a good send off for these characters.",emotionally it gets it so right that one can mostly look over story flaws,i have wonder how people will react logan even year now much less years now when some story flaws this become more apparent some things logan may seem like nitpicking how does one drive bullet ridden limo through texas into oklahoma example without anyone noticing until minute its pulled up hotel be uh parked some things may be sort griping about logistics things i e comic book x men is plot element this movie like x men comics exist which would be clever meta moment if it wasnt midst one darkest comic book movies ever made there are other beats that just have do with how quickly or really not villains dont catch up with our trio main characters logan xavier julia even when they literally have coordinates get them not mention some things last third movie that make things while not necessarily less violent or intense little more standard as comic book movie certainly as its 10th film 17 years with x men character fox all this noted this movie is really good reason that is james mangold director taking second ahem sorry i cant resist stab at this character as its end he takes almost rough r rated clint eastwood 70s peckinpah spaghetti ish western approach it all this is big r rating so parents take note if you dont care about your kids hearing f s words theres lot them its not like this got rating going over 1 or 2 time minimum pg 13 movies then you might care about various dismemberments beheadings stabs through head repeated stabbings children onto nameless bad guys or maybe that wont be issue either that case this is dark tragic western whole family about mutant who is slowly dying adamantium poisoning driving his 90 year old dementia ish father figure with little girl so they can find possible eden if one feels children men vibe too i wouldnt say that was unintentional but alongside mangolds commitment going something we havent seen before what matters most these movies me more than plot or stories more often interactions characters emotional weight how characters do or dont grow since you know once hole always hole that works spectacularly this is maybe most deeply felt x men films or at least as close as days future past was as far as showing us how these characters are great pain danger grappling with things but we also get see more dimension than before with xavier example lot time past movies certainly first three while played by actor with gravitas like stewart he was exposition machine here xavier gets show anger resentment sadness pain misery confusion genuinely remember hes 90 here even moment where he gets help farmer coral his horses its minor but important one damn if stewart doesnt deliver goods i can praise jackman high as he does deserve it young newcomer playing mutant julia is incredible mostly how she listens her subtle moments silences this is oscar worthy s stewart so i think if you have really enjoyed most over years how actors characters have interacted most regardless or regardful how it strays comics touch that gets commented here better or worse logan gives that score with moving fashion if you are interested coherent story thats here too up point its good send off these characters,0.48977513227513214,0.11194444444444443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,"An ""X-Men"" movie for the adult audience...","Now, first and foremost I must stand forth and say that superhero movies is not my go-to pick of movies when presented with alternate choices. Why? Well, because I just don't really enjoy the superhero theme all that much. Usually, they provide nothing more than visual entertainment for me.However, I will say that ""Logan"" manages to stand out in the superhero genre; a genre that is well-diluted with mediocre attempts of bringing comic book heroes to life on the big screen. ""Logan"", however, steps away from the absurdly generic mould that superhero movies tend to follow, and it is not the superhuman powers of the characters that is the drive behind the movie.What makes ""Logan"" so good and entertaining, is that this is a movie intended for a mature audience, and it leaves the generic superhero archetype behind as it has been seen in most previous ""X-Men"" movies. With that being said, I will also continue on to state that ""Logan"" is actually the best of all the installments into the ""X-Men"" universe on the big screen so far.This is a movie that is driven by a good story, and spiced up with good characters and good acting all around. This is also the most violent and bloody of all the ""X-Men"" movies, take it as it is, like it or dislike it - that is a personal preference, of course. I did, however, enjoy the approach and the more dark atmosphere that permeated this entire movie. It was refreshing not to see a rose-tinted superhero movie where you know that the heroes will prevail against insurmountable odds.Sure, the effects in ""Logan"" are great, and they do help the movie along quite nicely.I was more than genuinely surprised with how good ""Logan"" turned out to be, and this movie does have enough entertainment contents to sustain multiple viewings. My rating for ""Logan"" is 8 out of 10 stars, without a doubt.

,A Gritty & Emotional Adventure Into The Vulnerability Of Superheroes,"In a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time- and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside due to their fresh take on the genre), it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully- executed as 'Logan' is made. I mean let's face it, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.I understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously, such as they have tried with the Avengers films, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously, and pulls it off with such precision, as they did here in 'Logan', a film that focuses more on the ""humane"" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X-Men Origins' I'm looking at you).Two characters that we've come to know and love, James ""Wolverine"" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles ""Professor X"" Xavier, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state, once characters that resembled strength and power, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching, adrenaline- pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is 'The Wolverine'.I think it's the uncertainty throughout that gives the film that powerful punch. In the other X-Men films (and most other Marvel films for that), we are faced with a plethora of superheroes each fighting a seemingly impossible army, but no matter what, there is always a general feeling that the good guys will win, and this usually happens. So when attending a superhero film, you sit back in ease, knowing the protagonists will succeed, however in 'Logan' that never happens, there is never that sense of safety, we can't be certain of their outcomes. Every step of the way, Wolverine looks tired, he looks sick, he's dying gradually, and due to his weakened form, we are left worrying for the character, there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack. This is the harrowing truth throughout, we are emotionally-concerned from start to finish.With utterly stunning cinematography, a hard-hitting score, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar- deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date, a gritty and vulnerable adventure into the vulnerability of superheroes.",gritty emotional adventure into vulnerability superheroes,time when marvel continues churn out same superhero film time time again deadpool guardians aside due their fresh take genre its refreshing when something as intricate beautifully executed as logan is made i mean lets face it that first trailer was dead giveaway how damn good it was going be i understand that marvel has made attempt build characters through series films previously such as they have tried with avengers films but never have i seen film that treats character development as seriously pulls it off with such precision as they did here logan film that focuses more humane aspect character how vulnerable he is as superhero instead over top execution thats usually featured x men origins im looking at you two characters that weve come know love james wolverine howlett aka logan charles professor x xavier are put test time as we see them their new state once characters that resembled strength power are now withering vulnerable gut punching adrenaline pumping action has been swapped out slow moving emotional drama character development does it work you bet start finish we are led journey discovery empathy with james mangold more than making up his previous effort that is wolverine i think its uncertainty throughout that gives film that powerful punch other x men films most other marvel films that we are faced with plethora superheroes each fighting seemingly impossible army but no matter what there is always general feeling that good guys will win this usually happens so when attending superhero film you sit back ease knowing protagonists will succeed however logan that never happens there is never that sense safety we cant be certain their outcomes every step way wolverine looks tired he looks sick hes dying gradually due his weakened form we are left worrying character there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack this is harrowing truth throughout we are emotionally concerned start finish with utterly stunning cinematography hard hitting score fantastic direction superhero performance that might just be first oscar deserving one ever wolverines outing makes best marvel film date gritty vulnerable adventure into vulnerability superheroes,0.5285336518827085,0.08755717552887364,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
