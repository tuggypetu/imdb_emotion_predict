,"High energy and wonderfully excessive as it delivers an engaging true story, but the lack of morality anywhere was a limiting factor","This film arrived in the UK with awards and Oscar nominations all around it, adding an expectation which it really didn't need adding since even without any of that it is ultimately a Scorsese film with a big name cast. It also arrives with some other stuff because the film has been criticized for near glamorization of the excesses that Belfort was able to experience with his ill-gotten funds and, to be honest, it is an impression that isn't helped when you consider that this film was put forward to the Golden Globes in the Musical/Comedy section. Now I am sure that was a political move by the studio, but it does say something about the film because indeed for most of it we have stuff so unbelievable and so excessive that it is hard not to laugh at it. It is hard not to enjoy it.And this is a problem, because the first 2 hours and a bit of this film is really engaging and enchanting in how much of a rush it gives you, how enticing it is and just how much vibrant energy it all has. The viewer is swept along and I guess to a point this is the film doing its job well because not only are we being told a story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is to get caught up in the grab for success, for money, for status. In this regard the film works really well because throughout the film I really was glad to be part of it and wanted it for myself; I don't think the film goes out of its way to glamorize this excess and this life, but for sure it doesn't do much to balance it – and this really is my problem with the film.The structure, subjects and delivery of this film is so inherently similar to Goodfellas that it is hard not to mention it. If you remember the opening of Goodfellas you'll remember that it opens with a memorably violent scene where an near-dead man in the back of a car is stabbed by Hill and his colleagues in a scene that is oppressive and violent but yet ends with the narration telling us ""as far back as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster"" and snaps to credits under a big track from Tony Bennett. This scene is important because it works as a microcosm of the whole film – the appeal but also the cost, all in one place. Wolf of Wall Street never has any of that and it hurts it. I suspect the message of the film is that our financial systems are screwed and that ultimately the rich will never be in the same world as the average person, because this is what I took from the rather sobering final scenes. However if this is the point it is trying to make then it really hurts itself with the rest of the film seeming to say ""so why not get on board"". I know this is not the case but the lack of a ""point"" or an agenda it the film means that it naturally fills it with its own, which is a weird feeling.But then again – I guess it is a comedy. So the infamous Quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious, the scenes of excess and of criminality are not equally appealing and repulsive – they are almost totally appealing, we hardly get the other side or get to see a victim here, and a few seconds on the subway with the FBI agent really does nothing but yet again make the suggestion that ""it's all broken so why not at least get rich yourself"". Getting away from this, it is a well made film. Scorsese makes this award season's second film to owe a massive debt to Goodfellas (American Hustle being the other) and he directs the film with energy; music is used well as one would expect and the editing makes the film pop. DiCaprio is great in the lead – OK he doesn't find the heart of the character, but the film doesn't ask him to. Instead he is charismatic and energetic, drawing the viewer in and giving the film its energy. The supporting cast is deep with names and familiar faces and it is a statement about how well the film holds the viewer, because it isn't distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character from TV appear (although I did notice that this and American Hustle had lots of faces from HBO's Boardwalk Empire). Jonah Hill is over the top in a way that works, although I am surprised to see him getting an Oscar nomination for it in such a crowded year.Wolf of Wall Street has had a lot of praise and this will continue as the Oscars approach and are awarded. Personally I enjoyed the film as a funny true story delivered with energy and excess but in many ways it is not Goodfellas and the most important of these is that the film lacks a moral core to itself, to its characters and to its message. I don't mind the ""it's all screwed so who cares"" message that it ultimately seems to give, but I didn't feel comfortable with how wide a smile it had on its face while it was delivering it.",high energy wonderfully excessive as it delivers engaging true story but lack morality anywhere was limiting factor,this film arrived uk with awards oscar nominations all around it adding expectation which it really didnt need adding since even without any that it is ultimately scorsese film with big name cast it also arrives with some other stuff because film has been criticized near glamorization excesses that belfort was able experience with his ill gotten funds be honest it is impression that isnt helped when you consider that this film was put forward golden globes musical comedy section now i am sure that was political move by studio but it does say something about film because indeed most it we have stuff so unbelievable so excessive that it is hard not laugh at it it is hard not enjoy it this is problem because first 2 hours bit this film is really engaging enchanting how much rush it gives you how enticing it is just how much vibrant energy it all has viewer is swept along i guess point this is film doing its job well because not only are we being told story but we are first hand seeing how easy it is get caught up grab success money status this regard film works really well because throughout film i really was glad be part it wanted it myself i dont think film goes out its way glamorize this excess this life but sure it doesnt do much balance it this really is my problem with film structure subjects delivery this film is so inherently similar goodfellas that it is hard not mention it if you remember opening goodfellas youll remember that it opens with memorably violent scene where near dead man back car is stabbed by hill his colleagues scene that is oppressive violent but yet ends with narration telling us as far back as i can remember i wanted be gangster snaps credits under big track tony bennett this scene is important because it works as microcosm whole film appeal but also cost all one place wolf wall street never has any that it hurts it i suspect message film is that our financial systems are screwed that ultimately rich will never be same world as average person because this is what i took rather sobering final scenes however if this is point it is trying make then it really hurts itself with rest film seeming say so why not get board i know this is not case but lack point or agenda it film means that it naturally fills it with its own which is weird feeling but then again i guess it is comedy so infamous quaalude scene is not horrific but rather hilarious scenes excess criminality are not equally appealing repulsive they are almost totally appealing we hardly get other side or get see victim here few seconds subway with fbi agent really does nothing but yet again make suggestion that its all broken so why not at least get rich yourself getting away this it is well made film scorsese makes this award seasons second film owe massive debt goodfellas american hustle being other he directs film with energy music is used well as one would expect editing makes film pop dicaprio is great lead ok he doesnt find heart character but film doesnt ask him instead he is charismatic energetic drawing viewer giving film its energy supporting cast is deep with names familiar faces it is statement about how well film holds viewer because it isnt distracting no matter how many famous faces or supporting character tv appear although i did notice that this american hustle had lots faces hbos boardwalk empire jonah hill is over top way that works although i am surprised see him getting oscar nomination it such crowded year wolf wall street has had lot praise this will continue as oscars approach are awarded personally i enjoyed film as funny true story delivered with energy excess but many ways it is not goodfellas most important these is that film lacks moral core itself its characters its message i dont mind its all screwed so who cares message that it ultimately seems give but i didnt feel comfortable with how wide smile it had its face while it was delivering it,0.5334277777777776,0.12118333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,SELL ME THIS PEN,"Golden Globe winner Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the title role of Jordan Belfort. Belfort works his way up the ladder making money in penny stocks, i.e. ""selling garbage to garbage men."" His scheme is to sell these garbage stocks to rich investors due to the high commissions. Along the way he does some illegal transactions as he runs his corporation like a frat party in ""Animal House."" Having not known money, he and his crew are ill equipped to handle it.I thought that Jonah Hill gave one of his best performances. The production is awfully long, not wanting to miss out on any details. The film goes into detail to explain to the audience things like IPO and the history and effects of quaaludes. If you note the ludes he took early in the film were crumbly. Those were non-prescription ludes made from a pill press in uncle Vinnie's garage and not too potent. Later they score some real ludes. Having taken the fake ones for so long, they didn't know how to handle them causing them to crash, like the money it was too much too fast.The main criticism of the film is that it featured over 500 F-bombs. It really didn't seem like that many due to the length of the production. Besides you get numb to it after the first few hundred or so.",sell me this pen,golden globe winner leonardo dicaprio stars title role jordan belfort belfort works his way up ladder making money penny stocks i e selling garbage garbage men his scheme is sell these garbage stocks rich investors due high commissions along way he does some illegal transactions as he runs his corporation like frat party animal house having not known money he his crew are ill equipped handle it i thought that jonah hill gave one his best performances production is awfully long not wanting miss out any details film goes into detail explain audience things like ipo history effects quaaludes if you note ludes he took early film were crumbly those were non prescription ludes made pill press uncle vinnies garage not too potent later they score some real ludes having taken fake ones so long they didnt know how handle them causing them crash like money it was too much too fast main criticism film is that it featured over 500 f bombs it really didnt seem like that many due length production besides you get numb it after first few hundred or so,0.4568115942028985,0.06528985507246376,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"

9.0,"""Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.""","It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made.",money is oxygen capitalism i wanna breathe more than any other human being alive,its no surprise that scorsese is associated with gangster genre with films such as departed goodfellas casino which last two are possibly best pure examples genre goodfellas gangsters are dangerous but they operate more underground level casino they practically run major city can do whatever they like gangsters were will always be part americas system now gangsters are not just accepted by system but are considered be integral part it first two films gangster is threatening dangerous but avoidable wolf wall street hes calling hustle you at home you dont even know it some people view wolf wall street as glorification jordan belforts lifestyle want be like him as scorsese portrays this life by its nature enticing thats way it works its impossible portray it accurately without showing how charismatic man like belfort can suck unsuspecting person into world money fame film though shows us just how empty destructive that life can be there is undeniable similarity between instantaneous joy energy euphoria that we have while watching wolf wall street how jordan belfort lives his life this is movie where director skillfully mixes form content create experience which is as hyper as instantly ecstatic as life its flashy opportunistic characters direction by martin scorsese which still has infectious energy power is impeccable there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has this is three hour movie that moves lightning fast always manages keep audience invested story throughout whole duration each scene is packed with so much visual information it is fast paced quickly edited which complements general tone film cinematography by rodrigo prieto is gorgeous as well displays optimal color palette throughout whole film each shot also looks precise even during some more chaotic scenes script is fantastic filled with many great memorable lines dialogue every character has well defined arc motives story is given proper breathing room blossom performances are also exquisite especially leonardo dicaprio who gives one best performances his career portrays opportunistic nature jordan belforts character with great commitment as you can see lustful hedonistic impulsive sex drug addict man who only wants have more fun supporting him with equal passion is jonah hill as donnie azoff belforts sidekick even he manages make mark his own margot robbie plays naomi belforts second wife she does alluring job her given role matthew mcconaughey is very short duration as mark hanna belforts mentor but even that little time he is show stealer he dominates screen unlike anyone else martin scorsese terence winter set out create film about wall street excess by definition it contains excessive amount everything such as cursing sex nudity drugs alcohol partying but film is not really about those things story wolf wall street boils down money that most addictive drug belfort speaks not just what it can buy but what it can do people not just how it changes ones lifestyle but effects it has ones morals beliefs values how it can effectively change not just how person thinks feels but how they operate at their core with collection truly incredible films wolf wall street stands out as one scorseses best films my personal favorite by far his most humorous film date he truly went all out it paid off hilarious satire reverence money drugs women admiration criminal money maker wolf wall street is maddening cinema thats already high coke but still continues snort more white powder every 5 minutes 3 hours this is fascinating vignette excess greed abuse decay its one best movies decade surely one most entertaining movies ever made,0.5676334776334774,0.25776489383632245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career.,"In the mid-1990s, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery, their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires, and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the memoir of the same name.Under most circumstances, the actions of Belfort and his cronies (including Jonah Hill in a howlingly funny turn as Belfort's business partner) would be viewed as disgustingly abhorrent, but Martin Scorsese frames this tale of greed with a comedic lens that allows us to laugh at things we probably shouldn't find humorous. Whether it's a clumsy attempt at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes, or the categorization of prostitutes using stock market terminology (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and typically accept credit cards), the film is outrageous from start to finish, and rarely falters in its quest to entertain the audience for three hours.Belfort manages to delude himself and his pals into thinking they can live like this forever, but the audience knows better, and Belfort's eventual comeuppance is hardly surprising. But the path is paved with hilarity, especially in a scene aboard the mogul's luxury yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a pair of FBI agents everything from booze to girls to cold hard cash in exchange for their silence. And let's not forget his punishment for drunkenly piloting a helicopter into the backyard of his estate at 3am, raising the ire of his trophy wife (Margot Robbie).Scorsese has always managed to elicit astounding performances from his actors, and his fifth collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio results in one of the most charismatic, despicable, offensive and captivating characters to ever appear on screen. As financial bad boy Belfort, DiCaprio swaggers from scene to scene ingesting eye-popping amounts of narcotics, groping and fondling nearly every female within reach, and spouting more profanity in three hours than an entire season of The Sopranos. Belfort is the kind of person that any sane person would detest in real life, but thanks to Scorses and DiCaprio, we can't take our eyes off him.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",dicaprio gives best performance his career,mid 1990s jordan belfort leonardo dicaprio rest his associates brokerage firm stratton oakmont became very definition excess debauchery their offices boiler room fueled by cocaine greed high pressure sales tactic less than legal behind scenes manipulation bred plenty twenty something millionaires belfort built himself empire at top heap his rise fall is chronicled wolf wall street based memoir same name under most circumstances actions belfort his cronies including jonah hill howlingly funny turn as belforts business partner would be viewed as disgustingly abhorrent but martin scorsese frames this tale greed with comedic lens that allows us laugh at things we probably shouldnt find humorous whether its clumsy attempt at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing quaaludes or categorization prostitutes using stock market terminology blue chip hookers make you wear condom typically accept credit cards film is outrageous start finish rarely falters its quest entertain audience three hours belfort manages delude himself his pals into thinking they can live like this forever but audience knows better belforts eventual comeuppance is hardly surprising but path is paved with hilarity especially scene aboard moguls luxury yacht where he surreptitiously offers pair fbi agents everything booze girls cold hard cash exchange their silence lets not forget his punishment drunkenly piloting helicopter into backyard his estate at 3am raising ire his trophy wife margot robbie scorsese has always managed elicit astounding performances his actors his fifth collaboration with leonardo dicaprio results one most charismatic despicable offensive captivating characters ever appear screen as financial bad boy belfort dicaprio swaggers scene scene ingesting eye popping amounts narcotics groping fondling nearly every female within reach spouting more profanity three hours than entire season sopranos belfort is kind person that any sane person would detest real life but thanks scorses dicaprio we cant take our eyes off him brent hankins www nerdrep com,0.5182916666666666,0.11303409090909093,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"

9.0,The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio's Crowning Work,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up.

8.0,Reserved for the male of the species,"The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.Leonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, each of who lived large in his own way with power, DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it's the realization of the American dream, DiCaprio the middle class kid wants to go on Wall Street. He goes, but then is one of thousands cast adrift by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not about to give up his dream.He organizes his own brokerage house, similar to what is seen in the more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill, these guys and I do mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn't look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did.",reserved male species,wolf wall street details rise fall real life one jordan belfort who while was living high wide off other peoples money it was good while it lasted until some relentless fbi agents took him down partly because his own hubris leonardo dicaprio as he did with such other real life figures like howard hughes j edgar hoover each who lived large his own way with power dicaprio lives large with money at first its realization american dream dicaprio middle class kid wants go wall street he goes but then is one thousands cast adrift by stock market crash late reagan years dicaprio is not about give up his dream he organizes his own brokerage house similar what is seen more modestly financed film boiler room but dicaprio takes it far penny stock outfit with collection his own ill assorted bunch friends chief among them is jonah hill these guys i do mean it is reserved male species dicaprio makes obscene amounts money spends it obscenely that is sure attract all kinds law enforcement attention i have seen very few films that have depicted alpha male world so well women just do not compete dicaprios world all they serve as are sex objects women work wall street more traditional brokerage houses but not with him where being one boys is first requirement world consists 50 orgies 50 piling up paper profits later hiding them authorities true dicaprio true lesser extent all his associates martin scorsese directed this film handled film like he did one his gangster epics like goodfellas narration film is by dicaprio it takes you his rise where law enforcement has him between rock hard place like ray liotta goodfellas combination drugs hubris makes him think hes invulnerable but goodfellas would not have had scene where wise guys just out out dared challenge fbi as dicaprio does with agent kyle chandler it so reminded me that famous incident 1984 where presidential candidate gary hart dares reporters follow him around catch him doing anything outside his marriage course they did five oscar nominations went wolf wall street nominations best picture best director best adapted screenplay nominations dicaprio jonah hill as best actor best supporting actor hill was something revelation kind nondescript character that you wouldnt look at twice hill gets taken world that he could only imagine dreams wet or dry by dicaprio his own hill is almost as fascinating story as dicaprio guy who beat leo out best actor has brief but telling role as mentor sorts matthew mcconaughey plays stockbroker who takes him under his wing they have great scene at club where hes getting his first three martini lunch mcconaughey only forgets teach dicaprio one thing discretion i can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns male power game but wolf wall street gives us fascinating look at man who tried play with big boys stock exchange while did,0.5125757020757021,0.2346489621489621,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,"What happens when you follow your basest instinct, every time you can, for years?","Jordan Belfort(DiCaprio, playing a charismatic jerk. Really glad he and Martin found each other, they bring out the best in each other) is a stockbroker, with incredibly low morals, even by those standards. He finds ways to trick people into buying what he's selling, and quickly starts to make obscene amounts of money. How long can he possibly keep that going?If Scorsese has directed a bad film, then I don't know of it. Then again, I have heard that the Irishman feels like it takes as many years to watch as they deaged the leads by. While this one does substitute violence for debauchery, it does play a lot like one of his gangster biographies. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. No reason for him to stay away from his old bag of tricks. There's a lot of narration, since there are simply too many details to ""show, don't tell"" everything. Most of it voice-over, some of it breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the camera - occasionally it will be very Deadpool, even though this beat that movie to theatres by three years. We get quirky types of people(Margot Robbie was an excellent find, and it's really no wonder that she's been in as hot a name in Hollywood as she has been since this, despite some of them not being all that well received). Depicting very carefully approached lawbreaking, where we can understand how, and why, it works.I've heard some criticise these movies, saying that they romanticise these obviously unethical behaviours. Pointing out that a lot of attention to detail is put into showing the positive experiences they have specifically because of the awful things they do. My argument against that has always been that that's only the first chunk of these pictures. They are also very careful to show the eventual downfall. Unless you walk out early, clearly the message of these is that, though you might get away with it early on, in the long term it will destroy you and the people around you. In this flick especially, the way things gradually fall apart is a sight to behold. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine. Or that amazing dominoes bit from V for Vendetta. It's hard for me to overstate just how well constructed, and how fun to watch, it is. One sequence, dealing with a car, several phones, and some unforeseen consequences, made me laugh harder than I have at comedies for several years.This features a lot of nudity, sexuality, drug use and strong language, as well as some violence. I recommend this to anyone that the excellent trailer appeals to. 8/10.",what happens when you follow your basest instinct every time you can years,jordan belfort dicaprio playing charismatic jerk really glad he martin found each other they bring out best each other is stockbroker with incredibly low morals even by those standards he finds ways trick people into buying what hes selling quickly starts make obscene amounts money how long can he possibly keep that going if scorsese has directed bad film then i dont know it then again i have heard that irishman feels like it takes as many years watch as they deaged leads by while this one does substitute violence debauchery it does play lot like one his gangster biographies if it aint broke dont fix it no reason him stay away his old bag tricks theres lot narration since there are simply too many details show dont tell everything most it voice over some it breaking fourth wall talking directly camera occasionally it will be very deadpool even though this beat that movie theatres by three years we get quirky types people margot robbie was excellent find its really no wonder that shes been as hot name hollywood as she has been since this despite some them not being all that well received depicting very carefully approached lawbreaking where we can understand how why it works ive heard some criticise these movies saying that they romanticise these obviously unethical behaviours pointing out that lot attention detail is put into showing positive experiences they have specifically because awful things they do my argument against that has always been that thats only first chunk these pictures they are also very careful show eventual downfall unless you walk out early clearly message these is that though you might get away with it early long term it will destroy you people around you this flick especially way things gradually fall apart is sight behold its like rube goldberg machine or that amazing dominoes bit v vendetta its hard me overstate just how well constructed how fun watch it is one sequence dealing with car several phones some unforeseen consequences made me laugh harder than i have at comedies several years this features lot nudity sexuality drug use strong language as well as some violence i recommend this anyone that excellent trailer appeals 8 10,0.5130206830206829,0.130939393939394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.24}"
,Scorsese and DiCaprio Make Another Masterpiece,"The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)**** (out of 4) Two word review: A Masterpice.Martin Scorsese's latest film is yet another brilliant one with Leonard DiCaprio turning in the greatest performance of his career as stockbroker Jordan Belfort who takes some rather bland people and turn them into one of the biggest scams that the FBI ever saw. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is going to make many people unhappy and there are many more who are probably going to be offended by it but the perfection that is Scorsese was right when he decided to turn this into a comedy instead of a drama. Yeah, it's GOODFELLAS on speed and ramped up sex but it's just so brilliantly and wickedly funny that you can't help but laugh at all the craziness going on. Yes, there are some moral police out there who are going to object to a movie being made about a man who ripped off poor people but I'm sorry, I like the fact that this film doesn't really care about those people and instead just gives us an in-your-face look at these wild people, their wild drugs and their wild sex lives. This film is certainly over-the-top in regards to the excess but so were the characters so I thought they just went hand and hand with each other. Scorsese was the perfect person for this project because of his ramped up speed but here is goes all out and really delivers an incredibly wicked little ride that will have you smiling and laughing at some very questionable things.I've been a fan of DiCaprio long before he became famous and this here is without question the greatest performance he's given so far. I was curious to see how he would do playing someone crazy and wild like this but he does so perfectly and I'd say it was a flawless performance. No matter what was going on in this crazy life you believe that you're watching a real character and as his character says throughout the film, sell him something. Well, DiCaprio sells this performance and role like no one else could. The supporting players are just as wonderful with Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Matthew McConaughey and Jean Dujardin all delivering terrific performances. The cinematography, the music selections and everything else are just flawless here. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET could have been a complete disaster in so many ways but the strong screenplay and Scorsese's wicked direction makes it an incredibly entertaining film that works so well. It's hard to fully put into words what Scorsese and DiCaprio have pulled off but it's certainly one of the best and most memorable comedies in ages.",scorsese dicaprio make another masterpiece,wolf wall street 2013 out 4 two word review masterpice martin scorseses latest film is yet another brilliant one with leonard dicaprio turning greatest performance his career as stockbroker jordan belfort who takes some rather bland people turn them into one biggest scams that fbi ever saw wolf wall street is going make many people unhappy there are many more who are probably going be offended by it but perfection that is scorsese was right when he decided turn this into comedy instead drama yeah its goodfellas speed ramped up sex but its just so brilliantly wickedly funny that you cant help but laugh at all craziness going yes there are some moral police out there who are going object movie being made about man who ripped off poor people but im sorry i like fact that this film doesnt really care about those people instead just gives us your face look at these wild people their wild drugs their wild sex lives this film is certainly over top regards excess but so were characters so i thought they just went hand hand with each other scorsese was perfect person this project because his ramped up speed but here is goes all out really delivers incredibly wicked little ride that will have you smiling laughing at some very questionable things ive been fan dicaprio long before he became famous this here is without question greatest performance hes given so far i was curious see how he would do playing someone crazy wild like this but he does so perfectly id say it was flawless performance no matter what was going this crazy life you believe that youre watching real character as his character says throughout film sell him something well dicaprio sells this performance role like no one else could supporting players are just as wonderful with jonah hill margot robbie rob reiner jon favreau matthew mcconaughey jean dujardin all delivering terrific performances cinematography music selections everything else are just flawless here wolf wall street could have been complete disaster so many ways but strong screenplay scorseses wicked direction makes it incredibly entertaining film that works so well its hard fully put into words what scorsese dicaprio have pulled off but its certainly one best most memorable comedies ages,0.675723622782446,0.2858193277310924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"

9.0,Wolf of Wall Street review,"If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar, it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen, and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events, but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill, who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs, and they're all used really well for their intended effect.The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes, but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the super-rich, crime still doesn't pay.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",wolf wall street review,if youve seen goodfellas or casino then youll know story wolf wall street this is another tale criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into debauched world dirty money out control substance abuse endless lies troubled family life downward spiral corruption that inevitably leads his own undoing only thing is this is less about gangsters mafia more about white collar crime guys wear suits work proper offices everything they do is just business funnily enough this whole movie still plays out like kind gangster film based memoirs jordan belfort real life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks average joes film showcases one seriously messed up slimeball man if his scheme sounds familiar its because its been inspiration behind 2000 film boiler room this film covers much same concepts albeit with better structure film maintains close intimate focus man as he rises power suckers thousands into his schemes then lives life extreme excess it is extreme whole film becomes laden with drugs sex superficial luxuries material things characters who want nothing more than take consume everything sheer corruption becomes palpable screen i couldnt help but shake my head at numerous scenes when i saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone their unrestrained partying debauchery i have no clue as how closely this film adapts real life events but at times its almost hard believe that things could have gone this far yet excesses serve underscore key themes criticisms american dream pursuit money success through any means remains main drive characters movie it leads fairly hard hitting downfall this film features good looking photography editing acting is great leonardo dicaprio is practically perfect as titular character rest cast pulls their weight really well including jonah hill who seems fit into his characters archetype very comfortably writing is really sharp good film is full great lines great speeches there are some great looking sets props costumes display this film music has varied mix songs theyre all used really well their intended effect wolf wall street is every bit as good as martin scorseses previous work with goodfellas casino all these films work with similar plots themes but twows is like gangster film masked by thin veil upper class corporate swindling it is film that candidly shows crimes excesses full before proving that even super rich crime still doesnt pay recommended 4 5 5 entertainment good story very good film perfect,0.5722946859903381,0.16637681159420287,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"

9.0,"Wolf in a $2,000 suit","An old adage goes that if on a certain day, everyone in the world received a million dollars, by the end of the day, ten percent of the people would have all the money.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" pretty much shows how that could happen.Based on Jordan Belfort's book, this is a very entertaining movie - although probably not for those who lost their money. The film follows Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from newbie stockbroker to head of Stratton Oakmont, the largest 'Over The Counter' stockbroking firm in the US.Along the way he has two marriages, acquires luxury homes and automobiles, a sea going yacht with a helicopter, a taste for wild office sex parties, which would put a Roman orgy to shame, and a huge drug habit. But even after the FBI steps in and everything unravels, the guy still can't help making money.The movie is loud, lewd and often hilarious; it doesn't have a boring minute.Matthew McConaughey gives a brief but telling performance as Mark Hanna who initiates Belfort into the darker side of Wall Street. He also introduces the tribal chest-thumping chant that becomes a motif throughout the film.Aussie Margot Robbie is hard to take your eyes off as Belfort's second wife, Naomi. She was also an amusing guest on talk shows when the movie was released where she told how she pulled off the Brooklyn accent, and kept the news about her nude scenes from her family for as long as possible.But this is Leonardo's movie. Although in his portrayal of Belfort, where there appears to be almost no moral or ethical boundaries, he keeps our sympathy because he can actually laugh at himself; it's a high energy performance, but with a light touch.In a way, the performance has echoes of the one he gave for Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"". Despite the fact that both Jordan Belfort and Frank Abagnale Jr. break the law, their sheer audacity dazzles us. Also, both Spielberg and Scorsese have great comedic timing; they know how to deliver a punch line. If you were looking for a reason why this film works better than Scorsese's ""The Aviator"", which also starred Leonardo, it could simply be the latter film's lack of humour - Hughes was eccentric but he wasn't funny.Enjoyable as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is, at the end you can't help wondering if even half of it is true, how it is that with people like Belfort and his friends helping themselves to such over-sized slices of the pie, that the world's economy hasn't descended to the level it did in 1929.

8.0,A Three-Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...) Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in ""Superbad"" to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, ""Moneyball"" seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the film's five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing.",three hour bacchanalia caught film,based true story jordan belfort leonardo dicaprio his rise wealthy stockbroker living high life his fall involving crime corruption federal government as now february 2014 this film sits at impressive imdbs list greatest films all time using that as jumping off point this review we will have scale it back bit whether film should be list is debatable but certainly not within top 100 it is neither that good nor among director martin scorseses best work along same lines oscar nomination best picture is bit much while there is no denying it was probably among ten best films 2013 with some incredible acting more than adequate cinematography editing very fact it has no chance winning makes one question why even nominate film at all course without nine nominees we would be back having reasonable number five scorsese received best director nomination this strikes me as more understandable he managed assemble impressive cast tell story that is both compelling entertaining without trying put some moral tag it whether or not viewer thinks this is glorification or denouncement acts depicted is up them as film itself is blank best way while subject could drug use sexuality have been toned down absolutely there is good argument that they should have been especially non stop sex which comes across as gratuitous only adds more minutes this lengthy financial epic another argument says events are extremely unlikely exaggerated at times this is probably also true but film is accurate memoir not reality this is belfort telling his story with all embellishments that come with it if you want just facts read court transcripts leonardo dicaprio is nominated best actor this is choice that is understandable yet hard rally behind he truly becomes belfort probably makes man out be even more wild than he was that deserves nomination but this is not dicaprios best role he has also done fine job portraying howard hughes j edgar hoover not one he deserves win jonah hill other hand was amazing deserves win his supporting actor category being up again jared leto he probably has no chance but hill has come long way few short years lovable doofus superbad formidable actor his own right at first moneyball seemed be anomaly hils career but he showed world he could do even better when he became donny azoff this picture incredible whether terence winter deserves best adapted screenplay this film is unclear without having read book such nomination seems fair though win is hard say without more familiarity i am surprised no nominations came cinematography or editing which are strong their subtlety but oh well films five nominations it may walk away with one win winter or two at most dicaprio more likely it will walk away empty handed film is not flawless we could go about how awkward soundtrack was may or may not go be memorable much more than its nudity pervasive cursing,0.5309562057754826,0.3245945687511953,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.37}"
5.0,over hyped movie!,"Martin Scorsese is losing his gift as a director. The Wolf of Wall Street is another rendition of Scorsese's other movies. The narration, actions, and flow of Wolf of Wall Street is similar to Goodfellas, Casino and Mean Streets. Di Capiro's lead character is just another version of the Henry Hill character from the movie Goodfellas. Through the streetwise narration of Di Capiro one learns how the system is scammed, and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs, and prostitutes. The characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew of low lives. Scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with nudity, massive drug use, over the top sex, which can not compensate for the lack of story depth. 3 hours was way too long for a half hour story. Five stars out of ten.",over hyped movie,martin scorsese is losing his gift as director wolf wall street is another rendition scorseses other movies narration actions flow wolf wall street is similar goodfellas casino mean streets di capiros lead character is just another version henry hill character movie goodfellas through streetwise narration di capiro one learns how system is scammed experiences dysfunctional behaviour drugs prostitutes characters lack morals creates usual drama stew low lives scorsese tries spice up old recycled formula with nudity massive drug use over top sex which can not compensate lack story depth 3 hours was way too long half hour story five stars out ten,0.3899305555555556,-0.033680555555555554,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.5}"
,Where Human Flaws Make a Rotten Core,"Brilliantly acted, superbly written and as one would expect from a picture by Martin Scorsese, it is a masterclass of directorial craft.Showy when it needs to be, but also quiet and contemplative. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the equivalent of something like ""Good Fellas"" or even more so ""Casino"" but set in the world of finance. The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"".Where Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.Leonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.It's a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.One could almost hear Scorsese's clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.It is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference.

,A very well made movie of a terrible group of stock traders.,"There are many noteworthy days in the history of Wall Street and the stock market, and the one featured here is ""Black Monday"", October 19, 1987, when the market dropped about 1/3rd. Jordan Belfort was a young man of about 25, had just started a new job on Wall Street, and this event put him out of work. It turned out to be the catalyst for the subject of this movie.Belfort found a job as a trader with a motley band of guys who focused on so-called ""penny stocks"", very small mostly unknown companies selling for generally less than one dollar per share, often for only a few cents. He was puzzled, why worry about these. Because, he learned, the commission was great, 50% of the sales total and getting a few investors to buy $5000 to $10,000 worth would generate a very handsome income. Plus the operation of such trading was scarcely regulated, if at all in the 1980s.So filled with the euphoria of big profits Belfort rented a garage and started his own trading company with his own motley crew and trained them well. But what they did was illegal, where a large number of traders each buy parcels of a penny stock to drive up the price, then dumping them. They get the profits from both hefty commission and artificially inflated stock prices, while the investors get taken. This and other irregularities resulted in Belfort being convicted and sent to prison, but his term was shortened by his cooperation with the FBI. So this movie is about those 6 or 7 years where he was expanding his trading operation making himself and his traders wealthy by playing very loose with the rules. And living immersed deeply in the drug and sex culture. It mostly comes across as a dark comedy.Belfort himself says the drugs and sex shown in the movie, including sex parties at work or on the yacht, and the pervasive foul language, are not exaggerated at all. Maybe so, but to me it was way overdone for what turns out to be a mainstream movie with an A-list director. I am all for accuracy but it would have been a much better movie if they had moderated the filth quite a bit. That part disappointed me, that Hollywood continues to get so raw and less entertaining. Leonardo DiCaprio is really good as Jordan Belfort, arguably his best performance so far, and to me he deserved the Oscar for best actor. Also superb is Jonah Hill as his foul buddy, Donnie Azoff. Margot Robbie is lovely as his second wife, Naomi. And also superb is the actual Oscar winner, in another movie, Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna, Belfort's early boss who explains to him what the trading business is really all about, they don't care about the clients, and whether they make money on investments. The traders get commission, their job is to keep the buying and selling going.Although this is based on a real person and his own story, many of the characters and events are fictional.",very well made movie terrible group stock traders,there are many noteworthy days history wall street stock market one featured here is black monday october 19 1987 when market dropped about 1 3rd jordan belfort was young man about 25 had just started new job wall street this event put him out work it turned out be catalyst subject this movie belfort found job as trader with motley band guys who focused so called penny stocks very small mostly unknown companies selling generally less than one dollar per share often only few cents he was puzzled why worry about these because he learned commission was great 50 sales total getting few investors buy 5000 10 000 worth would generate very handsome income plus operation such trading was scarcely regulated if at all 1980s so filled with euphoria big profits belfort rented garage started his own trading company with his own motley crew trained them well but what they did was illegal where large number traders each buy parcels penny stock drive up price then dumping them they get profits both hefty commission artificially inflated stock prices while investors get taken this other irregularities resulted belfort being convicted sent prison but his term was shortened by his cooperation with fbi so this movie is about those 6 or 7 years where he was expanding his trading operation making himself his traders wealthy by playing very loose with rules living immersed deeply drug sex culture it mostly comes across as dark comedy belfort himself says drugs sex shown movie including sex parties at work or yacht pervasive foul language are not exaggerated at all maybe so but me it was way overdone what turns out be mainstream movie with list director i am all accuracy but it would have been much better movie if they had moderated filth quite bit that part disappointed me that hollywood continues get so raw less entertaining leonardo dicaprio is really good as jordan belfort arguably his best performance so far me he deserved oscar best actor also superb is jonah hill as his foul buddy donnie azoff margot robbie is lovely as his second wife naomi also superb is actual oscar winner another movie matthew mcconaughey as mark hanna belforts early boss who explains him what trading business is really all about they dont care about clients whether they make money investments traders get commission their job is keep buying selling going although this is based real person his own story many characters events are fictional,0.5407210062664608,0.18005842642206274,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.49}"
8.0,Other people's money. High life of a stockbroker.,"Martin Scorcese magnificently directs this wild, funny and somewhat repugnant story based on Jordon Belfort's own tome. A bit long, but it is the most interesting and fast moving three hours you'll spend. An outstanding cast surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, a Long Island stockbroker that masterminded a massive securities fraud in the 1990s. This film depicts Belfort being a self-made man; albeit through partying hard, self over-medicating, no holds barred debauchery leading to his whirlwind approach leaving a mark on Wall Street. Belfort's charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other people's hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women, exotic drugs, lavish homes and cars, and the utmost luxury making for a lush life. A master at scamming so well, he is a loud flaunting target for the FBI. It gets hard snitching on your closest friends, But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.Leave the kids at home, because THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is forewarned a deservedly hard R, due to strong sexual content, blatant drug use, language, violence and very graphic nudity. A strong supporting cast featuring: Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jon Bernthal and Matthew McConaughey.",other peoples money high life stockbroker,martin scorcese magnificently directs this wild funny somewhat repugnant story based jordon belforts own tome bit long but it is most interesting fast moving three hours youll spend outstanding cast surrounding leonardo dicaprio as belfort long island stockbroker that masterminded massive securities fraud 1990s this film depicts belfort being self made man albeit through partying hard self over medicating no holds barred debauchery leading his whirlwind approach leaving mark wall street belforts charisma being able attract followers sharing his use other peoples hard earned money live life beautiful women exotic drugs lavish homes cars utmost luxury making lush life master at scamming so well he is loud flaunting target fbi it gets hard snitching your closest friends but belfort manages use chance garner smaller stint prison 36 months leave kids at home because wolf wall street is forewarned deservedly hard r due strong sexual content blatant drug use language violence very graphic nudity strong supporting cast featuring jonah hill margot robbie rob reiner kyle chandler jon bernthal matthew mcconaughey,0.6188020833333333,0.17098011363636362,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
