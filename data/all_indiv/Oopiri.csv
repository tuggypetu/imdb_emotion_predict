7,Smartly remade movie that adds more flavor!,"I have watched The Intouchables a long time ago and I loved that movie for its depiction of the relationship between the Wealthy man and his care taker. When I heard it was being remade, I initially thought that the movie won't make it good on screen. But after seeing the movie, my thought changed completely!Pros: Altered Script - the main theme of the movie stays the same. But the way the script has been adjusted to suit the South Indian Audience deserves a mention. Also, there was no considerable lag in the screenplay.Dialogs - Deserves the applause! Easily the backbone of the movie. The dialogs weren't melodramatic but was sentimental at some places and brought humor to the screen when required.Casting - Pretty much good. Karthi-Nagarjuna combo steals the show here!Cons: Ooops!! Sorry nothing to mention. I was just happily enjoying the movie and failed to notice tiny flaws. This is one of the most credibly remade movie ever in South Indian cinema. Watch it and enjoy the experience.",smartly remade movie that adds more flavor,i have watched intouchables long time ago i loved that movie its depiction relationship between wealthy man his care taker when i heard it was being remade i initially thought that movie wont make it good screen but after seeing movie my thought changed completely pros altered script main theme movie stays same but way script has been adjusted suit south indian audience deserves mention also there was no considerable lag screenplay dialogs deserves applause easily backbone movie dialogs werent melodramatic but was sentimental at some places brought humor screen when required casting pretty much good karthi nagarjuna combo steals show here cons ooops sorry nothing mention i was just happily enjoying movie failed notice tiny flaws this is one most credibly remade movie ever south indian cinema watch it enjoy experience,0.5811147186147185,0.21428571428571433,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9,"You can't even turn off your eyes. Wonderful, Hilarious & Touching.","Oopiri/Thozha: Having said that it is an Official adaption of a great French Movie ""The Intouchables"" which is truly inspired from Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his French-Algerian caregiver Abdel Sellou, director Vamsi Paidipally has taken utmost care in rewriting it in Indianised style so that it can sync with the audience here. I won't say the plot because those who watched the French or English version they would have known it and at-least it would be a surprise for those who didn't watch it. So let us maintain that.First of all it is first of its kind film for our South film industry. The Brother Bonding, BroCode, Bromance, BroComedy between Karthi & Nagarjuna are simply amazing. I truly wonder Nagarjuna has become too choosy in selecting scripts after his historical debacle Bhai, he even promised to audience he will never make such films and now with this movie he is sticking srongly to his word. People might think it is an easy role for Nagarjuna to just sit & act on a wheel chair, but it is really difficult to act like this with not even a bit of movement in his hands or legs. He has passionately acted in this film and he enjoyed acting in this role. Literally he gave meaning to this role. He is definitely a inspiration to Senior & younger generation heroes now. This film makes Karthi's straight debut in Tollywood, he did a splendid job and especially his comic timing is so funny at times. With this, his place will also be cemented here too. No doubt now he will be flooded with many offers here. Tammanah, Prakash raj, Jayasudha, Ali, Gabriella & Kalpana have got apt roles. Even tammanah's own dubbing is very good in the movie.Vamsi rediscovered himself by beautifully adapting the story. There is a entirely a contrast between this movie & his previous works. He has done a tremendous work for this film. Of course comparisons from everywhere starts because it is a adaption but he delivered his best effort. Dialogues by Abburi are heart touching. Each and every scene has class performance that makes you cry & laugh at a time. It is impossible to make a film like this,it is just PVP Cinema has handpicked all the technicians & cast properly and has done a commendable job. Music by Gopi Sunder is splendid & situational. The only odd in the movie is, length of the film and second half narration is bit slow.Great story, great star cast, great cameos(Surprise !!), great technicians & great crew has made Oopiri watchable. If you ask me to define Oopiri film, my answer goes likes this: ""Oopiri is celebration of life, celebration of companionship, celebration of friendship, celebration of love, celebration of emotions and the list goes on... "" I cannot say more, the film must be experienced.‪#‎ChiruReviews‬ ‪#‎Oopiri‬ ‪#‎Thozha‬ ‪#‎NagarjunaAkkineni‬ ‪#‎PhenomenalHattrick‬ ‪#‎Karthi‬ ‪#‎PVPCinema‬",you cant even turn off your eyes wonderful hilarious touching,oopiri thozha having said that it is official adaption great french movie intouchables which is truly inspired philippe pozzo di borgo his french algerian caregiver abdel sellou director vamsi paidipally has taken utmost care rewriting it indianised style so that it can sync with audience here i wont say plot because those who watched french or english version they would have known it at least it would be surprise those who didnt watch it so let us maintain that first all it is first its kind film our south film industry brother bonding brocode bromance brocomedy between karthi nagarjuna are simply amazing i truly wonder nagarjuna has become too choosy selecting scripts after his historical debacle bhai he even promised audience he will never make such films now with this movie he is sticking srongly his word people might think it is easy role nagarjuna just sit act wheel chair but it is really difficult act like this with not even bit movement his hands or legs he has passionately acted this film he enjoyed acting this role literally he gave meaning this role he is definitely inspiration senior younger generation heroes now this film makes karthis straight debut tollywood he did splendid job especially his comic timing is so funny at times with this his place will also be cemented here too no doubt now he will be flooded with many offers here tammanah prakash raj jayasudha ali gabriella kalpana have got apt roles even tammanahs own dubbing is very good movie vamsi rediscovered himself by beautifully adapting story there is entirely contrast between this movie his previous works he has done tremendous work this film course comparisons everywhere starts because it is adaption but he delivered his best effort dialogues by abburi are heart touching each every scene has class performance that makes you cry laugh at time it is impossible make film like this it is just pvp cinema has handpicked all technicians cast properly has done commendable job music by gopi sunder is splendid situational only odd movie is length film second half narration is bit slow great story great star cast great cameos surprise great technicians great crew has made oopiri watchable if you ask me define oopiri film my answer goes likes this oopiri is celebration life celebration companionship celebration friendship celebration love celebration emotions list goes i cannot say more film must be experienced chirureviews oopiri thozha nagarjunaakkineni phenomenalhattrick karthi pvpcinema,0.5643333333333335,0.3086666666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9,Really Beautiful indeed !,"Oopiri / Thozhaa Guzaarish, Beautiful (Malayalam) is nothing compared to this beautiful movie. Even though its the remake of the Intouchables, Vamsi Paidipally created this as much beautiful it could be. at the end Oopiri gives you tears with happiness and love. The story goes without lagging , full of emotions , love and happiness. Compared to Vamsi's Yevadu which was an action thriller. this is purely different with dramatic sentimental scenes, which is not on the lot of usual ones. Yet , beautiful than his second one Brindaavanam. Nagarjuna is evergreen, as a main char, he never fails to make an impact. Karthi takes away the claps with his usual acting style and dialogue presentation. Tamannah, Prakash Raj all were too good in this one. OST satisfies to be with the track of the story. One thing i liked in this movie , is at every second it makes us happy, there are no place where it gets bored or lag. Watch it ! otherwise you will miss one of the most beautiful flick in this year. 9 out of 10",really beautiful indeed,oopiri thozhaa guzaarish beautiful malayalam is nothing compared this beautiful movie even though its remake intouchables vamsi paidipally created this as much beautiful it could be at end oopiri gives you tears with happiness love story goes without lagging full emotions love happiness compared vamsis yevadu which was action thriller this is purely different with dramatic sentimental scenes which is not lot usual ones yet beautiful than his second one brindaavanam nagarjuna is evergreen as main char he never fails make impact karthi takes away claps with his usual acting style dialogue presentation tamannah prakash raj all were too good this one ost satisfies be with track story one thing i liked this movie is at every second it makes us happy there are no place where it gets bored or lag watch it otherwise you will miss one most beautiful flick this year 9 out 10,0.5734567901234568,0.3438271604938271,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.18}"
8,Feel good movie,"A nice feel good movie which engages the attention for most of the part. Well acted, tightly edited with good screen play, story and minimal masala (but high on Entertainment), this movie has lot going in its favor to make it worthwhile watch.Unlike many other films, the producers have credited the source as remake of a French movie, rather than lifting and passing it off as their creation. Karthi as the aimless parolee with a tough exterior covering a caring person is standout. He carries the weight of the movie and is a scene stealer. Giving him good company is Nagarjuna who is charming as the invalid bound to wheel chair. He has to use his face and eyes especially to express the emotions as per the role and greatly complements Karthi. Others in the cast like Tamannah etc give good support. The scenes in Paris and external locations are well shot and add a interesting dimension to the plot.

9,Thozha is a brilliant feel-good film,"Vamshi Paidipally's Thozha is a feel-good film. If you're stressed or even not in a good mood, this is strictly for you. It's great to see a film that has everything to attract all types of audiences. From fun-loving comedies to tear-dropping emotional scenes, Thozha has everything to make your day perfect. The film focuses on the main plot right from the beginning without any diversions. Vamshi's writing creates magic on screen especially in those brilliant emotional scenes that are not exaggerated at all. The characters are rightfully established without any delays and enters us into their fun and emotional journey. This visually pleasing drama works marvelously because of the exceptional performances of the lead actors. Our eyes are glued to both Karthi and Nagarjuna because they are an interesting combo on screen. Starting from Karthi, he has a role that fulfills his acting prowess perfectly. After Paruthiveeran, this is his complete role as an actor. He has an extraordinary sense of humor and an amazing careless attitude that connects us with his character. His emotional scenes are one of the pillars of strength in this feel-good drama. On the other side, we have the versatile Nagarjuna essays a really tough role. Sitting in a wheel-chair for the whole film is unimaginably a big challenge for an actor and Nagarjuna did it with justice. He plays the role effortlessly and he is a delight to watch on screen. We have Tamannaah, Prakash Raj, Vivek, and many more supporting actors who are helping the film to be more colorful. Gopi Sunder's musical score is another strength of the film. His songs are beautiful and his background score adds so much intensity to the scenes. Vamshi's filmmaking is the major factor that helps us get along with the film. His dialogues are significantly heart-touching and his screenplay doesn't bring down the pace at any time. Overall, Thozha is a brilliant feel-good film.",thozha is brilliant feel good film,vamshi paidipallys thozha is feel good film if youre stressed or even not good mood this is strictly you its great see film that has everything attract all types audiences fun loving comedies tear dropping emotional scenes thozha has everything make your day perfect film focuses main plot right beginning without any diversions vamshis writing creates magic screen especially those brilliant emotional scenes that are not exaggerated at all characters are rightfully established without any delays enters us into their fun emotional journey this visually pleasing drama works marvelously because exceptional performances lead actors our eyes are glued both karthi nagarjuna because they are interesting combo screen starting karthi he has role that fulfills his acting prowess perfectly after paruthiveeran this is his complete role as actor he has extraordinary sense humor amazing careless attitude that connects us with his character his emotional scenes are one pillars strength this feel good drama other side we have versatile nagarjuna essays really tough role sitting wheel chair whole film is unimaginably big challenge actor nagarjuna did it with justice he plays role effortlessly he is delight watch screen we have tamannaah prakash raj vivek many more supporting actors who are helping film be more colorful gopi sunders musical score is another strength film his songs are beautiful his background score adds so much intensity scenes vamshis filmmaking is major factor that helps us get along with film his dialogues are significantly heart touching his screenplay doesnt bring down pace at any time overall thozha is brilliant feel good film,0.5918253968253966,0.3324087301587301,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10,Beautiful feel good movie,"One of the best movies directed by Vamsi Padipalli. Though a remake, Oopiri has the ""Indian"" essence. The movie is filled with sentiment and cute comedy.

Initially, I thought that they could have cast a Telugu actor instead of Karthi - someone like a Allu Arjun, or a Nani. But, by the end w/o doubt, Karthi brings the much needed fresh authenticity to the character. With Nagarjuna, the Akkineni gene shows throughout the film.

1,What were they going for?,"After watching the original the intouchables, it's hard not to compare the movie with the original one.In the original movie, their main focus was the relationship between both main characters, in a way the entire movie evolved around them, and the movie was told form Driss perspective about Philippe's life. Philippe's heartbreak, laugh, rejuvenation, new profound view for life, through Driss. That was it.That's all that needed for the story. Coming to the remade version. They included too much nonsense into the movie. Every main character has a backstory. There was no need for that. They prolonged the movie for more than 2 hours, just for the sake of prolonging it. The unnecessary romance between seenu and Keerthi, and a little too much of Prasad character, totally made the movie a regular old ""telugu movie formula"" cliché. Maybe the movie would be fine for the fresh viewer, who haven't watched the original version. Maybe, that was they were going for, or, they lost the entire plot. Both the main characters, Nagarjuna and karthi, did there best, but, that wasn't enough for the plot at hand. There wasn't anything special from both Tamannaah and Prakash Raj. Well, all in all, if you haven't seen the original version(The Intouchables), i suggest you give that one a chance before watching the remake(Oopiri). In my personal view, The Intouchables did justice for both the movie, and to the real life story of an incredible friendship.
