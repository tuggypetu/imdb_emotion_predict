,A lesson in swallowing reality,"As an enormous Superman fan I picked this video up (for less than 5 dollars) just to add to my collection. I know it had nothing to do with the actual origins of the DC Comics Steel which came from the Death of Superman story but still has some similarities. The story revolves around John Henry Irons, played of course by Shaq, an army Lieutenant who worked on the creation of high tech sonic weapons along with Susan Sparks, played by Annabeth Gish, and Nathaniel Burk played by Judd Nelson. After a miscalculation leaves Susan paralyzed Irons leaves the army into civilian life. Nathaniel becomes the evil nemesis building the weapons and preparing to sell them to world arms dealers but first testing them on bank robberies with street gangs. Irons with the help of Susan referred to as Sparky and Iron's Uncle Joe played by Richard Roundtree build their own crime fighting weapons as well as a head to toe...well except for his face...outfit of steel. The acting does get rather bad, it feels like a grade school play, and the jokes get far too reality based as so many people have pointed out. The Shaft joke just isn't funny, and the basketball references are unnecessary but that's not what wrecks the movie. What wrecks the movie is the storyline. They could so easily have based this character after the Superman origin. They made reference to the man of steel so many times that it would not have taken much to create Iron's character following the death of Superman. Shaq is not a terrible actor, there are far worse, but his physical stature makes his regular joe schmoe character almost unbelievable.He towers above everyone and just looks silly. They never establish any sort of romance between Susan and John Irons although they hint to it, it never turns into anything. The story moves along at a good pace, and I thought Judd Nelson played a kick butt bad guy...although he played it almost sarcastically, it fit the movie really. The special effects were cheesy and obviously cheap but I can look past that. The part that bothers me the most is that his ""steel"" suit being bullet proof is fine but the good 5 or 6 inches on his face that was uncovered miraculously never got touched by bullets or anything else. Plot holes are almost expected in a film like this so you have to swallow your reality to enjoy it. But sometimes if the movie isn't good enough, it's not worth swallowing anything. I don't regret watching it, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen that's for sure. 5/10",lesson swallowing reality,as enormous superman fan i picked this video up less than 5 dollars just add my collection i know it had nothing do with actual origins dc comics steel which came death superman story but still has some similarities story revolves around john henry irons played course by shaq army lieutenant who worked creation high tech sonic weapons along with susan sparks played by annabeth gish nathaniel burk played by judd nelson after miscalculation leaves susan paralyzed irons leaves army into civilian life nathaniel becomes evil nemesis building weapons preparing sell them world arms dealers but first testing them bank robberies with street gangs irons with help susan referred as sparky irons uncle joe played by richard roundtree build their own crime fighting weapons as well as head toe well except his face outfit steel acting does get rather bad it feels like grade school play jokes get far too reality based as so many people have pointed out shaft joke just isnt funny basketball references are unnecessary but thats not what wrecks movie what wrecks movie is storyline they could so easily have based this character after superman origin they made reference man steel so many times that it would not have taken much create irons character following death superman shaq is not terrible actor there are far worse but his physical stature makes his regular joe schmoe character almost unbelievable he towers above everyone just looks silly they never establish any sort romance between susan john irons although they hint it it never turns into anything story moves along at good pace i thought judd nelson played kick butt bad guy although he played it almost sarcastically it fit movie really special effects were cheesy obviously cheap but i can look past that part that bothers me most is that his steel suit being bullet proof is fine but good 5 or 6 inches his face that was uncovered miraculously never got touched by bullets or anything else plot holes are almost expected film like this so you have swallow your reality enjoy it but sometimes if movie isnt good enough its not worth swallowing anything i dont regret watching it its not worst movie ive ever seen thats sure 5 10,0.5764705796848654,0.09643990929705216,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.44}"
5.0,"""Well, I'll be dipped in s*** and rolled in breadcrumbs""","Steel is one of those films where you constantly have to keep telling yourself ""this is NOT a TV movie"". A cheap, outrageously bad superhero vehicle for the acting... er... talents?... of 7'1 basketball player Shaquille O'Neal.Commendably, the film does actually have three clear acts, and Steel's emergence, though underplayed, doesn't happen for over forty minutes. In-jokes are a-plenty, as it mentions Batman, Superman, Jerry Maguire (""show me the money!"") and three instances of John Irons (O'Neal) having to net basketballs. The final time sees a life-threatening toss of a grenade. A lousy basketball player throughout, Shaq gets to quip ""I never make these"". Or would you prefer Richard Roundtree as Uncle Joe, who designs Steel's hammer for him? ""I did the metalwork,"" he explains, ""I especially like the shaft."" Cue lots of double-takes and knowing glances, with Roundtree looking round, hands in the air, proclaiming ""what?""The special effects are reasonable for tv movie land, but, as this is (pinch me, I must be imagining it) a real cinema movie, they're quite cheap. Steel is badly written, contains atrocious dialogue, is poorly acted, shabbily directed and with an overbearing, repetitive musical score.

5.0,so bad it's good,"This is a B-movie classic. The special effects are awful and the acting is worse, but at least it's not boring. As a cinematic experience, it's below par, but as entertainment it's top notch. It's basically like a B-movie, unintentionally hysterical version of Superman (which makes sense, since apparently Steel is based on a DC comic series which was an offshoot of the Superman Funeral for a friend storyline) , except Steel's only discernible superpowers are: being tall, having a metal suit that makes him walk slowly, and uttering unfunny catch phrases that are so bad you have to bust out laughing. This movie is probably the funniest thing I've seen all year. Of course, it's not intended to be funny most of the time when it is.Watching Shaq ""act"" is the highlight of the film. I fell out of my chair laughing every time he said something. Shaq's still a better actor than Hulk Hogan though, not that that's saying much. They should give Shaq more movies. Hulk Hogan made a dozen or more, and they were all awful, why not Shaq?The special effects look like they were made in the 1980s. Bad miniatures and Superman-esque laser effects look pretty silly in this day and age. This adds to the fun factor of the movie though since you'll probably scream ""Dear Lord that laser is the same miniature they used in Godzilla in the 60s!"".The plot to the movie isn't horrible, even though it's pretty thin. Basically Steel is a superhero with a secret identity out to save the world from an evil supervillain. Pretty standard superhero fare.This movie has earned its place in my heart alongside other bad movie classics like ""cool as ice"" starring vanilla ice. A must-see for bad movie buffs. Some folks who like superhero films might like it too since it's mildly diverting and quick-paced. Those who relish quality cinematic experiences should avoid.",so bad its good,this is b movie classic special effects are awful acting is worse but at least its not boring as cinematic experience its below par but as entertainment its top notch its basically like b movie unintentionally hysterical version superman which makes sense since apparently steel is based dc comic series which was offshoot superman funeral friend storyline except steels only discernible superpowers are being tall having metal suit that makes him walk slowly uttering unfunny catch phrases that are so bad you have bust out laughing this movie is probably funniest thing ive seen all year course its not intended be funny most time when it is watching shaq act is highlight film i fell out my chair laughing every time he said something shaqs still better actor than hulk hogan though not that thats saying much they should give shaq more movies hulk hogan made dozen or more they were all awful why not shaq special effects look like they were made 1980s bad miniatures superman esque laser effects look pretty silly this day age this adds fun factor movie though since youll probably scream dear lord that laser is same miniature they used godzilla 60s plot movie isnt horrible even though its pretty thin basically steel is superhero with secret identity out save world evil supervillain pretty standard superhero fare this movie has earned its place my heart alongside other bad movie classics like cool as ice starring vanilla ice must see bad movie buffs some folks who like superhero films might like it too since its mildly diverting quick paced those who relish quality cinematic experiences should avoid,0.5992694805194805,-0.08016774891774889,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.18}"
3.0,Stinks,"Garbage superhero movie based on the Superman spin-off character, Steel. One of the all-time bad comic book movies. Shaquille O'Neal is terrible, delivering lines like he's reading a menu. The armor his character wears is ludicrous and cheap. His sidekick is a woman in a wheelchair named Sparky, played by Annabeth Gish. Poor Annabeth tries but the material she's given is dreadful. Judd Nelson gives a self-consciously bad performance as the villain Burke. He knows he's in trash and doesn't even try to make the material work. In many scenes he's clearly suppressing laughter at the terrible lines he's given. It may not be professional behavior but I can hardly blame the guy. Collect that paycheck, Bender. Despite taking place in 1997, the police are driving cars that look like they're from the early '80s. Just another sign of the shoddy production, I guess. The whole thing looks cheap like it was produced by the dollar store. I suppose there is some unintended comic value of the ""so bad it's good"" variety. But mostly it just stinks.",stinks,garbage superhero movie based superman spin off character steel one all time bad comic book movies shaquille oneal is terrible delivering lines like hes reading menu armor his character wears is ludicrous cheap his sidekick is woman wheelchair named sparky played by annabeth gish poor annabeth tries but material shes given is dreadful judd nelson gives self consciously bad performance as villain burke he knows hes trash doesnt even try make material work many scenes hes clearly suppressing laughter at terrible lines hes given it may not be professional behavior but i can hardly blame guy collect that paycheck bender despite taking place 1997 police are driving cars that look like theyre early 80s just another sign shoddy production i guess whole thing looks cheap like it was produced by dollar store i suppose there is some unintended comic value so bad its good variety but mostly it just stinks,0.575,-0.16920289855072465,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.53}"
7.0,This movie doesn't deserve to be in the Bottom 100 at all,"STEEL is for almost everyone a dreadful movie. On IMDB it has a score of 2,8 and few months ago, when it reached 10,000 ratings, it ended in the Bottom 100 (the list of the 100 lowest rated major releases according to users' ratings). Unfortunately, I am not the typical viewer, since when I saw it when it was 32 ratings shy I gave it a try, but I didn't ended up hating the movie. In reverse, I ended up enjoying it very much and I personally couldn't believe all the hate that surrounded this movie for years.The movie begins with John Henry Irons (Shaquille O'Neal) that is in the Army and he is trying a super-powerful cannon. A fellow serviceman, Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson) set the cannon at the maximum power and there is a horrible accident that destroys a entire building and cripples Irons' friend Sparky (Annabeth Gish). Nathaniel is of course expelled from the Army and Irons returns home to his grandma.Later there is a street gang that robs a bank using the weapons with Burke and Irons' technology. Irons realizes that Burke is dealing with all the weapons smugglers and dealers for letting people using his dangerous weapons everywhere. So it's up to Irons, Sparky and Uncle Joe (Richard Roundtree) to stop Burke. And so Irons creates a steel (for some looks like made of rubber) suit and a huge hammer/weapon and goes out at night to fight crime and, as everyone would expect, he succedds in defeating Burke.So why I didn't hated the movie? Well, the plot in my opinion gives a message like ''don't never give up in defeating your enemy, because the day of revenge will come sooner or later''. And I found the soundtrack pretty cool since it gives a nice and nostalgic 90s feel. Despite Shaquille O'Neal is a bit one-note in his performance (and he was even nominated for a Razzie for Worst Actor the following year) and he looks like the largest sardine can ever made with that steel suit, I have to admit it, he was much better than in KAZAAM (his other leading man movie). About the only thing I would agree with most of the reviewers is that the special effects look a bit dated even for 1997 standards, but at the end, for me it wasn't a problem. If this movie would have been made with the same budget of movies like THE AVENGERS or IRON MAN then I would have hated it, but since the budget wasn't that huge the movie was adequate.Don't be afraid to buck conventional wisdom, because I think that there are some that might enjoy this movie just like I did, and trust me, there are much WORSE movies out there!",this movie doesnt deserve be bottom 100 at all,steel is almost everyone dreadful movie imdb it has score 2 8 few months ago when it reached 10 000 ratings it ended bottom 100 list 100 lowest rated major releases according users ratings unfortunately i am not typical viewer since when i saw it when it was 32 ratings shy i gave it try but i didnt ended up hating movie reverse i ended up enjoying it very much i personally couldnt believe all hate that surrounded this movie years movie begins with john henry irons shaquille oneal that is army he is trying super powerful cannon fellow serviceman nathaniel burke judd nelson set cannon at maximum power there is horrible accident that destroys entire building cripples irons friend sparky annabeth gish nathaniel is course expelled army irons returns home his grandma later there is street gang that robs bank using weapons with burke irons technology irons realizes that burke is dealing with all weapons smugglers dealers letting people using his dangerous weapons everywhere so its up irons sparky uncle joe richard roundtree stop burke so irons creates steel some looks like made rubber suit huge hammer weapon goes out at night fight crime as everyone would expect he succedds defeating burke so why i didnt hated movie well plot my opinion gives message like dont never give up defeating your enemy because day revenge will come sooner or later i found soundtrack pretty cool since it gives nice nostalgic 90s feel despite shaquille oneal is bit one note his performance he was even nominated razzie worst actor following year he looks like largest sardine can ever made with that steel suit i have admit it he was much better than kazaam his other leading man movie about only thing i would agree with most reviewers is that special effects look bit dated even 1997 standards but at end me it wasnt problem if this movie would have been made with same budget movies like avengers or iron man then i would have hated it but since budget wasnt that huge movie was adequate dont be afraid buck conventional wisdom because i think that there are some that might enjoy this movie just like i did trust me there are much worse movies out there,0.6195436507936507,-0.09161706349206349,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.4}"

6.0,Jumbo-Sized Hero,"Let's get the worst facets of STEEL out of the way first. Yes, Shaquille O'Neal is a dreadful actor. Yes, he looks like the world's biggest sardine can in his Steel armor. Yes, the dialog is bargain basement. Yes, Judd Nelson makes for the worst comic book villain this side of Mark Hamill as The Trickster in THE FLASH television series. And yes, the film embarrasses itself even further by clumsily trying to deliver a we-must-stop-using-weapons-to-settle-our-differences message. Happy?STEEL is not a masterpiece in any sense of the word, but that doesn't mean it should be completely written off. It's one of those pictures that requires you to set aside your pre-conceived notions about good film-making and just enjoy the ride. Do that, and STEEL is a surprisingly amusing little adventure. O'Neal is fun, if not unspectacular, as our jumbo-sized hero, a do-gooder vigilante cleanin' up the streets with a big ol' hammer and souped-up motorbike. He's aided by wheelchair-bound hottie Annabeth Gish and an aged Richard Roundtree as his off-the-wall Uncle Joe.Our hero's climactic showdown with the one-dimensionally evil Nelson is incredibly cheesy, as are many scenes, but the film has its heart so firmly in the right place you'll be more than a little lenient. As usual, what Shaq lacks in talent he makes up for in charm and a deep likability that seeps right through the screen.STEEL is an uncomplicated film that seems custom-made for little boys, who will absolutely adore it.

This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire lifetime, and I've seen quite a few.It's yet another comic-book-adaptation based on a series that was unpopular to begin with. Shaq does his Attack as Steel, a superhero who runs around very slow in a heavy metal suit.Whereas Spidey and Batman, et al, all have their special powers, Steel really just has a bulletproof metal suit - the ""wire shooter"" is a rip-off of the device used by Michael Keaton in ""Batman."" It attaches itself to a building and up, up and away he goes! However, the device moves at an astonishingly slow pace.

4.0,"It's good for a rainy day, I'd say...","With all this madness about superheroes going on right now (""The Avengers"" just opened today), I decided to go back in time to 1997, to the poorly received box office flop ""Steel."" I was 12 back in 1997, but I have to admit that I liked ""Steel"" then (I also liked the big-budget adaptation of another favorite superhero of mine, ""Spawn"").15 years later, a lot has changed. For one, I've grown up. I now realize that ""Steel"" is not a very good movie. I remember around that time, my cousin saw ""Steel"" in the theaters and told us that it was not a very good movie. The critics and most sensible audience members seemed to agree.But I digress; ""Steel"" is good for one thing and one thing only: a rainy day, like today. Since I'm not daring brave the over-crowded theaters for fear of being over-run by Avengers fan-boys (and fan-girls), I decided to pop in my 14-year-old VHS copy of ""Steel"" and relive 1997 like it was just 15 years ago (which, in fact, it was).""Steel"" is the live-action adaptation of the second-tier DC Comics character co-created by Louise Simonson and Jon Bogdanove, with NBA star Shaquille O'Neal playing the titular steel-armored, non-super-powered superhero whose real name is John Henry Irons in his civilian identity.I'm not really a fan of the movie anymore (most readers will remember that I'm largely a Marvel Comics reader), but I find the history of the original comic book character to be quite fascinating: as yet another proud, positive black-American superhero in comics, John Henry Irons is a brilliant former weapons designer for a private arms-manufacturing company whose life is saved, both literally and metaphorically, by the mighty Man of Steel himself, Superman. Ironically, a later incident with the powerful super-villain Doomsday costs Superman his life, and Irons's life is changed forever when he decides to don a powered suit of armor of his own making - much like Marvel Comics' Tony Stark/Iron Man - and fight crime himself as Steel (with Superman's logo blazoned mightily on his chest as a reminder of his inspiration) and wielding a powerful sledgehammer, too.The 1997 live-action adaptation removes any mention of Superman (or his apparent death), except for a tattoo O'Neal has on his arm, and goes forward with its own origin story. Certain aspects of the movie are faithful to the comics, but the rest of it is pretty campy and just bloody awful. This time out, Irons is a weapons designer for the U.S. Army and when an ambitious rival, Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson), is involved in an accident that kills a U.S. senator and leaves his best friend Susan ""Sparky"" Sparks (Annabeth Gish) a paraplegic, Irons resigns from the military in disgust.Irons (whose name is reportedly inspired by the legendary black-American folk hero John Henry) returns to his home in Los Angeles, only to discover that street gangs are out committing brazen bank robberies using the exact same, albeit heavily modified, weapons he designed. With Sparky and Uncle Joe (Richard Roundtree) by his side, Irons dons a custom-made suit of armor as the armored superhero Steel. As he dives deeper into his investigation, he discovers that his old rival Nathaniel Burke (who has since recruited young neighborhood street kids to do his bidding) is behind the robberies and the deadly new weapons out on the street.""Steel"" is pretty cheesy and campy, and I don't mean that in a good way.Unlike most people, I don't think Shaquille O'Neal is that lousy an actor. I think that if he were given the right material, he would manage out OK. At least here, I think he seems perfect for the part of John Henry Irons/Steel; it's just a shame that the rest of the movie, as written and directed by Kenneth Johnson (""V""), is just not very good. In other words, Shaq just needed a better movie. The special effects, the hokey street dialogue, and the performances don't help matters much either. Richard Roundtree and Irma P. Hall do what they can, but aren't given a whole lot to do beyond offering elder-generation advice to the younger folks. Judd Nelson relishes his role as a stereotypical villain, but it's really Annabeth Gish as the physically handicapped yet resilient gadgeteer Susan Sparks who really seems to shine the most in what could have been a very limiting part.I sense that a remake/reboot is, or soon probably will be, in the works sometime in the near future, and that is one ""Steel"" I just ""may"" (italicized) fork over $7.50 at my local movie theater to see.

I tried to find something, anything, to like about this film, but it's simply dreadful.Why do they insist on putting Shaqille O'Neale in movies? However imposing and charismatic he may be in person, and no matter how entertaining he can be in various short TV commercials, he's a dullard and a lug on film. He's got no range, no gravitas, and he's so odd looking in the context of a 'normal' film world that he is actually rather repellent.I know, I know - Shaq is a celebrity, and celebrity sells.Some of the problem is that the director and screenwriter paid millions of dollars to cast a 7 foot 2 inch man in the role of an armored, high tech superhero, and then they threw the premise away on story elements and fight scenes that utterly waste the idea's potential.The DC superhero ""Steel"" was incredibly powerful, and resourceful: he could fly via boot jets, he fired big steel spikes from wrist launchers, he could pick up and throw railroad box cars, his armor could withstand mortar bursts and artillery fire, and his 'homing' hammer was the neatest visual gimmick since Captain America's shield.And he had a deeply resonant spiritual side as well - he was a man who was brought back from death itself by Superman and destiny, who took up his armor to fight the good fight in a world that needed heroes more than ever.Instead of all this great potential appearing on the screen, we get a big doofus with a bulletproof suit who runs around on foot and uses his hammer like a gun.If I wanted to really frustrate myself, I would imagine the black actor who played the Commander of Deep Space Nine (Avery Brooks) being cast in the role of Steel, and the millions of dollars that went into Shaq's salary being spend on cool SFX and CGI, so that Steel could fight sprawling high tech battles with the bad guys from under the sea to the edge of space, with building, bridges and tanks being flattened like tin foil and and attack helicopters getting knocked out of the sky by the hammer. And I would give Avery Brooks, who can ACT with a dignity and potential worthy of James Earl Jones, room to do well all the things that Shag does so badly: act, emote, express rage and anger and indignation at the perfidy of the bad guys, and make you feel too his strife and extremity and pride.Well, ""Steel"" killed the franchise, and so we will never know what could have been.Shaq, go back to playing basketball (and making amusing commercials); you do that supremely well. Please stop inflicting movies on us.1 star added because the idea of a high tech, armored black superhero who came back from the dead to be a hero was such a great idea.

6.0,Why the hate?!? It's fun! 6.4 all the way.,"John Henry Irons works in military science and weapon manufacturing. After a weapons testing goes wrong, he and his friend return to his home to start a new life. However, not long after they get home, they begin seeing reports of weapons they helped design used in robberies and gang wars in LA. It seems the fellow military scientist they worked with has set out to make his fortune selling military grade weaponry. So Irons takes it upon himself to fight a little fire with fire.This is by no means a great movie,, and it does not stack up when compared to the MCU, DCEU,, or the other superhero movies that came out before them. However,, it's a lot of fun! While Shaq will definitely not be winning any awards for his acting abilities (though I think his done fairly well with his comedy roles) he's not bad in this, not bad at all. The movie is very entertaining imo. I luv how they poked fun at the fact that Shaq can't make free throws (not that I can either).

9.0,Its NOT the comic book.,"How could it be the comic when much of Steel's early comic life was tied to Superman. Steel was one of the four possible Supermen who appeared right after Superman was killed by Doomsday in the comic book. There is no Superman, no Doomsday, almost nothing from the DC universe in the film, except the character itself.This is not a bad thing especially since the Steel comic could have been created with out having come from Superman. The plot line of where and how Steel comes to be is a close approximation of what a Superman-less origin might have been.I don't think its a movie that wants to be any more than it is which is a fun little romp in a super hero sort of way. Shaq is fine as Steel which he plays to the best of his ability. Allowing that the character never had much depth the central performance is everything it should be. The rest of the cast is a great deal of fun as they chew scenery and try not to take anything too seriously.So sue me I like this movie. Its a fun rainy day popcorn movie of the highest order.

,Poor action stuff that will only appeal to children and undemanding adults,"John Henry Irons is a weapons designer for the military who has been key in the development of a range of experimental weapons that immobilise enemy troops without any fatalities. However when Nat Burke tries to increase the power of the weapon during the test, the result sees a Senator dead and one of his colleagues disabled. The court martial sees Burke kicked out of the military and John decides his days of weapon design are over  returning to LA to work in a small steel mill. However when his weapons somehow make it into the hands of LA's criminal underworld, John decides that it is ""on"" and takes steps to counter the threat.Universally derided ever since it was even green lit for production, this film does have little to recommend it but still produces very basic distraction if that is what you want. The plot is obvious and goes just where you expect it to and it offers little for the discerning adult viewer (or to be honest the undemanding ones too). The action will please children but it is the wider delivery where it all falls down and, contrary to opinion, it is not all Shaq's fault. The script is clunky for the most part and has lots of injokes, most of which are embarrassing basketball references although, that said, the ""Shaft"" joke drew a laugh from me simply because it was so unexpected and so disrespectful to the film! This is very basic stuff though and nobody seems that interested in trying to make it more than that.Johnson is happy to deliver a kiddie-friendly superhero movie for the most part and this is all it seems to be. The cast have potential but too few of them have any decent material to work with. O'Neal can't act and that's the truth. He can play basketball and, given the riches this has given him we should not feel too sorry for him here. He says his lines and he stands where they tell him to stand but that is not the same as producing a character and being engaging  neither of which applies in this situation. Gish has little to do and Roundtree seems happy just to be a walking reference. Nelson hams it up in an obvious baddie while Harper, Hall and Ray J (!) are not the ones to address the lack of quality. The only person that I actually noted with interest was Kevin Grevioux, not because of his performance here but more because he is an interesting man who has built a small but varied career.Overall then this is a poor superhero movie but one that has had just about enough money spent on it to make it distract children and undemanding adults.

10.0,"For 97 it's pretty good, unless you have anything else to watch.","I have no interest in basketball, I stink at it, and the only big names I know are Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and the Harlem Globetrotters. I have no idea why everyone likes to criticize Shaq, nor do I really care - he had to be good at something in order to be ridiculed so much.Quoting others, for 1997 it's pretty good, unless you have anything else to watch. It's not a masterpiece, but rather one of those pictures that requires you to set aside your pre-conceived notions about good film-making and just enjoy the ride. Do that, and Steel is a surprisingly amusing little adventure comedy. On top of all that, it has a memorable theme and subtle special effects.John Henry Irons was a harmless weapons designer until his project crippled his partner Sparks. After quitting his job, his weapons are mass-produced for criminals, and in order to stop it Irons and Sparks create a suit of armor that leads Irons to become the superhero vigilante Steel. He is the blue collar Iron Man of the DC universe. Overall, it's an average superhero film plot.The original story of Steel was based on the comic book Death of Superman. Irons wanted to go after Doomsday, the killer of Superman, himself, thus creating a mechanical super suit. But the film was in development for so long, that it lost all meaning. Instead, we got a cheesier independent film without the long drama. Given the way others cashed on the Death of Superman, the film could have been far worse.The reason why its one of my favorite movies is Steels realistic, cheap and simple armor. The hand-forged work-in-progress suit with chain mail and occasional glitches was made in a junkyard out of regular iron and steel. That's as good as any of us can get without using advanced industrial facilities. Some may argue it looks like someone decided to pour glue all over their body and go rolling around in a junkyard, but it's well thought through, even though parts sometimes just fall off in action.The 34kg armored suit is not only bulletproof, but also well padded, able to absorb most kinetic energy. Steel takes on a clip of ammo, some stun impulses, and a sonic blast that throws him back about 6m. He even falls of a building about 24m into a dumpster. It's virtually impregnable to known weaponry. I really like how they made the waist area. It's simultaneously flexible and incredibly strong. There is no such tech on the market even a decade later. The chain mail is almost indistinguishable from plate armor creating an impression that he is almost completely covered in steel plates.The electric support is a basic video/audio 31km earpiece transceiver, with an extra camera for rear view, an inbuilt GPS for fast navigation around the city, and a basic body monitoring system with body ventilation. The left arm houses a nail gun and a grappling hook (slow, but supports about 181kg for a short time).The shoulders are nice, but don't protect from above dangers, exposing the chain mail, and gloves are just regular surface chain mail, with no palm protection.The weakest part of the suit is the helmet. Not only does look like it's made of rubber, but it also leaves the face exposed. Steel was shot in the head several times throughout the film, but the biggest injury he sustained was a scratched chin from falling on pavement. Well, it is a superhero movie and emotionless faces with chin guards are for villains.The main weapon of Steel is his sledgehammer, pimped with a sonic gun, stun gun, short focus laser, a grenade launcher and high-powered magnet. The long-range capabilities come equipped with a sniper scope. Since the suit is mostly iron, it amplifies the magnetic field of the hammer, enabling to attract anything iron around him, like enemy weapons and trashcan lids.Sadly, jet boots and super strength, along with other over the top features, were left out from the 97-minute film about a guy building power armor in a 97s junkyard. However, there were also improvements. There is no red cape, or a gigantic ""S"" on his chest. Later DC versions of Steel retained this, setting him apart from Superman.The resulting ""armor"" satisfied both the look of the character and the filming physical requirements. After completion, with all its pieces and layering, it took 3 costumers an hour to transform John Henry into Steel.Shaq had to do all of his own stunts because the producers were unable to find a 2.16m stunt double for him.Other movie features include a customized humvee, van, motorbike and wheelchair. As far as superhero movies go, this one didn't fall as flat as more popular hero films that altered the original story. Steel costume may look like a cheap Robocop mockup, but at least you can RUN in it without CGI. Let's see you make a better suit without CGI! I dare you!

4.0,"Sort of like ""Iron Man"" meets ""Sanford and Son"".","""Steel"" is, by accounts, a bad movie. It's IMDB score is currently an appalling 2.8 and it was on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List until recently. Why is it no longer on the list? Well, the new standards say that a movie must have 10,000 votes to be eligible for this list of worst-rated films...and ""Steel"" is 103 votes shy...meaning it may just be on the list in the near future if it can get more votes....and would rest about #22 on the list. And, incidentally, Shaquille O'Neal was nominated for the worst actor Razzie for this performance. So why did I watch it? I have a weird passion...to see all 100 on the list...because many are simply hilarious and aren't intended to be! So is ""Steel"" as bad as its score would indicate? No. Now it is NOT a good film....but I can think of hundreds of worse movies. Certainly NOT a ringing endorsement!When the film begins, John Henry Irons (Shaquille O'Neal) is in the army and there is a test of a new super-weapon. The baddie in the film, Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson), did not listen to John's instructions and there's an awful accident. Nathaniel is rightfully tossed from the service and John quits because he wants to work on weapons that neutralize the enemy...not kill them.Skip ahead a bit of time and suddenly an LA gang is using a weapon based on the technology that John and Nathaniel developed. John realized that Nathaniel must have gone evil and is about to make a killing selling these dangerous weapons to the highest bidders. So, it's up to John to create his own super tools--with not only a high powered neutralizing gun but a steel suit to protect him from Nathaniel's evil weapons.So is it terrible? No. It's not good...but not terrible. O'Neal is a bit wooden, I admit it, but he also is pretty cute in his scenes with his grandma....and I think the film would have been better with more of these sorts of scenes. The plot is a bit silly and in many ways, the film comes off like merging ""Iron Man"" (with O'Neal being a brilliant inventor and superhero like Tony Stark) and ""Sanford and Son"", as John's hideout is in a junk yard and his costume, in part, is made from junk. The bottom line is that the film isn't much fun BUT it didn't seem awful or painful to watch...which disappointed me because I was hoping the film would totally embarrass O'Neal.",sort like iron man meets sanford son,steel is by accounts bad movie its imdb score is currently appalling 2 8 it was imdbs infamous bottom 100 list until recently why is it no longer list well new standards say that movie must have 10 000 votes be eligible this list worst rated films steel is 103 votes shy meaning it may just be list near future if it can get more votes would rest about list incidentally shaquille oneal was nominated worst actor razzie this performance so why did i watch it i have weird passion see all 100 list because many are simply hilarious arent intended be so is steel as bad as its score would indicate no now it is not good film but i can think hundreds worse movies certainly not ringing endorsement when film begins john henry irons shaquille oneal is army there is test new super weapon baddie film nathaniel burke judd nelson did not listen johns instructions theres awful accident nathaniel is rightfully tossed service john quits because he wants work weapons that neutralize enemy not kill them skip ahead bit time suddenly la gang is using weapon based technology that john nathaniel developed john realized that nathaniel must have gone evil is about make killing selling these dangerous weapons highest bidders so its up john create his own super tools with not only high powered neutralizing gun but steel suit protect him nathaniels evil weapons so is it terrible no its not good but not terrible oneal is bit wooden i admit it but he also is pretty cute his scenes with his grandma i think film would have been better with more these sorts scenes plot is bit silly many ways film comes off like merging iron man with oneal being brilliant inventor superhero like tony stark sanford son as johns hideout is junk yard his costume part is made junk bottom line is that film isnt much fun but it didnt seem awful or painful watch which disappointed me because i was hoping film would totally embarrass oneal,0.6882747113997114,-0.13870310245310244,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7.0,Easy on the eyes,"I do get angry when a movie is unjustly slated and I am angry now. What some people should appreciate is that some movies are not made in order to give us an insight into the meaning of life. They are just there to be enjoyed. I enjoyed Steel. It is a good movie about making a difference, a moral movie without any pretensions of grandeur. If someone said to me that the makers of this movie had the same kind of budget as those who made X-men for instance, then I would certainly of expected more. But I am sure they did not and made the best of what they had. Okay Shaq is no Olivier but so what!! At least he was prepared to give it a go and I think he did okay. All the actors did. To conclude I liked the movie Steel and if it was available to purchase in the UK and would buy it. Please do not watch a movie having prejudged it, be practical and know that there are limitations and not all film producers have big budgets. This movie was well told, and the actors did the job.",easy eyes,i do get angry when movie is unjustly slated i am angry now what some people should appreciate is that some movies are not made order give us insight into meaning life they are just there be enjoyed i enjoyed steel it is good movie about making difference moral movie without any pretensions grandeur if someone said me that makers this movie had same kind budget as those who made x men instance then i would certainly expected more but i am sure they did not made best what they had okay shaq is no olivier but so what at least he was prepared give it go i think he did okay all actors did conclude i liked movie steel if it was available purchase uk would buy it please do not watch movie having prejudged it be practical know that there are limitations not all film producers have big budgets this movie was well told actors did job,0.5735380116959066,0.2807017543859649,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.36}"
