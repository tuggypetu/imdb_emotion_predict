9.0,Refreshingly heart warming .... a Gem.,"In times when the big banners disappoint and the obvious ones turn out to be the unexpected, a film played its subtle chords and rendered itself in the most touching manner to leave the viewer pleased, satisfied and moved. 'Dasvidaniya' achieves more than what the big films fail to. It moves you with only its simplicity and sincerity. Loosely based on the premise of Anand and Bucket List, Dasvidaniya (Russian for 'Goodbye') is an inspiring film that is not even epic in proportions mainly due to its simple nature and outstanding performances with Vinay Pathak being the unequivocal re-discovery of the year. This film is a surprise. And a very pleasing one.Amar Kaul (Vinay Pathak) is the symbolic 'loser'. The below average introvert who always gets pushed around or dominated, neglected and lost in the very simplicity of life with aspirations hidden behind the veil of the mundane routines of his life. He is your most unfashionable accounts manager in a private company whose insatiable boss simply reminds Amar of his lowly existence. At home, his half deaf mother lives with a struggling remote to the soap opera infected T.V., always whining, always complaining. While Amar's life is what one can easily identify with because we have known such 'losers' in life, we are surprised by his humble and tolerant nature to the events and people in his life. One day, he discovers that his life will no longer be the same as it has been and before it gives up on him, he should live it up to the very end. 'Iske pehle ki life tumhe kha jaaye, tum zindagi ko pee jaao' is what was suggested to him at a bar. Amar's self appears in front of him and reminds him that fixing the bathroom geyser or putting new batteries in the T.V. remote are not items worthy of his life's list of things to do. Thus, Amar enlists 10 real aspirations and pursues each one with all that he has. One cannot really tell what the most beautiful aspect of the film is that makes it so heart warming. Is it the story telling or is it Amar's character that Pathak enacts so brilliantly? Debutant director Shahant Shah leaves us overwhelmed with his presentation style that makes the film classy in its own sense while being simple enough with the story telling. The film just flows through to your heart effortlessly and it strikes the right chord that will leave you with a lump in the throat at times or giggling away at the jokes it throws at you. As Amar sets out on his journey to accomplish his aspirations, he faces challenges that throw the reality of life at him but his spirit of living it up enables him to confront that reality with a smile. He is very practical in situations and realistic in dealing with the truth about his life. The subtlety connects to your emotional side and you fall in love with the simpleton 'loser'. While the film centers around Vinay Pathak, who leaves us astounded with the most remarkable and definitive performance of his career as well as this year, there are some special characters that are worthy of a mention because they have been played by some fine actors. Neha Dhupia is refreshing as Amar's childhood love, his 'chaddi' pal Rajiv (Rajat Kapoor) is at his fine form yet again after the duo split us in laughter in Bheja Fry, Sarita Joshi plays the role of the eccentric mother convincingly with just a few shades of overacting when her son buys a new car. .Vivek, the estranged brother, the boss played by Saurabh Shukla, Ranvir Shorey as the funky frequenter at the bar and Joy Fernandes in a convincingly hilarious role of 'Savio', the Guitar teacher. Kailash Kher's melodies are soothing and suit the film's different moods. The script, dialogues and screenplay with the touch of humour make this film a pleasant story rather than a serious drama and Shashant Shah's direction simply puts all the fine elements together to portray this touching tale in the finest presentation format. Hearts will be warmed with the subtle touches, tears will be shed for the resemblances, laughter will roar after funny dialogues and while one acknowledges the pleasant aspects of this film, the revelation of Vinay Pathak's finesse will only add to the cherishable experience of Dasvidaniya. - 9.09 on a scale of 1-10.",refreshingly heart warming gem,times when big banners disappoint obvious ones turn out be unexpected film played its subtle chords rendered itself most touching manner leave viewer pleased satisfied moved dasvidaniya achieves more than what big films fail it moves you with only its simplicity sincerity loosely based premise anand bucket list dasvidaniya russian goodbye is inspiring film that is not even epic proportions mainly due its simple nature outstanding performances with vinay pathak being unequivocal re discovery year this film is surprise very pleasing one amar kaul vinay pathak is symbolic loser below average introvert who always gets pushed around or dominated neglected lost very simplicity life with aspirations hidden behind veil mundane routines his life he is your most unfashionable accounts manager private company whose insatiable boss simply reminds amar his lowly existence at home his half deaf mother lives with struggling remote soap opera infected t v always whining always complaining while amars life is what one can easily identify with because we have known such losers life we are surprised by his humble tolerant nature events people his life one day he discovers that his life will no longer be same as it has been before it gives up him he should live it up very end iske pehle ki life tumhe kha jaaye tum zindagi ko pee jaao is what was suggested him at bar amars self appears front him reminds him that fixing bathroom geyser or putting new batteries t v remote are not items worthy his lifes list things do thus amar enlists 10 real aspirations pursues each one with all that he has one cannot really tell what most beautiful aspect film is that makes it so heart warming is it story telling or is it amars character that pathak enacts so brilliantly debutant director shahant shah leaves us overwhelmed with his presentation style that makes film classy its own sense while being simple enough with story telling film just flows through your heart effortlessly it strikes right chord that will leave you with lump throat at times or giggling away at jokes it throws at you as amar sets out his journey accomplish his aspirations he faces challenges that throw reality life at him but his spirit living it up enables him confront that reality with smile he is very practical situations realistic dealing with truth about his life subtlety connects your emotional side you fall love with simpleton loser while film centers around vinay pathak who leaves us astounded with most remarkable definitive performance his career as well as this year there are some special characters that are worthy mention because they have been played by some fine actors neha dhupia is refreshing as amars childhood love his chaddi pal rajiv rajat kapoor is at his fine form yet again after duo split us laughter bheja fry sarita joshi plays role eccentric mother convincingly with just few shades overacting when her son buys new car vivek estranged brother boss played by saurabh shukla ranvir shorey as funky frequenter at bar joy fernandes convincingly hilarious role savio guitar teacher kailash khers melodies are soothing suit films different moods script dialogues screenplay with touch humour make this film pleasant story rather than serious drama shashant shahs direction simply puts all fine elements together portray this touching tale finest presentation format hearts will be warmed with subtle touches tears will be shed resemblances laughter will roar after funny dialogues while one acknowledges pleasant aspects this film revelation vinay pathaks finesse will only add cherishable experience dasvidaniya 9 09 scale 1 10,0.5463093816752352,0.19552875985802812,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8.0,"Simple, heartwarming and inspiring","I'm in complete awe of this wonderful film. Dasvidaniya easily ranks amongst the finest films of 2008 - poignant, moving, uplifting. It is brilliantly written and narrated, superbly acted and very well directed. This is the story of Amar Kaul, a 37 year-old single man who lives with his old mother and who is diagnosed with cancer. Knowing that he has only counted months to live, he decides to form a list of 10 things he must do before he dies. It's then when the life of this ordinary man turns into an extraordinary journey spanning only several months but leaving countless memories for those who accompanied him on his way.Those who are very well aware of the style people use to associate with Hindi films, may mistakenly expect the film to be overly cliché and melodramatic. But Dasvidaniya is the complete opposite. It is emotional but without any overdone dramatisation of the story. It is simple, subtle, humorous and authentic, and that's what makes it the more so involving and enjoyable. The dialogues are very good, and the film, though seems to be quite depressing at the surface, is heartwarming and inspiring alike, managing to tug at your heartstrings on many occasions and making you understand how important it is to live life to the fullest and cherish every moment of it.Vinay Pathak is the film's main protagonist. Pathak is a very unconventional kind of a hero, but his portrayal of Amar is so heartfelt, convincing and sincere that it truly emerges as one of the finest performances of the year, which he will probably be most remembered for. Pathak is supported by a terrific ensemble of actors, all of whom play their roles excellently. Neha Dhupia is lovable in a small but pivotal role as the love of Amar's life, Neha. Rajat Kapoor is fantastic as his best friend Rajiv. Russian actress Manoylo Svitlana is endearing as Tatiana, a prostitute with whom Amar experiences true love for the first time in his life. Sarita Joshi and Gaurav Gera are wonderful as Amar's mother and brother, respectively.Kailash Kher's soundtrack for the film is great. The songs are well composed and perfectly fit the situations presented on-screen. So does the background score. The film's ending is very optimistic and relieving despite its sad nature. Dasvidaniya is a moving and memorable picture. Shashant Shah is a very promising director, showing a very unique style of storytelling. I highly recommend you to watch this rare piece.",simple heartwarming inspiring,im complete awe this wonderful film dasvidaniya easily ranks amongst finest films 2008 poignant moving uplifting it is brilliantly written narrated superbly acted very well directed this is story amar kaul 37 year old single man who lives with his old mother who is diagnosed with cancer knowing that he has only counted months live he decides form list 10 things he must do before he dies its then when life this ordinary man turns into extraordinary journey spanning only several months but leaving countless memories those who accompanied him his way those who are very well aware style people use associate with hindi films may mistakenly expect film be overly clich melodramatic but dasvidaniya is complete opposite it is emotional but without any overdone dramatisation story it is simple subtle humorous authentic thats what makes it more so involving enjoyable dialogues are very good film though seems be quite depressing at surface is heartwarming inspiring alike managing tug at your heartstrings many occasions making you understand how important it is live life fullest cherish every moment it vinay pathak is films main protagonist pathak is very unconventional kind hero but his portrayal amar is so heartfelt convincing sincere that it truly emerges as one finest performances year which he will probably be most remembered pathak is supported by terrific ensemble actors all whom play their roles excellently neha dhupia is lovable small but pivotal role as love amars life neha rajat kapoor is fantastic as his best friend rajiv russian actress manoylo svitlana is endearing as tatiana prostitute with whom amar experiences true love first time his life sarita joshi gaurav gera are wonderful as amars mother brother respectively kailash khers soundtrack film is great songs are well composed perfectly fit situations presented screen so does background score films ending is very optimistic relieving despite its sad nature dasvidaniya is moving memorable picture shashant shah is very promising director showing very unique style storytelling i highly recommend you watch this rare piece,0.6156503198294242,0.29654923434774183,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Dasvidaniya - a movie that touches the emotional string,"Dasvidaniya.. the best goodbye ever. Is that one movie which manages to pull down that tear you shed way back when you watched Aamir Khan's TZP. Dasvidaniya is one of its kind. Now damn you people who think this story is a lift off from the English movie The Bucket List. I can very well tell the writer may be just influenced while he was actually writing the story of Dasvidaniya and its nothing more than a influence. He's managed to write a gem of a script and another gem of an actor to compliment it. Who else could it be who could've played the role of Amar Kaul better than Vinay Pathak. He plays Amar Kaul, a 37 year old lonesome man who only has his mother as the person in his life. Following which he finds his sudden illness during its last stage. The movie starts pacing well, when he does all those things he ever wished to do once after finding out about his illness.The characters that follow in his life after that are to watch out for. Movies of Vinay Pathak do not end without Rajath Kapoor and Ranvir Shorey making their appearance and yet again all three of them compliment each other. The roles of Amar Kaul's mother and his childhood love interest played by Sarita Joshi and Neha Dhupia respectively have done their bit convincingly. Its definitely the career best performance of Vinay Pathak. This is not the first time you've see him pull off such a stupendous performance. He adds that extra quotient to the movie as he always does. The music is the icing on the cake. Kailash Kher provides that special touch of music which embraces you as you continue watching the movie. Summing up.. Dasvidaniya becomes a must watch!!! Its a movie you're gonna remember for a long long time to come. High time Vinay Pathak is respected as an actor. An obvious 10 on 10 for Shashant Shah's Dasvidaniya.

10.0,Milestone Movie,"Rare comes movies containing performances so restrained, warmth so resurrecting and wit at its best. (in Bollywood) The Protagonist, Amar sketches a character of a man who leads his usual middle-class, mundane and uneventful life, which is presumably already dead, only to find out he is suffering from stomach cancer. Decides to carry forward his life with the remaining moments raring to go, prepares a ""to do list before i die"". Accomplishing the deeds, one by one, is a treat to watch specially sequences like revealing out to the women you loved all your life, no matter she is happily married right now and standing against up to your devilish boss.

8.0,Simple Story about a Simple Man. Enchanting!!,"Vinay Pathak just keeps on amazing with his acting skills. He reminds me of the magic that Farooq Sheikh and Amol Palekar created in the early 80s with simple stories and outstanding acting. I think most of us can identify with Amar Kaul in one way or the other. Neha Dhupia whom I never thought of as an actress looked beautiful without her make-up and player her sweet cameo beautifully. Rajat Kapoor and all others were equally good in their roles. Neha's episode was my favorite when he acknowledges love for her in the rain. Also the Russian girl did well. All in all, everything was perfect for me in this movie with no overly-done melodrama. The only thing disappointing was the lack of the ending theme (piano/guitar part) on the OST CD. Kailash Kher has created a poignant yet soulful melody. The ending scene where Amar's brother and his friend go over his list was the strongest scene (and the following theme) along with Neha's scene. I will definitely rate this and ""Amal"" as one of the strongest movies to come out of Bollywood in a long long time. 10/10",simple story about simple man enchanting,vinay pathak just keeps amazing with his acting skills he reminds me magic that farooq sheikh amol palekar created early 80s with simple stories outstanding acting i think most us can identify with amar kaul one way or other neha dhupia whom i never thought as actress looked beautiful without her make up player her sweet cameo beautifully rajat kapoor all others were equally good their roles nehas episode was my favorite when he acknowledges love her rain also russian girl did well all all everything was perfect me this movie with no overly done melodrama only thing disappointing was lack ending theme piano guitar part ost cd kailash kher has created poignant yet soulful melody ending scene where amars brother his friend go over his list was strongest scene following theme along with nehas scene i will definitely rate this amal as one strongest movies come out bollywood long long time 10 10,0.5433862433862434,0.2157407407407408,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,A story of a common man told in a very uncommon way,"(Same as in my own blog - shazl.blogspot) An excellent movie after a very very long time which wouldn't be forgotten very soon.

9.0,The Simplest Good bye ever!!!!,"Finally Comes a movie, which reminds us the beauty of simplicity. A forgotten way of life, where we were relaxed, and enjoyed the life; rather than running after the things to acquire materialistic pleasure.Dasvidaniya, is I must say the simplest goodbye ever. Its a movie about a guy who is suffering from Stomach Cancer and is about to die in next 3 months. So this is the story of those months, where he takes the control of his life, and decides to correct out his mistakes, and enjoy the pleasures, which he totally ignored till this point of time.A simple story, and also directed very simply, with not a single character going overboard to portray his/her emotions. All the characters in this movie have done great job, except from Neha Dhupia, she was not very comfortable playing the role of a next door girl.Vinay Pathak steals the show, with his subtle portrayal of the emotions of a dying man. He has kept it simple and stupid. The movies makes you laugh a lot, and also sometimes makes you cry. The songs ""Mumma"" and ""Alvida"" sung by ""kailash kher"" are also very apt to the story.The movie fill you with joy, but it has its share of drawback, if only you would like to call it a drawback. Dasvidaniya is too simple to effect you, or to impact you. It definitely touches you, but it does not go inside you.

10.0,Best movie of 2008,"Usually all of us make movie-watching decisions based on the reviews we read – IMDb, Rajeev Masand on CNN-IBN, Khalid Mohammed in Hindustan Times or Raja Sen on rediff. If you read at least a couple of these reviews, you usually get a very good idea of what a particular movie is like. I have another personal test – admittedly a sort of rough indicator. In case of mainstream Hindi movies, just look at the schedule of a multiplex when the movie is released. So if a movie has 6-7 shows a day, it's a decent movie – while movies with just 1-2 shows in the first week are just bad. In case of a 'multiplex movie' like Johhny Gaddaar, it's the second week schedule to watch out for.However, sometimes these calculations go quite wrong. Dasvidaniya is one such movie. (In its second week, its running just 2 shows a day in all multiplexes – and all major reviews have given it two stars, blaming the slow narration and/or ridiculing the contents of the final list). And I thought it was one of the best movies of this year.Just for those few of you who don't know what the movie is about, it's about a common man – Amar Kaul – who leads a very dull and inconsequential middle class life, with nothing to look forward to except for his obsession with 'to-do' lists. He makes them everyday, ticking off things that he accomplishes – till he gets to know that he is terminally ill and has just three months to live.As he did during his lifetime, he decides to make a final list – 'Things to do (before I die)' and sets out to fulfill them.But this movie is too much to be summarized by just this one line! Sure that's the essence, but the movie has to be watched to appreciate the wonderfully tender moments captured by the director. Vinay Pathak plays the man with just three months to live, who suddenly has to fulfill a lifetime of ambitions – wishes which had been buried under the daily grind of existence. And the beauty of the script is in the things he chooses to put on the list. Nothing exotic or deliberated. Just simple heartfelt desires that probably most of us have – buying his first car or going on his first 'foreign trip'. Seeing his first and only crush Neha one final time - or meeting his childhood best-friend Rajiv before he dies.Some experiences are heartwarming, like his mom's reaction on seeing the new car - and some bittersweet, like finding out Neha is now married and a mother. There are many more touching moments - the final parting between Rajiv and Amar and making peace with Vivek – which linger on after the movie. Vinay Pathak gives a wonderful performance, first reflecting desperation, then a breakdown and finally a wistful acceptance of fate. Kailash Kher has given his unique touch to the music – and while Alvida is the number which everyone is humming, the Maa song is very nicely picturized (without too much overt sentimentality) – and is catchy too.Not all is perfect with the movie though – Amar's alter ego's appearance is a little jarring and he should have had less screen time. The Russian's popping-up act is also a little weird – but it also gives the movie its unique flavor. And if you think about it, how much money would an account manager's provident fund be left with, after a Rs. 9 lakh car and a round trip to the US ?? And wouldn't you want to leave it all to your mother instead?But inspite of these loopholes, this movie is one of the most warm and thoughtful movies to come out of Bollywood in sometime. The director cheekily doffs his hat to mainstream movies Kal Ho Naa Ho and Munnabhai – and indulges in a bit of genuinely funny situational comedy, but you would remember the movie for touching your heart in its earnestness and simplicity.",best movie 2008,usually all us make movie watching decisions based reviews we read imdb rajeev masand cnn ibn khalid mohammed hindustan times or raja sen rediff if you read at least couple these reviews you usually get very good idea what particular movie is like i have another personal test admittedly sort rough indicator case mainstream hindi movies just look at schedule multiplex when movie is released so if movie has 6 7 shows day its decent movie while movies with just 1 2 shows first week are just bad case multiplex movie like johhny gaddaar its second week schedule watch out however sometimes these calculations go quite wrong dasvidaniya is one such movie its second week its running just 2 shows day all multiplexes all major reviews have given it two stars blaming slow narration or ridiculing contents final list i thought it was one best movies this year just those few you who dont know what movie is about its about common man amar kaul who leads very dull inconsequential middle class life with nothing look forward except his obsession with do lists he makes them everyday ticking off things that he accomplishes till he gets know that he is terminally ill has just three months live as he did during his lifetime he decides make final list things do before i die sets out fulfill them but this movie is too much be summarized by just this one line sure thats essence but movie has be watched appreciate wonderfully tender moments captured by director vinay pathak plays man with just three months live who suddenly has fulfill lifetime ambitions wishes which had been buried under daily grind existence beauty script is things he chooses put list nothing exotic or deliberated just simple heartfelt desires that probably most us have buying his first car or going his first foreign trip seeing his first only crush neha one final time or meeting his childhood best friend rajiv before he dies some experiences are heartwarming like his moms reaction seeing new car some bittersweet like finding out neha is now married mother there are many more touching moments final parting between rajiv amar making peace with vivek which linger after movie vinay pathak gives wonderful performance first reflecting desperation then breakdown finally wistful acceptance fate kailash kher has given his unique touch music while alvida is number which everyone is humming maa song is very nicely picturized without too much overt sentimentality is catchy too not all is perfect with movie though amars alter egos appearance is little jarring he should have had less screen time russians popping up act is also little weird but it also gives movie its unique flavor if you think about it how much money would account managers provident fund be left with after rs 9 lakh car round trip us wouldnt you want leave it all your mother instead but inspite these loopholes this movie is one most warm thoughtful movies come out bollywood sometime director cheekily doffs his hat mainstream movies kal ho naa ho munnabhai indulges bit genuinely funny situational comedy but you would remember movie touching your heart its earnestness simplicity,0.5357939600082458,0.16070129870129868,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,An Endearing Farewell,"Though it might bear some resemblance to 'Anand' and 'The Bucket List', 'Dasvidaniya' is very much its own film (and far better than 'The Bucket List' and 'Kal Ho Na Ho'). With its sheer subtlety, simplicity and touch of humour, it reminds me of the beauty of Iranian films. Rookie director Shashant Shah gives the film a unique treatment. It amazes me how a first time film director could make such a subtle film with so much attention to detail and astonishing use of symbolism.'Dasvidaniya' could have easily become just another melodramatic tearjerker but Shah's wonderful sense of humour and poetic narration make this more than a pleasant experience and the character Amar Kaul is so big hearted (but at the same time easily relatable) that the viewer, while sympathizing with his illness, feels joy as he achieves his goal and shares his triumph. The entire film focuses on Amar Kaul, a typical loser and loner who works at a call centre(?). But, as the story continues, we discover that Kaul is no longer a mere loser. He is and has always been a man with a big heart but just like many he just lost his way somewhere in life and now strives to make the best of his last couple of months and live his life. Arshad Sayed deserves mention for the terrific screenplay and humorous and witty dialogues.Vinay Pathak is phenomenal. Finally he gets the lead role every good actor would dream of and he totally nails it. This is easily one of the best performances of the year. He is supported by a strong cast that includes: a food-addicted bossy Saurabh Shukla, a vivacious Neha Dhupia, a fine Rajat Kapoor (with whom Amar shares everything giving him the bigger part and keeping the smaller piece to himself...including that of life), an eccentric Sarita Joshi, a hilarious Joy Fernandes, a convincing Gaurav Gera, a flamboyant Ranvir Shorey and a refreshing Manoylo Svitlana.There are quite a few songs but I loved them all and they add to the expressions of the scene's mood. Kailash Kher can surely sing passionately.'Dasvidaniya' is one of the rare Indian films of the year (and quite simply one of the finest) where it all, that is, direction, screenplay, acting, music and so on, beautifully fits together.

9.0,Makes your heart bleed: How a common man lives out his dreams,"There are times when a movie makes you feel like crap, and there are times when a movie makes you realize life is good. Dasvidaniya falls in the later group. Dasvidaniya is the story of a common man who is terminally ill. He makes a wish-list... and lives each thing one by one. This movie will actually make your heart bleed. Because the story of Amar is our story. We do not live our dreams because we have the illusion that the end is far and we have enough time. But later realize time eluded us and we have not lived a single one of our dreams. This movie shows you what life can be only if we strive to achieve what our heart says. No time is short if you enjoy and live out every moment of our lives. Vinay Pathak, as usual, is brilliant. So are all the others. I simply never thought I would some day watch a bollywood movie where all of the characters are perfect and all the actors are at their best. This is truly a milestone. Everything about this movie is perfect, except for the 'Love' aspect of it. Vinay finds love in the arms of a Russian 'less-than-honourable' lady. Something about the situation here does not feel right. Their encounter is realistic but not their relationship. This movie truly deserves to be sent to the Oscars in the foreign film category, for India - and not craps like Devdaas and the rest of the bunch (I do not ever remember what they were!). This is what true movie making is about. This is called portraying true emotions on screen and sucking you into it. Its a shame that this movie has been defeated at the BO. I guess Indian audience has to go a long way to choose this over Dostana or the latest Bond flick.",makes your heart bleed how common man lives out his dreams,there are times when movie makes you feel like crap there are times when movie makes you realize life is good dasvidaniya falls later group dasvidaniya is story common man who is terminally ill he makes wish list lives each thing one by one this movie will actually make your heart bleed because story amar is our story we do not live our dreams because we have illusion that end is far we have enough time but later realize time eluded us we have not lived single one our dreams this movie shows you what life can be only if we strive achieve what our heart says no time is short if you enjoy live out every moment our lives vinay pathak as usual is brilliant so are all others i simply never thought i would some day watch bollywood movie where all characters are perfect all actors are at their best this is truly milestone everything about this movie is perfect except love aspect it vinay finds love arms russian less than honourable lady something about situation here does not feel right their encounter is realistic but not their relationship this movie truly deserves be sent oscars foreign film category india not craps like devdaas rest bunch i do not ever remember what they were this is what true movie making is about this is called portraying true emotions screen sucking you into it its shame that this movie has been defeated at bo i guess indian audience has go long way choose this over dostana or latest bond flick,0.5085497835497836,0.15931719795356158,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,One of the underrated gems of Bollywood,"One line review: An amazing watch with a bitter sweet ending that puts a smile on your face. Dasvidaniya, Russian for 'good bye', is a story of a last stage cancer patient saying good bye to his life and every person who played a part in it. The name of the movie is also a pun on 'bucket list of ten things to do before I Die' made by the protagonist. Amar Kaul is your average middle class Indian guy. He is a sincere, calm and loves his mother. Every morning he wakes up and makes a 'to do list' of things he wishes to accomplish in the day. He has a non complaining attitude towards the world he lives in, never complaining his boss about the work, or to his best friend about the sacrifices he made. He never smoked, drank or did anything outside his routine of affairs. Amar's world collapses around him when he learns that he is at the last stage of stomach cancer, with only three months to live. This revelation comes with a realisation that in his 37 years of existence, he has hardly fulfilled any of his wishes. The next morning, he wakes up and makes a list of things he wants to finish before he dies. Its a tentative list, with more items added later in the movie, a total of ten of them to be exact, which he does cross off before he breathes his last. His 'list' reflects stupid desires that we all hold, like buying a new car, going for a foreign trip, learn guitar, confessing to his childhood love! One of the most emotional scenes in the movies arrives during his declaration of love to Neha, his childhood love, through a game of dumb charades, a game they always used to play as a team. Neha is now married and has a daughter, but Amar can't die without letting her know that he has always loved her. Another important scene is Amar's head to head with his brother. After all family is the most important thing and one will go to lengths to save it, like Amar's mumma does by taking him to all the babas to save his life. In the end, he brings all important members of his life together. He leaves a gift for everyone behind. He leaves his house for rent to the agent who sold him car, a record of bollywood song to his Russian girlfriend, an album of childhood photos for his love Neha, his car to his guitar instructor. For his best friend he leaves nothing but for me there was a hidden meaning in that action. He has always sacrificed larger share of best stuff for his friend. His best friend keeps the 'list' for himself as a memoir of the life loving person Amar was!I would definitely recommend this movie to every person ever. Those of us who complain about the deteriorating quality of Bollywood movies, should definitely sit back and enjoy underrated gems like Dasvidaniya.",one underrated gems bollywood,one line review amazing watch with bitter sweet ending that puts smile your face dasvidaniya russian good bye is story last stage cancer patient saying good bye his life every person who played part it name movie is also pun bucket list ten things do before i die made by protagonist amar kaul is your average middle class indian guy he is sincere calm loves his mother every morning he wakes up makes do list things he wishes accomplish day he has non complaining attitude towards world he lives never complaining his boss about work or his best friend about sacrifices he made he never smoked drank or did anything outside his routine affairs amars world collapses around him when he learns that he is at last stage stomach cancer with only three months live this revelation comes with realisation that his 37 years existence he has hardly fulfilled any his wishes next morning he wakes up makes list things he wants finish before he dies its tentative list with more items added later movie total ten them be exact which he does cross off before he breathes his last his list reflects stupid desires that we all hold like buying new car going foreign trip learn guitar confessing his childhood love one most emotional scenes movies arrives during his declaration love neha his childhood love through game dumb charades game they always used play as team neha is now married has daughter but amar cant die without letting her know that he has always loved her another important scene is amars head head with his brother after all family is most important thing one will go lengths save it like amars mumma does by taking him all babas save his life end he brings all important members his life together he leaves gift everyone behind he leaves his house rent agent who sold him car record bollywood song his russian girlfriend album childhood photos his love neha his car his guitar instructor his best friend he leaves nothing but me there was hidden meaning that action he has always sacrificed larger share best stuff his friend his best friend keeps list himself as memoir life loving person amar was i would definitely recommend this movie every person ever those us who complain about deteriorating quality bollywood movies should definitely sit back enjoy underrated gems like dasvidaniya,0.4263482280431433,0.19854904982023627,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.25}"

After all, many Bollywood films are rip-offs of Hollywood films and often they don't even credit the original film. However, fortunately, it was not and was instead original and well worth seeing.Amar (Vinay Pathak) is a very dull man leading a very predictable life. However, when he learns from his doctor that he's dying and only has about two months to live, he has a discussion with his alter- ego...and decides he's going to make the most of his time left by making a bucket list and completing it. But this list does not include crazy stuff like skydiving or scuba, it's more about missed opportunities...and Amar is determined not to die with these opportunities being resolved.I liked so much about this film. I loved that Amar was a very ordinary, pudgy guy and not the typical virile Bollywood character. Vinay Pathak is certainly NOT Shah Rukh Khan...and for this film that worked perfectly. I also appreciated how Amar's list was not selfish and all about fun. Overall, it's certainly not a comedy but a film that affirms living life to its fullest.

This kind of kissing up only marred the film, rather that give it the hip factor they were perhaps looking for.

7.0,Dasvidaniya - start making lists,"Vinay Pathak was simply amazing in the movie - Dasvidaniya, there are moments in the movie that really make you feel sad, and upset about the character dying, upset to the point being that - Now, he is living life to the fullest. The alter ego of Vinay Pathak wears some real amazing pointed red shoes.Plot of the movie is there is Amar Kaul (played by Vinay Pathak) being informed that he is going to die, and now he starts wishing that all things that he ever wanted to do and puts it on TTD - Things to do lists that one puts together, then he puts his ultimate list ""10 things to do before I die"".Gaurav Gera, as the younger brother and short lived character had an impactful performance, specially when he shared screen Vinay Pathak and mother Sarita Joshi. Neha Dhupia was a the person that he loves the most turns out to be that she has already married and he is very upset about it. Similarly, Rajat Kapoor, Ranvir Shorey - who also have contributed to the movie beautifully. It may not be the commercially most successful movie, but it does touch hearts of the people.The other thing that touches the heart of the people was the songs were also very to the point, specially when he started singing Maa, it was very meaningful and had it own time value in the movie.

7.0,"Worth Seeing, though a bit cliché.","You have seen it several times before on the screen that a person is told that he will be dying in few days and then he decides to live his life and fulfill all his hidden dreams with all he has got. It was there in Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"", Hrishikesh Mukherjee's ""Anand"", ""Mili"" and some more too. But still ""Dasvidaniya"" manages to entertain you with its gentle approach and brilliant performances.However it was again normal to see that the main idea of making a list of ""Things To Do"" before you die comes from the 2007 released ""The Bucket List"" starring Jack Nicholson & Morgan Freeman. But here the movie concentrates only on one character of Vinay Pathak and revolves around his last wishes to be lived in the remaining time span.The debutante director Shashant Shah, extracts fine performances from every actor in the frame and that makes this movie a worth watching effort. You can relate to the character of ""Amar"" as he writes his last wishes, but only some sequences seem to be predictable, which make you feel 'seen before'. The star cast has all the actors whom you may recall seeing in many comedy serials featuring Vinay and Ranvir. Ranvir also makes a special appearance in the movie as a person who inspires Vinay to go for it. That's really nice to see that they all love to work together as a team and may be that is the reason why the chemistry between all the characters is quite cool & brilliant.The movie starts with an ease and straight away comes to the point without wasting any footage. This rightly tells you the meaning of ""Dasvidaniya"" and also prepares you to see what will follow. Vinay Pathak puts his heart in his lovable act and carries the whole movie on his shoulders. He is supported competently by Saurabh Shukla (the boss), Neha Dhupia (his childhood beloved), Rajat Kapoor (his foreigner doctor friend), Gaurav Gera (his younger brother) and Sarita Joshi (his mother).The use of his ""Guitar Ambition"" is used well, as 8 out of 10 humans have a romantic liking towards guitar and they all wish they could play it. But the sequence with the Guitar Teacher could have been better as it misses to touch you deep down. Another part which could have been avoided or should have been made more interesting is Vinay's stay with the prostitute in foreign and losing his virginity. The plot here had much more scope of comedy and passion but the director played it very loosely.The best scene of the movie is when Vinay confesses his love to Neha in a mute way standing in the rain. Though the scene is brilliantly executed but sadly it is all inspired from a similar scene in ""LOVE ACTUALLY"", where a guy expresses his love to the girl at her doorstep on the Christmas Eve only with his actions.Kailash Kher and his associates have given music and background score too for the movie. What works in their soothing music is the simple arrangement and calmness in the notes. All the songs were not needed in the movie but ""Pyari Maa, Mamma"" stands out and stays in your mind.On the whole, the movie is well directed and acted but what goes against it is the cliché and overused plot of a cancer patient living his last days to the max. Still you should not miss it as it is worth watching once with your loved ones.One point I would like to mention here for all my friends reading this. As I was moving out of the theater I noticed that all the couples, families and people just walked out of the hall returning to the same talks and giggles as usual and no one looked like thinking about the main theme of the movie.In my opinion, movies based on death and similar themes, only have one creative and social motive. And that is to make you remember your end, to make you remind that you also have to face it one day sooner or later. ""Dasvidaniya"" also gives you the same precious lesson that start making your ""Things To Do Before You Die"" List as you never know what will be there when you wake up next morning.",worth seeing though bit clich,you have seen it several times before screen that person is told that he will be dying few days then he decides live his life fulfill all his hidden dreams with all he has got it was there akira kurosawas ikiru hrishikesh mukherjees anand mili some more too but still dasvidaniya manages entertain you with its gentle approach brilliant performances however it was again normal see that main idea making list things do before you die comes 2007 released bucket list starring jack nicholson morgan freeman but here movie concentrates only one character vinay pathak revolves around his last wishes be lived remaining time span debutante director shashant shah extracts fine performances every actor frame that makes this movie worth watching effort you can relate character amar as he writes his last wishes but only some sequences seem be predictable which make you feel seen before star cast has all actors whom you may recall seeing many comedy serials featuring vinay ranvir ranvir also makes special appearance movie as person who inspires vinay go it thats really nice see that they all love work together as team may be that is reason why chemistry between all characters is quite cool brilliant movie starts with ease straight away comes point without wasting any footage this rightly tells you meaning dasvidaniya also prepares you see what will follow vinay pathak puts his heart his lovable act carries whole movie his shoulders he is supported competently by saurabh shukla boss neha dhupia his childhood beloved rajat kapoor his foreigner doctor friend gaurav gera his younger brother sarita joshi his mother use his guitar ambition is used well as 8 out 10 humans have romantic liking towards guitar they all wish they could play it but sequence with guitar teacher could have been better as it misses touch you deep down another part which could have been avoided or should have been made more interesting is vinays stay with prostitute foreign losing his virginity plot here had much more scope comedy passion but director played it very loosely best scene movie is when vinay confesses his love neha mute way standing rain though scene is brilliantly executed but sadly it is all inspired similar scene love actually where guy expresses his love girl at her doorstep christmas eve only with his actions kailash kher his associates have given music background score too movie what works their soothing music is simple arrangement calmness notes all songs were not needed movie but pyari maa mamma stands out stays your mind whole movie is well directed acted but what goes against it is clich overused plot cancer patient living his last days max still you should not miss it as it is worth watching once with your loved ones one point i would like mention here all my friends reading this as i was moving out theater i noticed that all couples families people just walked out hall returning same talks giggles as usual no one looked like thinking about main theme movie my opinion movies based death similar themes only have one creative social motive that is make you remember your end make you remind that you also have face it one day sooner or later dasvidaniya also gives you same precious lesson that start making your things do before you die list as you never know what will be there when you wake up next morning,0.48113504661123707,0.23595764905288713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,V for VJ - V for Vinay,"When MTV first came to cable it was like a dream come true to for us, the music lovers. Back in those days we’ve really enjoyed it for few years, (remember Danny McGill, he was a cool VJ.) Slowly MTV India took over. For a starter, they did a very good job for a few years.Then somethin’ happened, they broke in to two parts & some of them formed Channel V. They too did well at the beginning, I don’t know if that channel now exists or not! Anyways I remembered two unusual VJs from the V, Vinay Pathak & Ranvir Shorey. Together they also hosted a show called Football Crazy. I wonder if they were as good as Danny or not, but they sure are good actors now. I look forward to see what they’re doin’.Recently I saw two great Indian films “Dasvidaniya” and “Oh, My God”. Both of those are very different from each other, both of them are very funny and well scripted. The lead player of both the films is surprisingly The Sloppy Vinay Pathak! Both the directors came up with their debut film. I don’t know where the hell they came from but they sure know how tell a good story which is very funny & at the same time has a moral.I recommend everyone not to miss these two Hindi films!

10.0,Dasvidaniya,"Dasvidaniya is bittersweet situational comedy about a man Amar Kaul (Vinay Pathak), whose existence is easily forgotten among the millions of people in the pool of Mumbai's ever- increasing population. Shy and quiet Amar lives a mundane run of the mill life. His existence is non-existent to people around him. His innocence and his obsession for making his daily TO-DO LIST every morning is what motivates him to look forward to the next day.Discovered with an illness, a doctor gives him 3 months to live. And then begins a journey of a lifetime for Amar, where he sets out to write his FINAL LIST. The List of 10 things to do before he dies, the List that would make his life worthy, before it actually ends. Amar is symbolic of all those people who have always wanted to do things but kept them on hold.",dasvidaniya,dasvidaniya is bittersweet situational comedy about man amar kaul vinay pathak whose existence is easily forgotten among millions people pool mumbais ever increasing population shy quiet amar lives mundane run mill life his existence is non existent people around him his innocence his obsession making his daily do list every morning is what motivates him look forward next day discovered with illness doctor gives him 3 months live then begins journey lifetime amar where he sets out write his final list list 10 things do before he dies list that would make his life worthy before it actually ends amar is symbolic all those people who have always wanted do things but kept them hold,0.44333333333333336,0.023636363636363636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"
