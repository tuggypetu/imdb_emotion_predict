7,"If every mass-action film can be like this, then believe me even Intellectuals will go mad over this genre. Sukumar and Ram Charan opted Class over mindless Mass.","Rangasthalam (2018) : Brief Review -If every mass-action film can be like this, then believe me even Intellectuals will go mad over this genre. Sukumar and Ram Charan opted Class over mindless Mass. Rangasthalam is one of the rare diamond of a mass-action film in the coal mines of south's mindless masala entertainers. There are three kind of audiences, 1st one is masses who appear in majority, 2nd one is classes who watch all kind of classic stuff from all over the world and 3rd one is intellectual who are always hungry for artistical and intelligent cinematic experiences. There is 4th kind, very unknown and very unique who have features of all the 3 kinds mentioned above. I sort of belong to that rare 4th kind and so i am not a big fan of mindless masala entertainers and that's why i don't watch many South films from that genre. It's not like that it's all garbage, there were some great massy flicks made too and i love those films such as recently made KGF, Bahubali and Pokiri from earlier decade just to name a few. Surprisingly, Rangasthalam came out as classy as those massy flicks. To be honest, i did not expect a great film like this from Ram Charan in this genre but since Sukumar was there i had some hopes because i loved his Nenokkadine. Rangasthalam is same old story but with modern techniques of intelligent filmmaking. Like i said, if all mass films can be so perfect like this one then even intellectuals will go gaga over them. Of course, they won't scream out and dance madly in theatres but they will definitely enjoy the solid entertainer. Rangasthalam is one of the finest Ram Charan film i have even seen (original i mean) as well as his one of the finest performance. Acting, writing, dialogues, camerawork, storytelling, music, action and direction everything about this film is far superior than any other typical out an out mass action film of south. In short, our smart Multiplex audience deserves more and more Mass-Action Entertainers like this.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",if every mass action film can be like this then believe me even intellectuals will go mad over this genre sukumar ram charan opted class over mindless mass,rangasthalam 2018 brief review if every mass action film can be like this then believe me even intellectuals will go mad over this genre sukumar ram charan opted class over mindless mass rangasthalam is one rare diamond mass action film coal mines souths mindless masala entertainers there are three kind audiences 1st one is masses who appear majority 2nd one is classes who watch all kind classic stuff all over world 3rd one is intellectual who are always hungry artistical intelligent cinematic experiences there is 4th kind very unknown very unique who have features all 3 kinds mentioned above i sort belong that rare 4th kind so i am not big fan mindless masala entertainers thats why i dont watch many south films that genre its not like that its all garbage there were some great massy flicks made too i love those films such as recently made kgf bahubali pokiri earlier decade just name few surprisingly rangasthalam came out as classy as those massy flicks be honest i did not expect great film like this ram charan this genre but since sukumar was there i had some hopes because i loved his nenokkadine rangasthalam is same old story but with modern techniques intelligent filmmaking like i said if all mass films can be so perfect like this one then even intellectuals will go gaga over them course they wont scream out dance madly theatres but they will definitely enjoy solid entertainer rangasthalam is one finest ram charan film i have even seen original i mean as well as his one finest performance acting writing dialogues camerawork storytelling music action direction everything about this film is far superior than any other typical out out mass action film south short our smart multiplex audience deserves more more mass action entertainers like this rating 7 5 10 by,0.5485059523809525,0.18890476190476188,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10,"Rangasthalam Review: Reinvents the action drama genre in an artistic style and what you get is a phenomenal, extraordinary cinema.","Movie: Rangasthalam (UA): Action Drama - TeluguWhen I found myself nearly missing the golden opportunity of watching this masterpiece at a local theatre near me with English subtitles, I immediately booked the tickets a day before. The moment I left my seat at the end of my film, I felt as if I had been absorbed into the realistic atmosphere of Rangasthalam. I just didn't want to leave it. It's evening and I'm still unable to stop thinking about the film. Positives:Ram Charan is the biggest strength of the film. Just watch him turn into Chittibabu, and as the screenplay keeps progressing, you soon find yourself loving him to the core. It's almost impossible not to like him. Samantha, Aadhi, Prakash Raj and other actors also do justice to the characters they play.RANGASTHALAM might be a long film but the editing is so perfect that you won't really want to have it trimmed it further. Due to the powerful execution, it's hard not to find the film an engaging, extraordinary experience.The film grips from the very first scene and then goes on to entertain till date as it serves the viewers with a perfect dose of action, humour, music, drama and other elements. Everything works extremely well in the film.The visuals are a treat to watch, as the cinematography captures the film in its best form. The action sequences are excellent, terrific and energetic. Every action sequence is praiseworthy.The emotional sequences are masterfully crafted and work with the viewers big time.Many twists and turns are very well-woven into the screenplay. The film is also replete with multiple clapworthy moments.The film is a clean family entertainer.The climax is excellent and one of the biggest highlights of the film.Negatives:NIL.Repeat value: YesRANGASTHALAM is a true masterpiece in each and every aspect. Apart from Ram Charan, kudos to director Sukumar for experimenting with and nearly reinventing the action drama genre, as the result is a phenomenal, extraordinary, unforgettable, class apart action film. It deserves a national award be it for best film, best cinematography or anything but it does deserve: that's how real Indian cinema can be honoured to at least some extent.

8,Rangasthalam is one of the most intense drama from Tollywood in recent times.Sukumar's terrific direction and Ram Charan's career best performance are delight to watch.,"Rangasthalam (2018):We have already seen Sukumar's brilliance in his previous films but what I witnessed in Rangasthalam is a full charged work from Sukumar.When this project started,I was skeptical about it as Megastar informed Sukumar to make a movie without his trademark brain-teasers.But even with such restraints,Sukumar made this film which was set in 1980's.Plot:Chitti Babu (Ram Charan) is a partially deaf, happy-go-lucky man who doesn't let his disability deter him. His brother Kumar Babu (Aadhi Pinisetty) returns from Dubai only to see that nothing in the village has changed. What happens when he decides to go up against the dreaded President garu (Jagapathi Babu)?My Review:Few minutes after watching the film, when you walk out of the theater, your mind goes on an overdrive to find the right words to express your feelings: it's been a while since we've seen such a raw and gritty film in Telugu cinema.The conflict between a good young guy and the ruthless village president is seen in many films in the 1980's. As the story is too familiar, Sukumar has focused on other elements like terrific characters,electrifying scenes and technical brilliance.Also, he has written the characterization of hero Ram Charan differently which is the main strength. Hero playing a guy with hearing problems is somewhat unusual. This handicap is effectively used in driving the story and screenplay. Every twist and turn in the film is based on this deficiency of the hero.Over the years, there's been a fair share of criticism about Sukumar's work - that it has become inaccessible to certain sections of the audience. While he has always focused on how twisted the lives of people are, he comes across as a different, perhaps a more refined, storyteller in Rangasthalam. To narrate a political drama is one thing, but to create such an universe within the parameters of a revenge drama is sheer brilliance. The more you dig into Rangasthalam, the more rewarding it is.Sukumar is known for his ability to redefine an actor's image, but what he does with Ram Charan has to be seen to be believed. For the first time in a long long time, Ram Charan has shed his stardom to truly embody the spirit of the role he's playing, and in doing so, he has not just outdone himself but also proved that there's a lot of untapped potential in him that's waiting to be discovered. Be it in the scenes where he oozes childishness or the ones when you see a broken man that no one can heal, you can see it all in the way his eyes emote.Even with such a rough village girl characterization,Samantha gave her best.Aadhi has done pretty good in Kumar Babu role.Jagapathi Babu is menacing and he was given one of the most intense scenes in the film.Surprise package is Anasuya where both her character Rangamattha and her performance are amazing.The other good side about Sukumar's films is that they have technical brilliance and this film too falls under the same category. The village atmosphere, the rustic look, the ambience etc. are stunning. He simply brings back the rural life to the current era in this film.Rathnavelu and Devi Sri Prasad need to take a bow, not just for delivering picture-perfect visuals and soundtrack, but for also setting the mood of the film with their work. DSP's background score is strong in this one!So,Rangasthalam is one of the most intense drama from Tollywood in recent times.Sukumar's terrific direction and Ram Charan's career best performance are delight to watch.My rating 8/10",rangasthalam is one most intense drama tollywood recent times sukumars terrific direction ram charans career best performance are delight watch,rangasthalam 2018 we have already seen sukumars brilliance his previous films but what i witnessed rangasthalam is full charged work sukumar when this project started i was skeptical about it as megastar informed sukumar make movie without his trademark brain teasers but even with such restraints sukumar made this film which was set 1980s plot chitti babu ram charan is partially deaf happy go lucky man who doesnt let his disability deter him his brother kumar babu aadhi pinisetty returns dubai only see that nothing village has changed what happens when he decides go up against dreaded president garu jagapathi babu my review few minutes after watching film when you walk out theater your mind goes overdrive find right words express your feelings its been while since weve seen such raw gritty film telugu cinema conflict between good young guy ruthless village president is seen many films 1980s as story is too familiar sukumar has focused other elements like terrific characters electrifying scenes technical brilliance also he has written characterization hero ram charan differently which is main strength hero playing guy with hearing problems is somewhat unusual this handicap is effectively used driving story screenplay every twist turn film is based this deficiency hero over years theres been fair share criticism about sukumars work that it has become inaccessible certain sections audience while he has always focused how twisted lives people are he comes across as different perhaps more refined storyteller rangasthalam narrate political drama is one thing but create such universe within parameters revenge drama is sheer brilliance more you dig into rangasthalam more rewarding it is sukumar is known his ability redefine actors image but what he does with ram charan has be seen be believed first time long long time ram charan has shed his stardom truly embody spirit role hes playing doing so he has not just outdone himself but also proved that theres lot untapped potential him thats waiting be discovered be it scenes where he oozes childishness or ones when you see broken man that no one can heal you can see it all way his eyes emote even with such rough village girl characterization samantha gave her best aadhi has done pretty good kumar babu role jagapathi babu is menacing he was given one most intense scenes film surprise package is anasuya where both her character rangamattha her performance are amazing other good side about sukumars films is that they have technical brilliance this film too falls under same category village atmosphere rustic look ambience etc are stunning he simply brings back rural life current era this film rathnavelu devi sri prasad need take bow not just delivering picture perfect visuals soundtrack but also setting mood film with their work dsps background score is strong this one so rangasthalam is one most intense drama tollywood recent times sukumars terrific direction ram charans career best performance are delight watch my rating 8 10,0.5701503357753357,0.1682069088319088,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10,True Telugu movie in ages,"I was awed while watching the movie, a Telugu movie in ages, made with pure heart and soul. You don't see actors on screen, only the characters with full heart and soul. Each character was potrayed beautifully with 200% effort by all the actors. I had my expectations while looking at cast but wow ever actor did more than 200% justice to their characters, which can be directly attributed to director Sukumar's effort in direction department, raw and realistic art work, beautiful cinematography, each and every other department.I was waiting for Sukumar to show his potential on such realistic movie rather than trying to make an intelligent movies which has no heart and soul. We all know what he is capable of but I am finally glad that he decided to work on such a beautiful script like Rangasthalam rather than pointless intellectual movies which I didn't like personally (this is purely because of my affection towards Sukumar, wanting him to make exceptional movies only).Coming to performances, Ramcharan was a standout as Chittibabu, I felt the character deeply realistic like many people we see in villages, innocent, pure at heart and stubborn at the same time, this is an outstanding performance by Ram Charan, I can't say anything about awards/rewards, but he won my heart with this movie.If this movie doesn't win any major Indian awards this year, we can only pray the god to give working brains to the awards committees.This is one of a kind movie came in Telugu after a long time.

10,Genuine Story with lot of reality . Perfectly made movie!!,"What a movie , just blown away with the this kind of story Sukumar wrote. Spell Bound performance by Ram Charan(Chitti babu ) like never before. He became like a clay in the hands of Sukumar,there is just Chitti babu seen through out the movie. This will be his landmark movie. We get to see all the shades of character be it equally strong mentally & physically , emotional , being funny,romantic,family guy,responsible guy,comical,most innocent ,most caring...there is so much to say about Charan as Chitti babu. Ram Charan deserves a national award for truly getting into the skin of Chitti Babu. Samantha(Rama Lakshmi), Chitti babu is incomplete without Rama Lakshmi. She is amazing, Cannot imagine any other except Samantha.She just breaks her own acting records with incredible performance in every movie.She just stands tall & surpasses everyone with her incredible work.Rama Lakshmi is a very strong character with added cuteness, Samantha sunk into it perfectly.Jagapathi Babu(President) is excels in his role,terrifically portrayed.He can just act with his eyes.Experience matters a lot to pull of such an act.Adi pinisetty (Kumar Babu) ,Prakash Raj(Dakshina Murthy),Anasuya(Rangamatha) are so apt for their role, they added lot of value to the story line. Every character in the movie has their importance , no character is just standing there as a prop. Highlights of the movie : -On point Characters sketch & screen play. -Cinematography ( just wow is what we can say to Rathnavelu's work) -Music & background score are just the soul of the movie (DSP can just break his own records) -Art work (Is it sets in the movie ? Not even felt that for a second too..Great work Team).",genuine story with lot reality perfectly made movie,what movie just blown away with this kind story sukumar wrote spell bound performance by ram charan chitti babu like never before he became like clay hands sukumar there is just chitti babu seen through out movie this will be his landmark movie we get see all shades character be it equally strong mentally physically emotional being funny romantic family guy responsible guy comical most innocent most caring there is so much say about charan as chitti babu ram charan deserves national award truly getting into skin chitti babu samantha rama lakshmi chitti babu is incomplete without rama lakshmi she is amazing cannot imagine any other except samantha she just breaks her own acting records with incredible performance every movie she just stands tall surpasses everyone with her incredible work rama lakshmi is very strong character with added cuteness samantha sunk into it perfectly jagapathi babu president is excels his role terrifically portrayed he can just act with his eyes experience matters lot pull such act adi pinisetty kumar babu prakash raj dakshina murthy anasuya rangamatha are so apt their role they added lot value story line every character movie has their importance no character is just standing there as prop highlights movie point characters sketch screen play cinematography just wow is what we can say rathnavelus work music background score are just soul movie dsp can just break his own records art work is it sets movie not even felt that second too great work team,0.7041358024691358,0.4304320987654321,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"
