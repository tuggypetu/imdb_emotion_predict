8.0,A classy movie!,"UPO is a well made movie in all aspects. It was very nice to see the two big stars cum actors of India, Kamal & Mohanlal share the screen. Kamal is so good in the last few scenes of the movie and Mohanlal has done his part with ease. Enjoyable movie with strong message. I feel that with big stars, message can reach broader audience and Kamal has exactly done that with the movie.Dialogues and background score of the movie really need a mention. Era.Murukan as a dialogue writer and Shruthi Haasan as music director and both being a debutant have done a good job. It's tough to cope with the expectations set and no one would dare to remake such a critically acclaimed movie like 'A Wednesday', only Kamal will. Hats off!",classy movie,upo is well made movie all aspects it was very nice see two big stars cum actors india kamal mohanlal share screen kamal is so good last few scenes movie mohanlal has done his part with ease enjoyable movie with strong message i feel that with big stars message can reach broader audience kamal has exactly done that with movie dialogues background score movie really need mention era murukan as dialogue writer shruthi haasan as music director both being debutant have done good job its tough cope with expectations set no one would dare remake such critically acclaimed movie like wednesday only kamal will hats off,0.5239583333333333,0.1921527777777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.44}"

10.0,Oh My God!!1...absolutely thrilling!!!!,"Kamal Hassan's Chakri-Toleti directed Unnaipol Oruvan is new age Tamil cinema, which we can say proudly, is a must-watch. What elevates the film to a new high is the crisp presentation and outstanding performances from the lead actors, mainly Kamal and Mohanlal, who simply rock. The film is on par with the original Neeraj Pandey's A Wednesday, with minor modifications to make it politically correct by including a Hindu mercenary, a gun runner for whom it is just about money.The dialogues written by Era Murugan are electrifying and justifies the milieu change from the terror-prone Mumbai to much calmer climes of Chennai.Kamal Hassan and his team have also pointed to the Coimbatore bomb blast and Meenambakkam airport blast to give the film a local flavour. And to add his own secularist view point, one of the Muslim characters justifies his action and says it is all because of Modi and communal politics which led to the Best Bakery case. The film is well intended and is told in an emphatic manner very bravely.One ordinary day, the Chennai city police commissioner Raghava Maraar (Mohanlal) receives a threatening call on his mobile from a guy (Kamal Hassan), who claims that he has placed five bombs in various parts of the city. The veracity of the caller's claim is confirmed when the cops find a bag with a RDX bomb at the Anna Salai police station.The anonymous caller wants five hard core terrorists to be freed -- If not, he threatens blasts at various locations in Chennai where he has concealed the bombs. The chief secretary (Lakshmi) on the orders of Chief Minister has given a Maraar a free hand. Maraar and his crack team of officers, led by a daring brooding cop Arif Khan (Ganesh Venkatram), gets ready to hand over the terrorists to the anonymous caller at an airfield. The story cannot be told further as it would be a giveaway of the stunning and well written climax, which had the entire audiences in the theatre giving a standing ovation at the end. It is a very brave and pathbreaking film, with a running time of only 110 minutes.The film works because of its ensemble cast and the outstanding performances of Mohanlal and Kamal Hassan. Unlike in the Hindi version where Naseeruddin Shah had an edge over Anupam Kher, here the best dialogues in the film and almost equal screen time is given to Mohanlal.Kamal's emotional outburst at the end, is heart rending and perhaps one of the finest piece of acting seen in Tamil cinema. Kamal and Mohanlal coming together is worth your ticket money. Ganesh Venkatram has a tailor-made role, and this film is going to be his big ticket to stardom.Technically the film is picture perfect, with great background score by Sruthi Hassan, that builds the mood.Chakri Toleti as a director cannot make a better debut as director in a film that will bring about a change in Tamil commercial cinema. Go for it and encourage good meaningful cinema.",oh my god 1 absolutely thrilling,kamal hassans chakri toleti directed unnaipol oruvan is new age tamil cinema which we can say proudly is must watch what elevates film new high is crisp presentation outstanding performances lead actors mainly kamal mohanlal who simply rock film is par with original neeraj pandeys wednesday with minor modifications make it politically correct by including hindu mercenary gun runner whom it is just about money dialogues written by era murugan are electrifying justifies milieu change terror prone mumbai much calmer climes chennai kamal hassan his team have also pointed coimbatore bomb blast meenambakkam airport blast give film local flavour add his own secularist view point one muslim characters justifies his action says it is all because modi communal politics which led best bakery case film is well intended is told emphatic manner very bravely one ordinary day chennai city police commissioner raghava maraar mohanlal receives threatening call his mobile guy kamal hassan who claims that he has placed five bombs various parts city veracity callers claim is confirmed when cops find bag with rdx bomb at anna salai police station anonymous caller wants five hard core terrorists be freed if not he threatens blasts at various locations chennai where he has concealed bombs chief secretary lakshmi orders chief minister has given maraar free hand maraar his crack team officers led by daring brooding cop arif khan ganesh venkatram gets ready hand over terrorists anonymous caller at airfield story cannot be told further as it would be giveaway stunning well written climax which had entire audiences theatre giving standing ovation at end it is very brave pathbreaking film with running time only 110 minutes film works because its ensemble cast outstanding performances mohanlal kamal hassan unlike hindi version where naseeruddin shah had edge over anupam kher here best dialogues film almost equal screen time is given mohanlal kamals emotional outburst at end is heart rending perhaps one finest piece acting seen tamil cinema kamal mohanlal coming together is worth your ticket money ganesh venkatram has tailor made role this film is going be his big ticket stardom technically film is picture perfect with great background score by sruthi hassan that builds mood chakri toleti as director cannot make better debut as director film that will bring about change tamil commercial cinema go it encourage good meaningful cinema,0.5193977873977875,0.2907272727272728,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10.0,Unnai Pol Oruvan: A Retrospective,"Very rarely does a Tamil movie make me sit up straight and gaze in awe at the big screen. When the actors live the characters and the technical aspects do not stand out, but, rather support the screenplay which moves with such an incredible pace as it happened in UPO, I knew I had witnessed a milestone in Tamil Cinema. And, if we, the Tamil Cinema audience (who appreciate quality movies) have mainly one man to thank for, it is none other than the one who celebrates his golden year in the film industry, Mr. Kamal Haasan.This is neither a movie review nor an appreciatory message on Mr. Haasan, but my thoughts on the movie and a few issues that seem to crop up in some of the reviews for UPO.Kamal as a ""Common Man"": some people find it hard to differentiate Kamal Haasan the movie star and Kamal Haasan the versatile actor. If you understand Kamal Haasan as an actor, you should be prepared to get whatever he throws at you. There have been so many characters from ""Kalyana Raman"" to ""Dasavatharam"", where he has portrayed a range of characters in all walks of life. If you had taken that in mind into the movie theatre, you may not have been imbued with his ""star value"". I deliberately wrote that within quotes, because I believe (my opinion) the great characters we have witnessed on-screen were rather common men (in movie terms, character actors) than leading men. One of the greatest Hollywood examples would be ""Travis Bickle"" played by Robert De Niro in the ""Taxi Driver (1976)"". Travis as Kamal Haasan's character in UPO has his own sense of justice. He metes out justice as he sees fit.Kamal's Viewpoint of Terrorism: it is best that we do not assume that the ""Common Man's"" viewpoint of terrorism in UPO is that of Kamal Haasan. Would we as the good people of this earth, want ""instant justice"" like ""2-minute-noodles""? It would not be surprising to see many people divided over this issue. We have seen many movies where the protagonists fight the evil almost single-handedly and save the damsel in distress at the end of the day and ride into the sunset. Is the ""Common Man"" in UPO a protagonist? Has he triumphed over evil at the end of the day? I believe the answer to both questions to be a firm ""NO"". The common man walks the fine line between the good and the bad (as we the good people like to call the ""necessary evil""). As a common man he has seen the governments play games with each other (clue: the TV program ""Mush & Bush"") and red tapes all over when the situation could have been solved instantly. So, the ""Common Man"" of UPO proceeds to decide the fate of the terrorists.Kamal & Secularism: why was one of the terrorists a Hindu? Is this Kamal again forcing his secularist issues on the audience? Was Kamal trying to play it safe? I believe not. When Naseeruddin Shah played the ""Common Man"" in ""A Wednesday"", the audience watched the movie theatres with an instilled sense of justice as Naseeruddin Shah is by nature, a Muslim. Unfortunately there are people, who would see Kamal Haasan (by birth a Hindu and now an atheist who orchestrates to kill Muslim terrorists), and will call him politically incorrect and burn his effigy.Unnaipol Oruvan works as an ""engrossing thriller"" a clichéd review would say, but as far as I am concerned, Kamal Haasan has yet again lashed out against the mundane and ignorant existence of the common men. Especially his monologue scene as tears flow from his eyes, we watch like most people who are unable to do anything lest we speak out. How much more of evil must we face before we are pushed over the edge?",unnai pol oruvan retrospective,very rarely does tamil movie make me sit up straight gaze awe at big screen when actors live characters technical aspects do not stand out but rather support screenplay which moves with such incredible pace as it happened upo i knew i had witnessed milestone tamil cinema if we tamil cinema audience who appreciate quality movies have mainly one man thank it is none other than one who celebrates his golden year film industry mr kamal haasan this is neither movie review nor appreciatory message mr haasan but my thoughts movie few issues that seem crop up some reviews upo kamal as common man some people find it hard differentiate kamal haasan movie star kamal haasan versatile actor if you understand kamal haasan as actor you should be prepared get whatever he throws at you there have been so many characters kalyana raman dasavatharam where he has portrayed range characters all walks life if you had taken that mind into movie theatre you may not have been imbued with his star value i deliberately wrote that within quotes because i believe my opinion great characters we have witnessed screen were rather common men movie terms character actors than leading men one greatest hollywood examples would be travis bickle played by robert de niro taxi driver 1976 travis as kamal haasans character upo has his own sense justice he metes out justice as he sees fit kamals viewpoint terrorism it is best that we do not assume that common mans viewpoint terrorism upo is that kamal haasan would we as good people this earth want instant justice like 2 minute noodles it would not be surprising see many people divided over this issue we have seen many movies where protagonists fight evil almost single handedly save damsel distress at end day ride into sunset is common man upo protagonist has he triumphed over evil at end day i believe answer both questions be firm no common man walks fine line between good bad as we good people like call necessary evil as common man he has seen governments play games with each other clue tv program mush bush red tapes all over when situation could have been solved instantly so common man upo proceeds decide fate terrorists kamal secularism why was one terrorists hindu is this kamal again forcing his secularist issues audience was kamal trying play it safe i believe not when naseeruddin shah played common man wednesday audience watched movie theatres with instilled sense justice as naseeruddin shah is by nature muslim unfortunately there are people who would see kamal haasan by birth hindu now atheist who orchestrates kill muslim terrorists will call him politically incorrect burn his effigy unnaipol oruvan works as engrossing thriller clich d review would say but as far as i am concerned kamal haasan has yet again lashed out against mundane ignorant existence common men especially his monologue scene as tears flow his eyes we watch like most people who are unable do anything lest we speak out how much more evil must we face before we are pushed over edge,0.5616233766233767,0.06690791027154666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.56}"

,Not wholly Disappointing,"Not all remakes can aspire to reach the heights of 'The Departed'. So they should never be attempted. Kamal has always been fond of re-interpreting successful Hindi movie works. In my opinion, Kuruthipoonal was the one that was done the best, though it didn't get full marks for subtlety. This one, however, scores high on subtlety, esp. considering both the lead performances. I was only disappointed that they did not try to re-invent the movie, but just chose to make an almost exact replica. However, for those that did not watch A Wednesday, since it was more of a multiplex success, this is a good opportunity to sample something different from the run-of-the-mill fare (though Tamil cinema of late has fewer of those than Telugu, which is still ruled by the grandiose 'seema' style of movie plotting, or the 'Bommarrillu' fare).",not wholly disappointing,not all remakes can aspire reach heights departed so they should never be attempted kamal has always been fond re interpreting successful hindi movie works my opinion kuruthipoonal was one that was done best though it didnt get full marks subtlety this one however scores high subtlety esp considering both lead performances i was only disappointed that they did not try re invent movie but just chose make almost exact replica however those that did not watch wednesday since it was more multiplex success this is good opportunity sample something different run mill fare though tamil cinema late has fewer those than telugu which is still ruled by grandiose seema style movie plotting or bommarrillu fare,0.5646153846153846,0.18153846153846157,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.45, 'Fear': 0.18}"
8.0,One Of The Best Tamil Films Ever Made,"Amazing acting for starters. For once I think they've reached almost international standards, the tension was awesome, there weren't any songs (the usual in Tamil movies) which was a pleasant surprise. Amazing acting again and the English when used (esp by Kamal) sounded like English for a change. India was portrayed well for a change as well, no rogues at every corner, well-dressed and neat police officers (and yes they were the good guys for a change). The places were clean, the shots were realistic and it was a good movie even in International standards. Even the Tamil was well spoken. I would recommend this to those who are learning Tamil, entertaining and good language used and as an example to future Tamil Film Makers. Make films like these and you'll attract the young, professional (non rowdy) crowd.P.S. Kamal should consider starring in some Hollywood Blockbusters!

10.0,A Remake made to make audience rethink!,"First off let me tell you, I have seen all three versions of 'A Wednesday' - A Wednesday in Hindi, Unnai Pol Oruvan(UPO) in Tamil and Eenadu in Telugu and I have a few interesting things to share. This review might contain spoilers and therefore please skip my review if you haven't yet seen this movie.In UPO, they show one of the four terrorists as a hindu and he admits that he supplies arms, bombs and weapons to terrorists for sake of money alone. The other three are shown as in Wednesday. Anupam Kher's performance as the commissioner is a notch better than Mohanlal's portrayal but Venkatesh's version beats both. Kamal's come out with a brilliant performance and even his body language while he climbs the stairs and picks up the fallen tomatoes look so naturally 'uncinematic' and so real.Mohanlal acts as if he knows whats going to come in the next scene which is a big disappointment but at least he does not falter in dialogue delivery and his thick accent probably is needed to justify that he is very vulnerable to insubordination and lack of cooperation thereof among peers in the judicial setup like the chief secretary of the CM for instance. So one can personally interpret that he was living in dangerous waters dealing with other big names even though Tamil is not his mother tongue. So there is no need for audience to understand how he would have been stripped off his duty. (Atleast seeing his character I did not feel curious as why such an able officer was sacked. For he looked very vulnerable for that position with his accent. But not in the case with Venkatesh in eenadu) In Telugu version(Eenadu), they rather show a bit more confrontation between Lakshmi and Venkatesh to make it look like he was terminated of his service as a result of his misuse of power and authority alone. And that made me wonder how such an efficient officer is sacked. Kamal's casting of Venkatesh was a good one but Mohanlal should have done a bit of more home work. Especially the scenes where he is made to react to the phone call - Venkatesh makes it look like he is left in the blue to figure it out himself and gives the impression he actually is facing the situation while Mohanlal looked like he knows the story and whats going to happen next. But that apart, Eenadu is the better version between the three and although I do not understand much of Telugu, still the acting was exceptional by all. UPO is good for its dialogue delivery and Kamal & Ganesh Venkatraman's performance alone. But full marks for this path breaking theme of songless, glamorless, comedy less, single-costume affair that it is going to inspire more and more movies of this genre in the future. Already the movie has had a fairly decent opening to add to the success story of this project. Raj Kamal international and UTV's production values have been excellent and is a 100% value for your money. Shruthi's music, Era Murugan's screenplay and dialogue, the cinematography of the movie (using the Red One camera for an entire movie for the first time in Indian cinema) and the acting, it is a 5/5 rating movie.",remake made make audience rethink,first off let me tell you i have seen all three versions wednesday wednesday hindi unnai pol oruvan upo tamil eenadu telugu i have few interesting things share this review might contain spoilers therefore please skip my review if you havent yet seen this movie upo they show one four terrorists as hindu he admits that he supplies arms bombs weapons terrorists sake money alone other three are shown as wednesday anupam khers performance as commissioner is notch better than mohanlals portrayal but venkateshs version beats both kamals come out with brilliant performance even his body language while he climbs stairs picks up fallen tomatoes look so naturally uncinematic so real mohanlal acts as if he knows whats going come next scene which is big disappointment but at least he does not falter dialogue delivery his thick accent probably is needed justify that he is very vulnerable insubordination lack cooperation thereof among peers judicial setup like chief secretary cm instance so one can personally interpret that he was living dangerous waters dealing with other big names even though tamil is not his mother tongue so there is no need audience understand how he would have been stripped off his duty atleast seeing his character i did not feel curious as why such able officer was sacked he looked very vulnerable that position with his accent but not case with venkatesh eenadu telugu version eenadu they rather show bit more confrontation between lakshmi venkatesh make it look like he was terminated his service as result his misuse power authority alone that made me wonder how such efficient officer is sacked kamals casting venkatesh was good one but mohanlal should have done bit more home work especially scenes where he is made react phone call venkatesh makes it look like he is left blue figure it out himself gives impression he actually is facing situation while mohanlal looked like he knows story whats going happen next but that apart eenadu is better version between three although i do not understand much telugu still acting was exceptional by all upo is good its dialogue delivery kamal ganesh venkatramans performance alone but full marks this path breaking theme songless glamorless comedy less single costume affair that it is going inspire more more movies this genre future already movie has had fairly decent opening add success story this project raj kamal international utvs production values have been excellent is 100 value your money shruthis music era murugans screenplay dialogue cinematography movie using red one camera entire movie first time indian cinema acting it is 5 5 rating movie,0.4032857142857143,0.11790476190476191,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.28}"
4.0,Poor Remake,"With a Stellar star cast, they have managed to churn out a mediocre remake. At least if they had stuck to the original script, they would have done justice to movie. A half hearted attempt at showing some originality. Kamal of Dashavataram and Anbe-Sivam, associating with this kind of production quality is not acceptable. Some of Kamal's earlier Hindi remakes like Kurudipunal, were actually better than the original. I have watched ""A Wednesday"" more than 5 times, while it was so hard to see this even once. Lakhsmi's acting is also a great let down, and the raw anger in Arif character was excellently portrayed by ""jimmy Shergil"" could not be matched in this movie. Mohanlal was a bad choice for the commissioner role, I was actually expecting Nasser in that role.
