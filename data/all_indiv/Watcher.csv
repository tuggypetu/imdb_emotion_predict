7.0,Nervy take on a well-worn concept,"""Watcher"" follows Julia, an American who moves to Bucharest with her husband, Francis. While Francis is fluent in the language--his mother is Romanian--Julia is not, and struggles with the language barrier. Even worse, she also finds herself being watched by a man in the adjacent apartment building, and comes to believe that not only is he stalking her, but that he is a serial killer.It goes without saying that ""Watcher"" is playing with a familiar concept--this is a premise we have seen in a large number of films, most famously in Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" but ""Watcher"" also pays respects to Roman Polanski's ""apartment"" films, most notably (and effectively) ""The Tenant"" (the other two being ""Rosemary' Baby"" and ""Repulsion""). What makes it stand out, however, is that it is well-acted, visually elegant, and at times throttling in its suspense. There are a number of scenes in this film that (no pun intended) grab you by the throat.""Watcher"" is the breed of film that toes the line regarding whether or not the fears and paranoias of the protagonist are legitimate, or the product of something else, but director Chloe Okuno telegraphs it intelligently by positioning the audience in tandem with Julia--as we watch her sink into her isolation, we are isolated alongside her--and it is because of this that her fears play out as believable, despite her husband's skepticism. The writing here is both subtle and smart, and there are a few key moments that are as dislocating to the viewer as they are to the protagonist; the screenplay is multi-pronged in a way that makes the audience question not what they are seeing, but rather, what it is indicative of. Julia's disconnect from the language only helps to reinforce a sense of suffocation, and the gloomy, rain-soaked Art Deco architecture of the city only amplifies the sense of unease.Of course, none of this would work without a believable lead, and Maika Monroe plays this character very effectively. Burn Gorman is also extremely effective as the mysterious creep across the way. The film's finale, though tense, is still fairly downbeat (which is the status quo in this film), but it offers enough grand guignol to be memorable and shocking. In the end, while ""Watcher"" is not necessarily revelatory, it is a well-crafted, nervy take on a well-worn concept. There are some standout moments in this film that make it worth watching for any genre fan. 7/10.",nervy take well worn concept,watcher follows julia american who moves bucharest with her husband francis while francis is fluent language his mother is romanian julia is not struggles with language barrier even worse she also finds herself being watched by man adjacent apartment building comes believe that not only is he stalking her but that he is serial killer it goes without saying that watcher is playing with familiar concept this is premise we have seen large number films most famously hitchcocks rear window but watcher also pays respects roman polanskis apartment films most notably effectively tenant other two being rosemary baby repulsion what makes it stand out however is that it is well acted visually elegant at times throttling its suspense there are number scenes this film that no pun intended grab you by throat watcher is breed film that toes line regarding whether or not fears paranoias protagonist are legitimate or product something else but director chloe okuno telegraphs it intelligently by positioning audience tandem with julia as we watch her sink into her isolation we are isolated alongside her it is because this that her fears play out as believable despite her husbands skepticism writing here is both subtle smart there are few key moments that are as dislocating viewer as they are protagonist screenplay is multi pronged way that makes audience question not what they are seeing but rather what it is indicative julias disconnect language only helps reinforce sense suffocation gloomy rain soaked art deco architecture city only amplifies sense unease course none this would work without believable lead maika monroe plays this character very effectively burn gorman is also extremely effective as mysterious creep across way films finale though tense is still fairly downbeat which is status quo this film but it offers enough grand guignol be memorable shocking end while watcher is not necessarily revelatory it is well crafted nervy take well worn concept there are some standout moments this film that make it worth watching any genre fan 7 10,0.6764508928571429,0.19662202380952382,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
6.0,Hints Of Rear Window,"I saw Watcher, starring Maika Monroe-Independence Day:Resurgence, It Follows; Karl Glusman-Nocturnal Animals, The Neon Demon and Burn Gorman-the Pacific Rim movies, Game of Thrones_tv.This is a thriller that has hints of Rear Window. Maika and Karl are a married couple that move to Bucharest-where Karl is from-for Karls' job. They get an apartment and while Karl is working all day, Maika spends time shopping or looking out her window. She notices Burn-across the street from their apartment-seems to be watching her. She goes to the movies or the grocery store and he follows her. He never makes contact with her but just follows her. Maika and Karl hear about a serial killer that is attacking women in the area-decapitating them-and Maika jumps to the conclusion that it is Burn. Is it him? Or is she just being paranoid or imagining it? That's what everyone keeps telling her. To be honest, she does do some dumb things, like following Burn-alone-into buildings instead of calling for someone to go with her. The ending is pretty predictable, too.It's rated R for bloody violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour& 31 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",hints rear window,i saw watcher starring maika monroe independence day resurgence it follows karl glusman nocturnal animals neon demon burn gorman pacific rim movies game thrones tv this is thriller that has hints rear window maika karl are married couple that move bucharest where karl is karls job they get apartment while karl is working all day maika spends time shopping or looking out her window she notices burn across street their apartment seems be watching her she goes movies or grocery store he follows her he never makes contact with her but just follows her maika karl hear about serial killer that is attacking women area decapitating them maika jumps conclusion that it is burn is it him or is she just being paranoid or imagining it thats what everyone keeps telling her be honest she does do some dumb things like following burn alone into buildings instead calling someone go with her ending is pretty predictable too its rated r bloody violence language sexual content including nudity has running time 1 hour 31 minutes its not one that i would buy dvd but it would be alright as rental,0.5981481481481481,-0.019444444444444448,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.37}"
3.0,Ugh,"This movie starts off so slow, taking forever before anything interesting or intriguing happens. Then when it finally does, we get our first dose of many idiotic decisions that make it difficult to care for the character. We see more annoying tropes and very little payoff in this slog of a movie. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 6/2/2022)SPOILERSWas anyone else annoyed by the extensive amount of dialogue in Romanian without subtitles? I understand they are trying to make us feel as isolated as the character feels, but it's aggravating.When the first ""scary"" moment happens in the grocery store, I'm thinking she's perfectly safe here in the open with people around. But she decides to go into a poorly lit backroom with no one around. And even after knowing there is a serial killer on the loose, she repeatedly walks alone down a dark alley. I know they are trying to build tension, but you can't do that at the expense of the character's credibility.Then we get a HEAVY dose of one of the most annoying tropes in thrillers and especially in horror: the boyfriend/husband doesn't believe her. He starts off seeming very supportive, to the point where he suggests going to look at the footage from the grocery store. But he throws her under the bus and claims she's the one staring at him, when we haven't seen anything to warrant this conclusion.He spends the rest of the movie being the worst husband ever. By the time we reach the climax, I cared so little about the lead character (I can't even remember her name) and hated the husband so much that I really wanted her to die just so he feels like a piece of garbage. I don't think that was the intention of these filmmakers.The ending is laughable. I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure slicing the carotid artery doesn't prevent you from breathing or screaming. Then she crawls towards the gun and plays dead. Once he leaves she gets the gun and shoots him. But why would she play dead in the first place? She could have easily reached the gun before that. What if he stabbed her more or cut off her head?And apparently he didn't slice the carotid artery, otherwise she would be dead in minutes. Apparently he sliced a different artery that gushes large amounts of blood but doesn't kill you. Give me a break, movie.",ugh,this movie starts off so slow taking forever before anything interesting or intriguing happens then when it finally does we get our first dose many idiotic decisions that make it difficult care character we see more annoying tropes very little payoff this slog movie 1 viewing opening thursday 6 2 2022 spoilerswas anyone else annoyed by extensive amount dialogue romanian without subtitles i understand they are trying make us feel as isolated as character feels but its aggravating when first scary moment happens grocery store im thinking shes perfectly safe here open with people around but she decides go into poorly lit backroom with no one around even after knowing there is serial killer loose she repeatedly walks alone down dark alley i know they are trying build tension but you cant do that at expense characters credibility then we get heavy dose one most annoying tropes thrillers especially horror boyfriend husband doesnt believe her he starts off seeming very supportive point where he suggests going look at footage grocery store but he throws her under bus claims shes one staring at him when we havent seen anything warrant this conclusion he spends rest movie being worst husband ever by time we reach climax i cared so little about lead character i cant even remember her name hated husband so much that i really wanted her die just so he feels like piece garbage i dont think that was intention these filmmakers ending is laughable im no doctor but im pretty sure slicing carotid artery doesnt prevent you breathing or screaming then she crawls towards gun plays dead once he leaves she gets gun shoots him but why would she play dead first place she could have easily reached gun before that what if he stabbed her more or cut off her head apparently he didnt slice carotid artery otherwise she would be dead minutes apparently he sliced different artery that gushes large amounts blood but doesnt kill you give me break movie,0.591490453990454,-0.04051764208014207,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.5}"

9.0,"Not flashy. Purely, and compellingly, psychological.","By merit of concept alone, there really isn't anything new here. It's the writing and character work that causes Watcher to soar above standard thriller genre fare.First-rate performances are given by the entire cast. They all embody their characters with humanity and make them instantly unique and often sympathetic.Julia is a woman who has moved with her husband to a country where she does not know the language and has no personal connections. Her sense of loneliness is made palpable very early on and it makes the unease she feels extremely understandable as she becomes more and more convinced that she has a stalker.This screenplay is astoundingly good. Each scene is written so carefully so as to ensure that both doubt and faith in Julia's perspective is built to equal degrees. The lack of clarity starts to drive a wedge through her marriage, and it's heartbreaking to watch.

8.0,Stranger In a Strange Land. What's Real and What Isn't?,"For a majority of this film's running time, it was cruising along at about a 6 rating for me, based on the fine performances by all, and the cool Romanian atmosphere. For me, also during this time, the film seemed more of a psychological drama than a thriller. It was not scary or even really suspenseful. It just gave more questions than answers during this time. What it lacks on the front end in chills, it makes up for in mood and beauty. The actresses are pretty here and the Bucharest setting provides its own unique attractiveness.Many might say this movie a slow burn. It is not. It plods along, but only somewhat, and not necessarily in a bad way.The ending. The last ten minutes or so. This is where the rating gets ratcheted up to an 8.You've been gently led along, and then, POW!! Here's the ending! The true finale. You've been thinking to yourself, so this is it, this is the way it's going to be, okay, I guess I can believe that, and the ending punches you right in the face.

7.0,cat and mouse,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's tough being the new kid. Moving to a new city with no friends is always a challenge. That's especially true for a grown-up when the new city is in a country where you don't speak the language - and you gave up your career to support your spouse who got a promotion to his home country. The first feature film from writer-director Chloe Okuno and co-writer Zack Ford is a bit of a throwback thriller that reminded me of some of Brian DePalma's work in the 1970's and 1980's, while also recalling other genre films.Maika Monroe (IT FOLLOWS, 2014) stars as Julia, wife of Francis (Karl Glusman, LOVE, 2015). Their new apartment has a large picture window that overlooks the run-down tenement located across the street. Julia immediately notices the shadowed figure of a man who appears to be watching her. Yes, the set-up reminds us of Hitchcock's classic REAR WINDOW, though this one heads off in a different direction. The pressures of Francis' new job keep him working long hours, which means Julia is left alone a great deal of the time. As a former actor, now 're-evaluating' her career path, Julia spends the days walking the local streets and listening to language tapes. See, their new place is in Bucharest, Romania, and the language gap plays a huge role in casting her as an outsider in all social interactions.But wait, there's more! Local news reports detail a serial killer nicknamed ""Spider"" has been murdering and beheading women. So when Julia begins seeing that shadowy figure from the window everywhere she goes, she assumes he's following/stalking her. Is he the serial killer? Perhaps the question is, who is the cat and who is the mouse? While making the point that the film so desperately wants to make, it does so in the least believable manner. Husband Francis dismisses her paranoia as that of a lonely woman - a reaction that seems absurd given the presence of a serial killer (Grace Kelly believed Jimmy Stewart!). Fortunately, filmmaker Okuno and the performance of Ms. Monroe prevent this from becoming an eye-roller for viewers.As Julia and the ""watcher"" (played with a creepy stoicism by Burn Gorman, CRIMSON PEAK, 2015) continue to cross paths, Francis asks, ""Is he watching you, or is he watching the person who is watching him?"" It's this attitude that every woman will recognize ... being accused of having it be ""all in her head"", and having concerns minimized by men (spouses, cops, doctors, etc). Ms. Monroe gives a subdued, quiet performance that works terrifically in this setting. She kind of glows on screen and excels at conveying the feeling of isolation that Julia experiences, some of it enhanced by her husband's approach.There are a couple of terrific scenes featuring Julia and her neighbor Irina (Madalina Anea), a single woman who understands Julia's trepidation. Other excellent scenes include Julia going solo to the movie theater to watch CHARADE, a film from which Okuno obviously draws inspiration; and best of all, a scene on the train where Julia and the watcher come face to face and have one of the more uncomfortable conversations (with a wonderful prop) we'll likely ever see on screen. Both actors are superb here.The cinematography of Benjamin Kirk Nielsen and the score from Nathan Halpern perfectly correspond to the slow-burn pacing that lacks the typical 'jump-scares' that have become commonplace in thrillers. Despite some 'iffy' dialogue, the film is effective in isolating Julia and presenting the fear that women live with, while often having their feelings minimized. A strong ending sets up Chloe Okuno as a filmmaker to watch.In theaters June 3, 2022 and On Demand June 21, 2022.",cat mouse,greetings again darkness its tough being new kid moving new city with no friends is always challenge thats especially true grown up when new city is country where you dont speak language you gave up your career support your spouse who got promotion his home country first feature film writer director chloe okuno co writer zack ford is bit throwback thriller that reminded me some brian depalmas work 1970s 1980s while also recalling other genre films maika monroe it follows 2014 stars as julia wife francis karl glusman love 2015 their new apartment has large picture window that overlooks run down tenement located across street julia immediately notices shadowed figure man who appears be watching her yes set up reminds us hitchcocks classic rear window though this one heads off different direction pressures francis new job keep him working long hours which means julia is left alone great deal time as former actor now re evaluating her career path julia spends days walking local streets listening language tapes see their new place is bucharest romania language gap plays huge role casting her as outsider all social interactions but wait theres more local news reports detail serial killer nicknamed spider has been murdering beheading women so when julia begins seeing that shadowy figure window everywhere she goes she assumes hes following stalking her is he serial killer perhaps question is who is cat who is mouse while making point that film so desperately wants make it does so least believable manner husband francis dismisses her paranoia as that lonely woman reaction that seems absurd given presence serial killer grace kelly believed jimmy stewart fortunately filmmaker okuno performance ms monroe prevent this becoming eye roller viewers as julia watcher played with creepy stoicism by burn gorman crimson peak 2015 continue cross paths francis asks is he watching you or is he watching person who is watching him its this attitude that every woman will recognize being accused having it be all her head having concerns minimized by men spouses cops doctors etc ms monroe gives subdued quiet performance that works terrifically this setting she kind glows screen excels at conveying feeling isolation that julia experiences some it enhanced by her husbands approach there are couple terrific scenes featuring julia her neighbor irina madalina anea single woman who understands julias trepidation other excellent scenes include julia going solo movie theater watch charade film which okuno obviously draws inspiration best all scene train where julia watcher come face face have one more uncomfortable conversations with wonderful prop well likely ever see screen both actors are superb here cinematography benjamin kirk nielsen score nathan halpern perfectly correspond slow burn pacing that lacks typical jump scares that have become commonplace thrillers despite some iffy dialogue film is effective isolating julia presenting fear that women live with while often having their feelings minimized strong ending sets up chloe okuno as filmmaker watch theaters june 3 2022 demand june 21 2022,0.5353902910506684,0.1871627324457513,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"

,Thriller formula with sophistication and Hitchcock.,"Let's say you're thinking about writing a thriller for the screen. Naturally you'll first consult Alfred Hitchcock, who can be counted on to employ all the tropes and add a few of his originals to strengthen the tension, like the MacGuffin.Your updated paradigm is in your theaters now: Watcher. Set in Bucharest, it employs as many formulaic elements as possible in its 91 minutes, e.g., a simple one: the gun that first appears early on and then later on. More as I attend to themes and character arcs.Julia (Maika Monroe) is an attractive blonde (think The Birds or Psycho) accompanying her husband, Francis (Karl Glusman), to Romania for his new job, won because he knows the language. She not knowing it, and he speaking it with colleagues in front of her when they know English, is an isolating touch for a lady who is lonely from her arrival. The indolent wife in these thrillers can be vulnerable with nothing to do but wander the streets.Early on she believes a man is watching her from a window across the way (think Rear Window)and following her when she is out and about. As in so many thrillers, no one believes her, and writer/director Chloe Okuno does a smooth job setting the audience to disbelief as well. Not that this weak spot for a heroine is so unusual-think of the number of candidates like Condoleezza Rice and Amber Heard. (Nevertheless, Julia's loneliness could have been remedied by having her work but then no thriller)The plot runs apace as Julia makes a friend, Ellen, who lives alone and is equally vulnerable. Possible stalkers appear while Julia becomes more paranoid with each encounter, until . . . . Well, I won't tell.Yes, there's a bird's eye shot at the head of the stairs (think Vertigo) and a MacGuffin in the form of a serial killer who may or may not be Julia's watcher.

7.0,Modernized Hitchcock done right,"This was a fantastic paranoia thriller. Maika Moore is fantastic as the lead actress and the villian was also perfectly cast, he was quite menacing. The story here is very well done, albeit derivitive and at times you must suspend some levels of your disbelief, but it provides just enough twists and turns throughout to keep it from getting stale. With that said, the movie can also be kind of slow in parts, but I feel like it was a slow burn done right. Hitchcock would be proud of this film. The ending does it right, however I would've enjoyed an extra five minutes just to know what ended up with these characters, but I think I got the jist of it, so I digress. If you're looking for a good paranoia horror/thriller, this would be a great choice and you could definitely do worse. I recommend to people who enjoy a go slow burn that leads up to creepy conclusion. 3.5 creepy creepertons out of.",modernized hitchcock done right,this was fantastic paranoia thriller maika moore is fantastic as lead actress villian was also perfectly cast he was quite menacing story here is very well done albeit derivitive at times you must suspend some levels your disbelief but it provides just enough twists turns throughout keep it getting stale with that said movie can also be kind slow parts but i feel like it was slow burn done right hitchcock would be proud this film ending does it right however i wouldve enjoyed extra five minutes just know what ended up with these characters but i think i got jist it so i digress if youre looking good paranoia horror thriller this would be great choice you could definitely do worse i recommend people who enjoy go slow burn that leads up creepy conclusion 3 5 creepy creepertons out,0.6546583850931676,0.12422360248447203,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.48}"
8.0,This film documents how any American is totally bonkers . . .,". . . if they set foot in a foreign country, such as the Balkan Blunder-Land of Romania. Taking place in a Bucharest in which every other resident looks like a decapitating serial killer, WATCHER proves that leaving the friendly confines of our U. S. Homeland is a fatal mistake often impossible to correct. An extended stay in Romania is almost as bad as a week in Canada, main character Julia soon learns. At least in America, we all know that serial killers belong exclusively to the murderous Pachyderm Political Party, starting with rising star Ted B-u-n-d-y. When Watergate derailed his hero ""Tricky Dope"" Nixon in 1974, Ted went berserk, fatally bludgeoning every helpful bleeding heart Democratic normal gal he could trick into his foreign murder-mobile. After legalizing all manner of Russian-like military-style assault weapons, the Pachyderms are well on their way to eradicating authentic freedom-loving actual human beings from the U. S.

3.0,Profoundly uninteresting,"This movie takes an interesting concept and drags it down to boring, run-of-the-mill 'thriller'I understand the praise for the lead, but it seemed incredibly heavy-handed to me, as if she was acting on stage.Poorly written, says nothing of importance. (They had a golden chance of saying ANYTHING about feminism and sexism in today's society and refused)I love the idea of the lead being so isolated that she doesn't even understand the language around her. However, it seems that at every turn, she acts incredibly irrationality, regardless of her surroundings.Also, the viewer never has any chance to THINK. The film hand-feeds the plot with no chance of introspection or critical thinking.Let's not even talk of the husband following the cliché of unbelieving to a point of absurdity.Frustratingly boring and predictable ending as well (Chekov's gun anyone???)Overall, I'd say 3/10 is incredibly generous, however the setting (even though the director decides to add no Romanian influence other than spoken language the the film to a point where this episode could happen literally ANYWHERE) is interesting as well as the concept, and the cinematography isn't awful.

9.0,"Sneaky, low key, BUT THRILLING! Sorta Hitchcockian ...","Really, I sat through this artwork patiently letting the story unfold as the first minutes, then into that first hour, seemed to uncover essential clues as to what was really going on. It seemed as though at one point that the story was to be halted and hung up on a classic cliche stall ... the main character making a mistake and all. Somehow, some way, I sat amazed as the impossible plot twist changed the vibe of the story in a way that I did NOT expect. A modern day story in the spirit of Hitchcock, you have to wait for it ...

5.0,"Okuno definitely has a lot of talent when it comes to filmmaking, but ""Watcher"" wasn't as compelling as it wants to be","Originally Premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival in the U. S. Dramatic Competition Selection.""Watcher"" is directed by Chloe Okuno and it's a story about a young American woman who moves with her husband to Bucharest. Isolated by the language barrier, she begins to suspect that a man watching her from the apartment building across the street might be a serial killer who has been beheading women throughout the city. Back in January, I attended the 2022 Sundance Film Festival and ended up skipping this one because I was a bit busy with other selections I was more interested in. Now ""Watcher"" has been released and I saw it, I honestly kind of glad I didn't see it right away. Because at the end of the day, while there are some great aspects about ""Watcher"", its really just a basic and really tame stalker movie. Okuno no doubt is trying her best which I applaud her for doing so. But it lacks.The production and camerawork are excellent. The sets and the scenarios helps to add some good layers of tension and what kind of environment the characters are in. Those moments were some of the highlights of this movie.The performances were mostly good especially Maika Monroe who really shines throughout this movie as she was the best part. The soundtrack and sound designs are also quite amazing and I applaud the technical groups on helping to make the atmosphere feel creepy at times. These positive aspects are overshadow by an repetitive annoying decisions that makes some moments frustrating, uninteresting characters that I wish were given enough depth but unfortunately had no emotionally barring to connect with at all, and the writing was way too predictable that you can just picking up little pieces and know what is going to happen next. It doesn't really allow much creativity for the audiences.As I mentioned about characters, Monroe's character lacks any form of connection as there is a little to know about her which makes it hard to connect and care about. Karl Glusman's character as the husband is a terrible person and constantly becomes more annoying as the film continues on. There were decisions made from the character that sometimes make you think to yourself ""What are you thinking?"" and ""Why would you do that."" When the third act does get a little interesting, the movie ends abruptly.The 1 hour and 30 min runtime pretty much doesn't feel worth it by the end of the day. Okuno wasn't able to create a masterpiece here and it ends up becoming forgettable by the end of the day. This is someone who loves weird horror movies and slow burn thrillers. It's not donut Okuno has a lot of talent but I believe she is still learning. Being her first debut, I believe she can do better than this.Rating: C.",okuno definitely has lot talent when it comes filmmaking but watcher wasnt as compelling as it wants be,originally premiered at 2022 sundance film festival u s dramatic competition selection watcher is directed by chloe okuno its story about young american woman who moves with her husband bucharest isolated by language barrier she begins suspect that man watching her apartment building across street might be serial killer who has been beheading women throughout city back january i attended 2022 sundance film festival ended up skipping this one because i was bit busy with other selections i was more interested now watcher has been released i saw it i honestly kind glad i didnt see it right away because at end day while there are some great aspects about watcher its really just basic really tame stalker movie okuno no doubt is trying her best which i applaud her doing so but it lacks production camerawork are excellent sets scenarios helps add some good layers tension what kind environment characters are those moments were some highlights this movie performances were mostly good especially maika monroe who really shines throughout this movie as she was best part soundtrack sound designs are also quite amazing i applaud technical groups helping make atmosphere feel creepy at times these positive aspects are overshadow by repetitive annoying decisions that makes some moments frustrating uninteresting characters that i wish were given enough depth but unfortunately had no emotionally barring connect with at all writing was way too predictable that you can just picking up little pieces know what is going happen next it doesnt really allow much creativity audiences as i mentioned about characters monroes character lacks any form connection as there is little know about her which makes it hard connect care about karl glusmans character as husband is terrible person constantly becomes more annoying as film continues there were decisions made character that sometimes make you think yourself what are you thinking why would you do that when third act does get little interesting movie ends abruptly 1 hour 30 min runtime pretty much doesnt feel worth it by end day okuno wasnt able create masterpiece here it ends up becoming forgettable by end day this is someone who loves weird horror movies slow burn thrillers its not donut okuno has lot talent but i believe she is still learning being her first debut i believe she can do better than this rating c,0.5250979179550608,0.11085429121143406,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
