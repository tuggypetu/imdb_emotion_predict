10.0,"Excellent, depressing, but excellent","Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10",excellent depressing but excellent,man i can not get this film out my head it is so rare that movie can affect me way pianst did last movie that did that was casino i was really tired when i was watching movie it was almost midnight so i was thinking that ill start watching ill finish it morning did i no indeed i did not stop watching i couldnt stop it i just wanted see what would happen next i cried during schindlers list i sobbed this film everything that happens this film is so sad adrien brody does remarkable job acting this film i would very highly recommend this film especially if you are history buff please i think this film should be top 10 best films all time i looked message boards you know some other user comments that didnt enjoy this film much they criticized adrien brodys performance say that he was boring only showed emotions that are easy act please you have got be kidding me this man portrayed total feeling hopelessness being alone being hated i one time had audition high school like this see if i could improvise way i imagined this feeling is like dodgeball where you have no one else your team youre only one left standing yet other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting wack that ball at you adrien couldnt have done better job i was so frightened him cried him during whole film while he was one run roman polanski as director he himself escaped terrors being prisoner holocaust yet he lost his mother other family members yes im sure this film must have been hard re create him but he was probably only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did he created this story made it so effective i called up my mom told her that i loved her so much because we take so many things granted true this isnt 1930s or 40s we are america but its still frightening think that human beings are capable that much hate being so brutal another human world war ii is one most frightening wars history if you read more about holocaust you get more into it you should if you are not interested then watch this film its must see otherwise how else will we learn our mistakes pianist is beautiful extremely dark tale about man struggle survive ending is so powerful moving know that sometimes one man can make difference crowd so many im not talking about adrien brodys character youll see what i mean 10 10,0.6304395711500975,0.09512573099415203,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,"A haunting film, one that you won't forget","I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10",haunting film one that you wont forget,i can remember when this film came out i was adamantly against seeing it i had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic jewish holocaust film where good triumphs over evil between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by germans add some flavour how wrong i was this is one best films i have ever seen what it did me i cannot describe words but nutshell it moved me made me cry made me feel like i was polish ghetto 1940 ultimately made me kiss sidewalks as i walked out theater thanked god that i live free society that i do roman polanski has proved that he is great director with films like chinatown rosemarys baby but this is his crowning achievement i think fact that this won awards that it did at this years oscars goes long way validate brilliance this film i believe that oscars are rigged most part films actresses such win based more their pedigree or business associations than anything else so when it won best actor director adapted screenplay this year it tells you that it should have won best picture but weinsteins seem have spell over everyone hence charlatan like chicago takes top prize sorry digression here but when you compare film like chicago masterpiece like pianist there really is one clear cut winner they handed out statue wrong movie pianist follows up coming piano player wlad spielzman his days as local hero prisoner war his time ghettos surviving only by kindness strangers i think many people have touched this before but what makes this film so amazing well crafted is because spielzman is man that we can all relate he is not hero he is not rebel he is not kamikaze type that wants lusts after revenge he is simple man that is doing everything his power stay alive he is desperate man fears his life wants stay as low as he can only succor he receives others does he manage live breathe eat hide this is how i related him if put his position how would i react exactly way he did this is man that had everything taken him his livelihood his family his freedom almost his life there is no time heroics here adrien brody embodies spirit spielzman his win at this years oscars was one happiest moments i have had watching festivities his speech was even better but that is topic another time ultimately it is his gift music that perhaps saves his life final scene that he has with german soldier is one most emotionally galvanizing scenes ive witnessed with very little dialogue it is eyes face mouth sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need know i think it is this scene that won brody his oscar this is one all time great performances i think polanski spoke heart here he has taken palette memories amalgamated them with what he has read given us one best films our generation any other i think pianist will go down as one best films this century when all is said done chicago will be forgotten way ordinary people was forgotten when people talk about film pianist they will do so with reverence respect this is cinematic masterpiece 10 out 10,0.535079365079365,0.18360766758494035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,A Masterpiece. Awesome acting by Brody.,"This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them.

8.0,An astonishing film,"The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939. The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons. However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color. Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero. Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first. The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout. His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film. The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever. The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching. In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death. In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head. The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance. Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great. After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint. He transcended my expectations. His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts. It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film. Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts. This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse. Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes. It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was. After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music. As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one. Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is. Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film. I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later. Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly",astonishing film,pianist is true story wladyslaw szpilman at time polands most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during nazi occupation warsaw beginning 1939 film spans several years maps his many personal trials addition providing perspectives his family rebel factions sympathizers brilliantly directed by roman polanski starring amazing adrien brody pianist is bound garner comparisons schindlers list obvious reasons however similar subject matter approach is different while schindlers list was filmed beautiful crisp black white that offered many incredible images pianist was filmed with almost muted color schindlers list featured what has been argued as complicated hero oskar schindler did save many jews but not without battling his own materialistic demons first pianists szpilman is sympathetic character throughout his plight was desperate demons he fought were over his own guilt surviving fight that eventually turns into primal will live polanski does not spare viewer any grief with his film horrific scenes between nazis warsaw jews were more terrifying horrible than any horror suspense movie i have seen some time possibly ever humiliation complete loss is wrenching several scenes jews are lined up middle night subjected either torture or death one case woman asks nazi officer what will happen us is promptly shot point blank head camera does not flinch or subdue any these atrocities mention must be made brodys performance having only previously seen brody two other films spike lees summer sam terrence malicks thin red line part that was supposed be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically i knew his potential was great after his oscar win i viewed this movie with more criticism than i normally would have he certainly did not disappoint he transcended my expectations his physical transformation was amazing but more importantly he conveyed sorrow this man shockingly well both verbal non verbal contexts it will be very interesting see what kind opportunities this role will afford him kinds roles he will accept something worth mentioning is affect this movie had audience with whom i viewed this film normally when film ends regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay watch credits their entirety rest audience stands up leaves usually chagrin remaining enthusiasts this was one few times i have seen film at theater where not one person stood leave during final credits it wasnt until house lights came up at end did people begin disperse personally i hightailed it out theater second lights came because not only was my face mess crying during film tammy faye comes mind but i had this overwhelming need emotional release so when i reached my car i sat wept about five minutes it has been years since i have watched film that upset me that extent conversely while discussing this film with my brother someone who loves movies as much has similar tastes as i do he mentioned that while he thought movie was excellent he wasnt as profoundly emotionally effected as i was after thinking about this couple days i realized difference music as classical music enthusiast erstwhile musician thought not being able enjoy much less play music you love is tragic one then emotional outpouring that comes when you return it there arent words describe how intense that is not having same appreciation this musical genre one will be able sympathize with physical emotional tribulations but perhaps not musical sense pianist was truly astonishing film i was riveted start finish so emotionally affected that i couldnt even consider writing review until week later having said that i am filing this away with my list movies which include schindlers list philadelphia as films that i love but cannot rewatch long time after due their intensely emotional content shelly,0.5466389992985737,0.10807428387215623,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,To hell and back.,"The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war. Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.",hell back,pianist is incredible film many aspects roman polanskis account survival pianist wladyslaw szpilman is document about how one man can overcome worst possible situations world gone completely mad around him only fault one can find with adaptation mr szpilmans story by playwright ronald harwood is fact that we never get know real wladyslaw szpilman man as some comments made this forum also have indicated there is very interesting point raised by pianists father who upon reading something paper comments about how americans have forgotten them well not only americans but rest world would not raise finger do anything people that were being imprisoned made live confined area warsaw exterminating camps will come later what is amazing film is frankness which director polanski portrays duplicity some jews ghetto fact that jews were used control other jews is mind boggling but it was fact its treated here matter factly had this been made by american director this aspect would have never surfaced at all yet mr polanski mr harewood show us that all was not as noble dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side war wladyslaw szpilman as played by adrien brody is puzzling sometimes that we never get know whats his mind hes man intent not dying but hes not fighter he accepts kindness extended him he never offers do anything other than keep hiding which is human instinct he will never fight side by side with real heroes ghetto uprising his role is simply witness battle his vantage point one safe houses across street where action takes place adrien brody is interesting actor watch as pianist story he exudes intelligence there is scene where szpilman one safe houses he is taken discovers upright piano one can see music his head he cant contain himself moving his fingers outside closed instrument playing glorious music which he can only imagine what it will sound his mind supporting cast is excellent frank findlay magnificent english actor is father pianist maureen lipman another veteran stage plays mother with refined dignity watching this film one can only shudder at thought another conflict that is currently brewing front our eyes we wonder if leaders different factions could be made sit through showing pianist make them realize that war is hell,0.511080586080586,0.132983682983683,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,"Stoic, haunting tale of survival","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away. During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips. This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is. The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European. And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or. Great music too.

10.0,Adrien Brody's Minimalist Acting Packs Maximum Emotional Punch,"This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways! It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off. It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away. (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head. Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won!

10.0,"""You musicians don't make good conspirators.""","Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.Given the film's title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked ""The Ghetto"" was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in ""Shtikat Haarchion"" (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in ""The Pianist"" or ""Schindler's List"", if that can even be imagined.

10.0,Definitively an inspiring epic...,"'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence: Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, ""I wish I knew you better."" Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss...",definitively inspiring epic,pianist is definitively inspiring epic that celebrates tenacity fortitude human spirit it is remarkable tale human survival sensitively brought life by polanski film carries us horrible reign terror where condemned people wearing emblem humiliation oppression are deprived their rights their human values dignity before being shipped labor camps polanskis movie all conventional elements drama are at peaks excellence family union when father has bargain buy single piece caramel divide it six pieces share it with each member his family starvation when ghetto inhabitant assaults helpless woman bowl soup confusion when distraught woman wails platform because she smothered cries her baby with her hand love when young musician turns his younger sister utters with sad regret i wish i knew you better survival when one man observes war through his hide outs around city cruelty when old man wheelchair is thrown off balcony by nazis because he failed stand upon their entrance fear when talented musician sits down at old piano pretends play his music keeping his fingers flowing with control above vertical ivories discrimination when bored nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old sick couples dance jewish street band by ghetto gate horror when condemned jewish workers lie face down street while one ss guard walks down line shooting without remorse each one back head isolation when fugitive emerges his harrowing hiding place walks through field deserted ruins exactly like last man alive polish soil adrien brody gives absolutely moving performance based descriptive facial expressions as polish composer pianist who stays alive as jew remains true his ideals brody captures characters desperation his anger grief his willpower perseverance his passion love music polanski gives us chance better know his shock disbelief his ordeal tragedy his hope fairness humanity nominated seven academy awards this captivating drama went win three oscars including best director best actor best adapted screenplay once brody took stage accept his oscar he was so overwhelmed with happiness that he swept gorgeous academy award winning halle berry off her feet with long steamy kiss,0.45114638447971767,0.10379188712522047,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"terrific movie, if relentlessly gritty and realistic","I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over.",terrific movie if relentlessly gritty realistic,i remember seeing schindlers list about ten years ago i remember how weird i felt being almost completely unmoved by it although it showed horrors holocaust quite realistically somehow it all seemed just bit too fake exaggerated characters were bit off i still cant decide who was more over top schindler or goeth fake sentimentalism was all over place while it was work art important reminder true events that shouldnt be forgotten emotional level it just somehow failed deliver enter pianist with no spielberg around put his trademark sappy material we finally have movie that shows true horror tragedy jewish people world war ii story is told through eyes one man wladislaw szpielman jewish pianist who works radio station warsaw during german occupation poland together with him we watch his world getting torn apart witness his family being taken away his existence being reduced bare essentials brody gives subtle yet spectacular performance his best work yet never once are we reminded that we are watching movie everything is shown szpielmans point view it is all very gritty realistic while spielbergs rendition german atrocities always had slightly staged feel augment their dramatic purpose here they are so true life there impact is much greater you watch are being reminded horror that this things actually happened while being very hard watch sometimes this is movie that schindlers list was supposed be this movie doesnt judge anybody or tries explain anything it shows historical events as reflection one mans fate making powerful testimony that stays with you long after beautiful last shot end credits are over,0.5238247863247864,0.05694444444444443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,10 out of 10,"The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2. Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood.",10 out 10,pianist is account true life experience polish pianist during ww2 context deportation jewish community ghetto warsaw setting virtually absent all films inspired ww2 polanski himself child survivor krakow warsaw ghettos could have described more detail legendary desperate fighting jewish resistance ghetto warsaw or horrific mass extermination concentration camps instead film gains intensity by displaying war pianists own point view through windows half opened doors holes walls with big emphasis use point view shooting by cameraman one cannot help feeling disturbed by most enthralling scenes film as isolated pianist tries ensure his survival ghetto ruins warsaw hiding fleeing moving one bombed house next gradually becoming shadow his former self hungry afraid merit largely attributed extraordinary performance by adrien brody who visibly loses half his weight throughout film does pianist raise any sympathy audience not immediately my view pianist is more than often drifting character almost witness other peoples his own horrors he seems float drift along film like lost feather with people quickly appearing disappearing his life some helping generously others taking advantage his quiet despair always maintaining almost blank dispassionate demeanour one may even wonder why we should care least about this character but we do care that is i believe secret this films poetry one strongest scenes towards end german officer forces pianist play his life episode that suddenly brings much lighter beautifully poetic shade film this german officer will be probably compared schindler although his philanthropy does not quite share same basis this is also wonderful tribute polish artists through chopins music with concert at very end film opening performance by pianist at local radio station with sound bomb explosions background forming harmonious link between beginning end film following polanskis usual story frame overall pianist is one most detailed shocking accounts treatment jews by nazis with atmosphere warsaw well captured believable quite possibly pianist will remain history film making as most touching realistic portraits holocaust ever made polanskis film deserves strong presence 2003 oscar nominations including nomination adrien brodys amazing performance polanskis sublime direction best adapted screenplay obviously best picture this could be at last polanskis long awaited triumphal comeback high mighty hollywood,0.45894088669950733,0.14668308702791463,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Heartfelt and enthralling,"THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.This film contains a documentary-style realism in its depiction of the various atrocities carried out by the uncaring Germans. It gets dark and darker as it goes on, and yet the viewer is unable to tear his eyes off the screen because it's all so well-realised and realistic. Adrien Brody plays the eyes and ears of the viewer in a subdued manner, yet delivers his greatest and most believable performance as a result. The story has a lot of darkness and violence, but Polanski's expert camera-work and endless style stops the subject matter ever becoming depressing; instead there's enough tension to keep you involved and wanting to find out what's next.

10.0,Tour de Force,"There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto.

8.0,Survivor,"Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman ""is"" -- or rather ""was"" -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, ""Then why the ****ing coat?"" Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, ""I was cold."" An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year.",survivor,film makers have step carefully when dealing with issues like nazi extermination program there have been equally brutal programs ethnic cleansing places like southeast asia rwanda which hundreds millions died but nothing like this europe since middle ages victims here were not only jews but gypsies mentally ill homosexuals socialists communists political undesirables nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 15 million event like that cant be treated lightly milked easy tears or event itself is cheapened fortunately films that have explored subject have been uniformly well done as roman polanskis pianist is well done polanski himself suffered much same way as protagonist vlad szpilman adrien brody polanski has habit embellishing his tales but theres no question that this instance he knows what hes talking about szpilman is well known young pianist warsaw radio but german occupation puts station out business he his family are herded into warsaw ghetto where they are subject constant abuse occasional murder szpilman barely escapes being sent treblinka with rest his family last half film with help some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid he scuttles rat like one hiding place another each more dismal perilous than last he suffers jaundice his hair beard grow long his clothes turn tatters his food disappears hes half frozen he seems shrink hes reduced living attic nearly demolished apartment building is ecstatic discover gallon can pickles overlooked top shelf kitchen cabinet can falls out his hands while he tries open it rolls across floor come rest at boots german officer captain hosenfeld thomas kretschmann only germans weve seen so far have been brutes ridiculing insane executing jews who ask simple questions or simply shooting people chosen at random we expect nothing hosenfeld except quick shooting but hosenfeld is human being having discovered that szpilman is or rather was pianist he asks him play piano left one flats szpliman has been unable play years when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off indeed his first chords are tentative uncertain then his playing becomes automated old habits return he dashes off dramatic exquisitely executed piece chopin hosenfeld has been leaning back enjoying music then leaves szpilman quietly his attic he returns few times later before germans withdraw before russians unceremoniously hands him few packages food finally his overcoat matter fact compassion shown by hosenfeld szpilmans desperate need contact with another human are very moving when russian troops finally arrive szpilman stumbles out his hovel greet them but seeing his overcoat russians open fire him szpilman finally convinces them that he is pole not german one befuddled soldiers asks then why ing coat szpilman is trembling with fear but manages gulp i was cold epilogue tells us that szpilman went with his career hosenfeld wound up soviet prison camp where he died 1952 despite szpilmans attempt find him under end credits smiling szpilman plays lively sparkling composition by chopin its remarkable film polanski is no longer wunderkind but mature film maker nothing is excessive we need only as much as we need know understand szpilmans travails one tragedy following another there are no sentimental speeches at final parting szpilman his family szpilman himself never breaks down he simply does what needs be done survive adrien brody captures what szpilman must have been like some angles he resembles young arthur rubenstein kretschmann gets hosenfeld down pat as well their scenes together we sense their respective positions one man with nothing left lose other with nothing left gain story historical facts its based raise many questions about human nature course im not at all sure that if we could find answers those questions we would like what we found one better films year,0.4429600235155791,0.0032952986656690315,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.47}"
9.0,"Brilliantly Narrated, Visually Stunning!","Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars.

7.0,Lacks a bit of character development and not as powerful as I expected it to be,"This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated.

Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting.

8.0,"Good, but imdb voters are overrating it","The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10.",good but imdb voters are overrating it,pianist is far roman polanskis best film or his most personal work as back dvd case says fact its easily least personal film ive seen him any director who has enough clout secure funding production could have made this film had it turn out just as well as director it is small achievement likewise screenplay writes itself fact it did write itself as its based true story i must admit i have bias against films dealing with wwii especially jewish experience europe affecting audience is as simple as snapping ones fingers or more specifically executing jew whenever audience starts get little comfortable all filmmaker has do is have nazi shoot jew head its all too easy any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important minds critics audiences which makes it difficult anyone propose any criticism against it truth be told pianist is very good film its well done while i dont think its polanskis best work he does good job but its too easy i think overpraise something like this it was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at oscars but after seeing film it doesnt surprise me this is kind movie that impresses academy most because its easy three awards it won were not deserved at least my opinion if i werent so familiar with academy their thought processes it would really shock me that polanski beat scorsese who made original picture with verve passion that brody i havent mentioned him he is good beat daniel day lewis who as ive just said above creates character that will live forever as screenplay ronald harwood or polanski could have made film much more than just one ten thousand tales survival there are lot moments when more substance could have been found i like how szpilman has constantly watch action while locked up room yearning be able do something about it but always relegated spectators role they do do well when they introduce character nazi soldier trying make good by helping szpilman but they dont do very much course i think part point is that this man appeared disappeared without much pomp or circumstance fact it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that szpilman discovered who this man was course that might have been disrespectful i have now seen all five best picture nominees last year i would rank them as follows 1 hours 2 gangs new york 3 pianist 4 lord rings two towers 5 chicago that i rank actual winner last shouldnt raise eyebrows because tell you truth i dont rank pianist two towers that much higher first two were original intelligent challenging last three were much simpler its no big surprise that they are more beloved 8 10,0.5111619441164895,0.2494478879706152,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"

,gripping though flawed drama,"`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out. The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story. That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it. For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece. Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself. In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels. First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity. As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber. `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family. `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process. Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst. Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust. But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965. This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event. `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.",gripping though flawed drama,pianist is bit like schindlers list as seen inside out one flaw that earlier film always seemed be that by choosing make gentile oskar schindler protagonist his film spielberg turned jews themselves almost into background players their own story that doesnt happen with pianist since hero this case happens be himself jew real life polish pianist composer wladyslaw szpilman who managed through strength determination assistance number brave caring individuals survive horrors that darkest most inexplicable chapter 20th century history this is not say that pianist is better film than schindlers list far it while this latest work roman polanski is fascinating tale survival its own right film lacks moral psychological resonance that made spielbergs work such universally acclaimed masterpiece because schindler was outsider looking he was forced make kind moral choices that szpilman never really faces situations which he finds himself fact one time that protagonist is confronted with such option having decide whether or not betray his people by joining jewish police whose job it is maintain order warsaw ghetto szpilman flat out declines offer this may indeed be way circumstances played themselves out real life but this elimination any kind psychological depth makes pianist seem frustratingly superficial at times although film isnt as rich powerful as it might have been pianist is still exceptional lot different levels first all polanski his screenwriter ronald hardwood both whom won oscars their work here capture brutality sadism nazi regime with frightening candor almost reportorial objectivity as schindlers list people this film die very believable very graphic ways particularly interesting are early sections film which we witness gradual steps leading up eventual deportation extermination warsaw jews beginning with curtailment jewish civil rights then branding them with stars david their clothing then their imprisonment warsaw ghetto finally inexorable walk gas chamber pianist doesnt take us that far screen but we sure sense presence those death camps loss szpilmans entire family pianist brilliantly recreates this shameful era recent human history does so without becoming sentimental pretentious process adrian brody won best actor oscar his performance here he is very good indeed especially given fact that role calls him be more reactor events around him than catalyst polanski hardwood have provided this fine young actor with veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with great deal skill aplomb unfortunately number other characters particularly those who go out their way help him remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout pianist is honorable addition list fine films that have attempted come grips with subject holocaust but my money best still remains shop main street oscar winning best foreign language film 1965 this superb czech film does what pianist is never quite able do which is find way involve us momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many people involved this life death event pianist by making its tale strictly story survival not study human psychology fails illuminate much what we really need know about that time about ourselves,0.5401658526658528,0.21169719169719164,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.46}"
8.0,Intense biography about a Polish pianist named Szpilman during the Warsaw ghetto,"This is an emotionally tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto. Polanski correctly directs a spellbinding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and proper experience on his childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides splendid actors, Frank Finlay,Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. Evocative cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's usual. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor, Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Warsaw ghetto uprising', the events happened on the following manner : In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Reinhard Heydrich chief of Gestapo began to place all Polish Jews in ghettos, where they could slowly die of hunger and disease. The campaign was to be administered by the Waffen-SS the party's military formations that fought as integral units in the armed forces. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these segregated areas established by the Nazis in Poland. In 1940 Heydrich, using the excuse that the spread of typhus had to be contained, set up a special section 11 miles in circumference enclosed by a brick wall 10 feet high. The cost was paid by the Judenrat, the Jewish Council of twenty-four-members, which was in charge of Jewish affairs inside the ghetto. In 1940 more than 80.000 gentile Poles living in the infected area were ordered to leave, and the next month about 140,000 living elsewhere in the city were moved in which the 240,000 still live in the ghetto. Some 360.000 Jews, a third of Warsaw's population, were herded into a 3,5-square-mile area. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents removed all Jews from the economic and cultural life of the city, from factories,shops, theaters, and libraries. On November 15,1940, the ghetto was sealed and its twenty-two entrances closed. No one was allowed to leave or enter, there was to be contact with the outside world.The situation soon became critical,Jews fought for jobs in the ghetto, including work with the labor battalions organized by the Nazis. Those unable to find work tried to exist by selling jewels,clothing, or anything else to obtain food. From 300 to 400 died daily in the Warsaw trap. More than 43.000 starved to death during the first year. Children crazed by hunger crawled through the sewers to the non-Jewish sectors of the city to smuggle in a bit of food. People were no longer moved by the sight of men and women falling dead on the streets. The Nazi authorities began intensified measure on July 22, 1942. As a memorial to Heydrich, Heirich Himmler ordered all Jews except those already in concentration camps to be deported .The ghetto and all labor camps would then be destroyed. Mass deportations to the gas chambers of Treblinka began. In two months 300.000 Jews were eliminated. The Judenrat was ordered to deliver 6.000 Jews daily for deportation. Each day thousands were driven by guards through the gates.Young Zionists, pioneers training to go to Palestine, mobilized first to be followed by members of the Polish workers party . On July 28, 1942, the Jewish Combat organization consisting about 1.000 men and boys was formed. All resolved to kill as many of their tormentors as they could before they died.The Jews fighting from rooftops, cellars, and attics,Poles outside the ghetto now began to send in more revolvers, grenades, and dynamite. In 1943 the guerrillas divided into twenty-two groups built an intricate network underground cellars and tunnels ,linked with command posts . In April 19,1943 German troops moved in on the ghetto to send all who were left to Treblinka in a final action. First came the armed trucks, tanks, and armored cars. The ghetto fighters poured a hail of bullets, grenades and bombs, the fighting went on for twenty-eight days. The guerrillas fought to the last. Many committed suicide at the moment before capture. The Germans dragged survivors from the cellars and rubble. Fewer than 100 escaped, the last 60000 Jews had been exterminated or killed in the explosions and fires.Polish sources reported that the fighters had killed 300 Germans and wounded 1000.

10.0,Spilzman? What a beautiful name for a pianist...,"In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his ""raison d'être"". As Stefan Zweig says: ""to read is to live"", well for him ""to play is to live"". Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: ""please, don't make noise"". Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: ""we have work certificates at last"" sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", the offbeat inhabitants of the building in ""the Tenant"". In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a ""in camera"" in spite of the sprawling scenery.The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's ""the Village"" (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, ""the Pianist"" has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics ""Oliver Twist"" met this year. The slump again?

Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie.

,"Film and Music, Pain and Fire","Spoilers herein.Nearly any film is for me a double experience: the watching and the post-coital rumination. That second phase can make the experience worthwhile even when the film itself is ordinary or poorly done.But it works the other way as well, especially when a film is designed for discussion: the film delivered with so many opinions that themselves are ordinary or poorly done. This film comes so charged. Szpilman wasn't `Jewish enough' to be the center of an important holocaust film, goes the most ordinary and loudest of them. I suppose there are some things about the commingling of descriptive art and definitive life to be said there. But one likes to have more freedom in post-film thoughts and that whole topic is dominated by the sorts of reflexive responses manipulated by film.There's a second prepackaged topic concerning whether `Schindler' was better or `worse.' I don't consider Spielberg's film a holocaust film at all: he lives in a happy world, where justice and right (and lots of other happy values) always triumph. His observations are always external. His goal is always to tell a story, a stance that furthers the distance between his films and reality. Polanski's project has no story at all, merely a life of accidents. His camera is within the artist's personal space. His own mannerisms are Eastern European and depressed, congruent with what he shows. (Speilberg's Schindler really did have the silk unctuousness of the East, but as observed from California.) So I credit Polanski's vision as having more historical credibility than Speilberg's, knowing that despite the best efforts of us all to avoid having practical history made by the movie marketplace.(One exception, where Polanksi is offensively theatrical: when Szpliman runs from the destroyed hospital, he faces a street of desolation as far as one can see, `High Noon'-wise.)Much more interesting to my mind is the portrayal of an artist. Polanski has always been deeply self-referential in his work: always there is an examination of the artist within the art. And I make a minor hobby out of collecting film experiences that do this with music and mathematics because I have some personal experience to work with. For those who don't know: Polands pride is Chopin, who invented a relationship to the piano that not only defined modernity but reinvented everything about musical performance. (Film would follow this lead in 1941.) Chopin built pieces designed to be bent in performance, designed with empty rooms that a pianist could explore. Unlike, Bach for instance, where the magic of the performance was in attuning to Bach and his intent, the performer of Chopin really could bring his own soul to parity with God. Szpliman was a strong pianist, and therefore more than a national character, instead a reflection of the Polish heart.Here, we watch this man compromise his own pride, eschew his religion, run away from every opportunity for dignity in order to keep his hands warm to play another day; and not just play, but play on the radio for Poles. So during this painful journey, we assume what we are meant to in films about tortured artists: that the pain we are watching will be transmuted by this man into great art that will lift us all. His own personal denigration - what is done to him and the denigrating choices he makes - are worth it overall.This is where the fatal pessimism of Polanski stops, because he doesn't let us know the musical truth. This is not Szpilmans playing of course, but not much unlike him. Szpilman was a `safe' player, one who never had the strength or desire to add much to Chopin. That's why he was on the radio: his `interpretations' were unchallenging and palatable. But he would never have been considered an artist of note at all if he had not survived the perfect brutality of the Germans, whose own music, though sentimental was constrained in ways that Chopin's never was. The payoff is supposed to be that after his trials, the artist is now - theoretically - capable of expressing the pain and yearning of the world. That we are meant to so think is clear from the end, where he plays with the glow of Dreyfuss from `Music of the Heart.'Ah, but not so. The sound we actually hear throughout is by Olejniczak, a similarly ordinary man. Szpilman did not in fact come through a better artist, but much worse: a meek pianist. `Shellshocked,' postwar contemporaries would say. Contrast this with Artur Rubinstein. Jewish Pole of the previous generation, and the first giant to explore Chopin's rubato. He had his own dark nights, but not because the world was inhospitable. Listen to his recordings (freely available) compared to Szpilmans (hard to get) or even Olejniczaks on the soundtrack. These are two different universes. One is merely pleasant, the other life-altering.Polanski has made some great films (including the under-appreciated `Ninth Gate'), and his thinking through of the intellectual reach of a project is extensive but he has ultimately let us down here. Implicit in much of modern Jewishness is the triumph of enrichment of the people through their tribulation. Perhaps that is true, but this film undermines the idea when selecting Szpilman as metaphor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",film music pain fire,spoilers herein nearly any film is me double experience watching post coital rumination that second phase can make experience worthwhile even when film itself is ordinary or poorly done but it works other way as well especially when film is designed discussion film delivered with so many opinions that themselves are ordinary or poorly done this film comes so charged szpilman wasnt jewish enough be center important holocaust film goes most ordinary loudest them i suppose there are some things about commingling descriptive art definitive life be said there but one likes have more freedom post film thoughts that whole topic is dominated by sorts reflexive responses manipulated by film theres second prepackaged topic concerning whether schindler was better or worse i dont consider spielbergs film holocaust film at all he lives happy world where justice right lots other happy values always triumph his observations are always external his goal is always tell story stance that furthers distance between his films reality polanskis project has no story at all merely life accidents his camera is within artists personal space his own mannerisms are eastern european depressed congruent with what he shows speilbergs schindler really did have silk unctuousness east but as observed california so i credit polanskis vision as having more historical credibility than speilbergs knowing that despite best efforts us all avoid having practical history made by movie marketplace one exception where polanksi is offensively theatrical when szpliman runs destroyed hospital he faces street desolation as far as one can see high noon wise much more interesting my mind is portrayal artist polanski has always been deeply self referential his work always there is examination artist within art i make minor hobby out collecting film experiences that do this with music mathematics because i have some personal experience work with those who dont know poland s pride is chopin who invented relationship piano that not only defined modernity but reinvented everything about musical performance film would follow this lead 1941 chopin built pieces designed be bent performance designed with empty rooms that pianist could explore unlike bach instance where magic performance was attuning bach his intent performer chopin really could bring his own soul parity with god szpliman was strong pianist therefore more than national character instead reflection polish heart here we watch this man compromise his own pride eschew his religion run away every opportunity dignity order keep his hands warm play another day not just play but play radio poles so during this painful journey we assume what we are meant films about tortured artists that pain we are watching will be transmuted by this man into great art that will lift us all his own personal denigration what is done him denigrating choices he makes are worth it overall this is where fatal pessimism polanski stops because he doesnt let us know musical truth this is not szpilman s playing course but not much unlike him szpilman was safe player one who never had strength or desire add much chopin thats why he was radio his interpretations were unchallenging palatable but he would never have been considered artist note at all if he had not survived perfect brutality germans whose own music though sentimental was constrained ways that chopins never was payoff is supposed be that after his trials artist is now theoretically capable expressing pain yearning world that we are meant so think is clear end where he plays with glow dreyfuss music heart ah but not so sound we actually hear throughout is by olejniczak similarly ordinary man szpilman did not fact come through better artist but much worse meek pianist shellshocked postwar contemporaries would say contrast this with artur rubinstein jewish pole previous generation first giant explore chopins rubato he had his own dark nights but not because world was inhospitable listen his recordings freely available compared szpilman s hard get or even olejniczak s soundtrack these are two different universes one is merely pleasant other life altering polanski has made some great films including under appreciated ninth gate his thinking through intellectual reach project is extensive but he has ultimately let us down here implicit much modern jewishness is triumph enrichment people through their tribulation perhaps that is true but this film undermines idea when selecting szpilman as metaphor teds evaluation 3 4 worth watching,0.48721209050996284,0.17631374535629857,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Shock appeal?,"The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.I hope shock appeal isn't the reason this film is liked so much, though. Because this is an amazing story about the will to survive. Music is the character's passion,and throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano. There is one scene near the end in which he finally gets the opportunity. What follows is a touching moment that transitions from rusty skills warming up to an intense and passionate display of artistic talent. In this moment there is no longer a war going on, no longer the agony of hunger or memories of lost loved ones, just beautiful music. His reputation as a musician and his desire to go on to play again is essentially what keeps him alive. And who says art isn't important?Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is, he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged.There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. An officer asks him, ""Why the f-cking coat?"" Brody, with his hands still in the air, a terrified look on his face, almost crying, replies: ""I'm cold."" That did it for me.The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky bastard who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.My rating: 10/10",shock appeal,pianist is not movie made entertainment its either more or less than that only viewer can decide you have ask yourself sometimes if main reason films about holocaust are so popular is because shock appeal if movie depicts these terrifying events well does that make it good movie pianist has many scenes showing nazis brutality that feel almost voyeuristic some scenes show adrien brodys character looking out window at these terrible things you feel as if youre looking out window too i hope shock appeal isnt reason this film is liked so much though because this is amazing story about will survive music is characters passion throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano there is one scene near end which he finally gets opportunity what follows is touching moment that transitions rusty skills warming up intense passionate display artistic talent this moment there is no longer war going no longer agony hunger or memories lost loved ones just beautiful music his reputation as musician his desire go play again is essentially what keeps him alive who says art isnt important adrien brody is very good this well obviously he is he just won best actor oscar i think he can be compared tom hanks cast away even scenes silence theres just something about actors movements expressions that keeps you engaged theres another scene near end that defines entire performance entire movie me after all trouble brody went through trying survive he is almost killed by people who would save him he is wearing coat that german officer had given him earlier when russian troops spotted brody they thought he was german they shot at him almost killed him but they finally found out he was polish officer asks him why f cking coat brody with his hands still air terrified look his face almost crying replies im cold that did it me pianist is certainly shocking even depressing film but like most movies that aspire provoke thoughts emotions audience takes out it what they bring it surely szpiellman wasnt just lucky bastard who survived times inhumane brutality it was through kindness compassion others who helped him if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music my rating 10 10,0.6354629629629629,0.07659722222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.39}"
6.0,Sobering Depiction Of Warsaw Under German Occupation,"The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie, but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 6/10",sobering depiction warsaw under german occupation,first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than holocaust movie although that dreadful event stands firmly background this movie is really about one mans struggle survival one man is polish jewish pianist wladyslaw szpilman adrien brody played that lead role he played it well szpilman comes across as both pitiful his desperation survive but at same time as noble his desperation survive brody portrays him as man with great dignity it was challenging role because as movie progresses theres less less dialogue simple reason that almost everyone except szpilman has been taken by nazis brody ends up playing long stretches without voice but it doesnt stop him rendering brilliant portrait man whose friends family are gone who simply tries live day by day hoping way out this madness just as haunting are extended scenes which director roman polanski simply shows us devastated warsaw not just jewish ghetto but other parts city as well scenes rubble scenes innocent people being gunned down street by german soldiers sometimes just sport without any other obvious reason scenes burned out buildings its all haunting all that all that was very good there was something about story that didnt really click with me some strange reason i found it difficult follow i did think that at almost two half hours it was little bit too long as much as was accomplished that running time could have been accomplished two hours flat its good movie but just failed reach level greatness that some have assigned it 6 10,0.4129126984126984,0.09320770202020205,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
