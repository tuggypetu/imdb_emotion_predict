4,"Overblown, overhyped latest addition to the Batman franchise","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulGotham City is rocked by a series of murders of key political figures, by a sadistic killer calling himself The Riddler (Paul Dano), who holds the city to ransom, revealing darkly guarded secrets and threatening more mayhem until he is stopped. 'The Batman' (Robert Pattinson), the alter ego of millionaire Bruce Wayne, starts an investigation of his own, crossing paths with a woman called Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), who operates as 'Catwoman' and wants to find out what happened to her friend. It sets them both on a collision course with the darkest elements of Gotham's underworld, including notorious gangster 'The Penguin' (an unrecognisable Colin Farrell) and crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who may be sitting on a devastating secret that could shatter both their lives.The Batman series must be one of the most enduringly successful franchises in the world of comic book films, appearing in various different incarnations since its original creation. Here, writer/director Matt Reeves delivers a mammoth three hour long interpretation of his own of the character that many seem to be hailing as the best ever. Less doesn't seem to be more anymore, at least not to the cinema artistes, but from this end, all I can see is a film drowning in its own indulgence.Reeves is obviously keen to maintain the bleak, heavy tone established by Christopher Nolan, and so we have a Gotham City with seemingly endless heavy rain, and gloomy skies, set against Pattinson's dark, brooding stare and gravelly voiceovers, set to the background of the emo rock soundtrack. It's just one of many things ripe for parody in a film that takes itself much too seriously and feels almost devoid of any humour and light. Even more overdone is Dano's dark 'Riddler', operating in some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous. Thrown in to this is the topical 'social justice' speeches that litter film and TV today, with Kravitz's Catwoman even praising the 'sinister' villain (who we're meant to hate!) at one point, for killing 'all these white privileged a$$holes.' It's just trying to cram a whole load of eggs in to one basket, over ambitious and overlong, and by the time of the main villain's grand 'master plan' at the end, you're too overwhelmed (or bored) to care.Everyone else can think what they like, but personally this is one of the most pretentious Batman's ever, which might have been a bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent, or at least had an old fashioned, Lawrence of Arabia style 'intermission' at some point. **",overblown overhyped latest addition batman franchise,star rating brilliant very good okay poor awfulgotham city is rocked by series murders key political figures by sadistic killer calling himself riddler paul dano who holds city ransom revealing darkly guarded secrets threatening more mayhem until he is stopped batman robert pattinson alter ego millionaire bruce wayne starts investigation his own crossing paths with woman called selina kyle zoe kravitz who operates as catwoman wants find out what happened her friend it sets them both collision course with darkest elements gothams underworld including notorious gangster penguin unrecognisable colin farrell crime boss carmine falcone john turturro who may be sitting devastating secret that could shatter both their lives batman series must be one most enduringly successful franchises world comic book films appearing various different incarnations since its original creation here writer director matt reeves delivers mammoth three hour long interpretation his own character that many seem be hailing as best ever less doesnt seem be more anymore at least not cinema artistes but this end all i can see is film drowning its own indulgence reeves is obviously keen maintain bleak heavy tone established by christopher nolan so we have gotham city with seemingly endless heavy rain gloomy skies set against pattinsons dark brooding stare gravelly voiceovers set background emo rock soundtrack its just one many things ripe parody film that takes itself much too seriously feels almost devoid any humour light even more overdone is danos dark riddler operating some garish gimp suit that just looks ridiculous thrown this is topical social justice speeches that litter film tv today with kravitzs catwoman even praising sinister villain who were meant hate at one point killing all these white privileged holes its just trying cram whole load eggs one basket over ambitious overlong by time main villains grand master plan at end youre too overwhelmed or bored care everyone else can think what they like but personally this is one most pretentious batmans ever which might have been bit more bearable if it had just been less self indulgent or at least had old fashioned lawrence arabia style intermission at some point,0.564310344827586,0.10275862068965516,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10,Everything I wanted and more,"I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10.",everything i wanted more,i have been absolutely fizzing see batman day it was announced but even more so when i first heard it described as being inspired by se7en one my favourite psychological thrillers all time were we finally going get raw gritty batman film id always dreamed seeing we certainly were where begin biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got spend with batman as batman there is very little bruce wayne this movie im absolutely fine with that movie is batmans story we are with him start finish we even get some narration him which im not quite sure how i feel about just yet it was very good narration but im not sure hes character i want it riddler this movie is phenomenal after joker dark knight this is absolutely my second favourite batman film villain he was clearly inspired by zodiac killer what inspired choice also use riddles film is nothing short genius these are very clever riddles puzzles make batman have do some serious detective work something ive always wanted more him previous films this is my favourite incarnation catwoman date i havent loved her characters place films past ive found she slows everything down brings out dull side batman that i havent enjoyed this film though she was used perfectly shes love interest villain anti hero all one that is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down batman film pointless love interest penguin was probably one letdown me what id seen trailer i suspected this may be case im wondering if they were using this movie as set up him then second film he will evolve have lot more do this one though i just found him quite dull screen presence robert pattinson as batman blew me away he looked great his voice was perfect he was extremely intense very menacing even though i knew he was more than capable playing role i think i still needed see end product just confirmation that he had what it takes he absolutely did then some film has quite unique feel there are scenes sequences this film that would feel out place both tim burtons batman universe christopher nolans universe but then there are little aspects each their respective films which clearly inspired parts batman it basically took best things each them then twisted them into its own style while obviously adding lot its own stuff also its very well done that sense batmobile this movie is awesome theres just no other way put it sound it made vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone chilling chase sequence this movie with penguin is one best ive ever seen film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it theres short period middle movie where everything slows down little while that really is only flat part movie however rest happens at break neck pace its hard find enough good things say about this movie i need see it again digest couple things little longer but now i have it firmly sitting second place behind dark knight my order favourite batman films 10 10,0.546479098386993,0.1439662256603046,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9,"Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take","The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.",perhaps not definitive version but definitely worthwhile take,riddler paul dano spot how did it take this long him get role like this targets public officials revealing their corruption killing them gruesome fashion how did this get away with pg 13 again oh right as long as you dont show details then you can get away with almost anything by now even barely toned down jigsaw order stop him it will be necessary bat cat with amazing chemistry together stop rat thanks matt i really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with bruce waynes alter ego how about nightwing i know its not likely but part me still holds out hope that grayson will be turned into feature if youve never checked out trailer youtube youre missing out but somehow this managed convince me fingers crossed at least one sequel robert pattinson is incredible here seriously can we just stop freaking out every time role is recast closest weve come someone who shouldnt be doing it is george clooney its not like anybody came out that flick looking good he took that job after doing dusk till dawn there was good reason think that he was going be badass honestly everyone here gives strong performance something that will definitely appeal some more than others is genre tone this is essentially se7en meets zodiac it is not paced like typical massive blockbuster while action is great especially martial arts not mention that car chase theres less it it is smaller scale than example nolan trilogy which also has far more escalation essentially this just isnt focused that much that aspect titular icon i think we can all agree that weve had some great entries that deliver that this is more interested conveying audience that theres reason hes called worlds greatest detective weve barely seen it outside animated ones before so im very happy with that choice by them addition what ive already mentioned this features some drugs suggestive material strong language i recommend this any fan batman 9 10,0.5088924963924965,0.20636724386724384,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.33}"

3,The epitome of try-hard,"Matt Reeves is not a good director at all-- -he's made one decent film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and everything else he's done falls into one of two categories: junk and overrated junk. (Thank goodness The Batman is at least the latter instead of the former). If the director wasn't trying sooooo hard to make the film 'dark' maybe he could have created a new category of just overrated.Firstly, David Fincher himself is bad enough, but David Fincher imitations are even worse. This movie's rote serial-killer plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that Nolan already played around with, most notably the 'but he wanted to be captured!' eye-roller. (Also irritating are Reeves' cheap attempts to desecrate Schubert's music while indulging the trope of the classical music-loving psychopath). Modern culture's obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peeves---they are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same. Exchange the Riddler for any of the killers in Fincher's movies and there is basically no difference. And it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the Riddler's petty mind games- - if I was there I would promptly tell him to p*ss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere, even if there was a bomb strapped to my neck.Secondly, the casting is sometimes bizarre. DC has often thrived on unorthodox casting-if they can make Ben Affleck work as Batman anything goes-but they trip up here since we have the high-water mark of the Nolan trilogy to compare it to. Andy Serkis as Alfred? That completely does not work; he just lacks the sophistication of Michael Caine. The new Commissioner Gordon is no Gary Oldman, that's for sure. The Riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate Heath Ledger. (The Riddler from the '66 Batman show was vastly superior--heck, Jim Carrey was). The new Catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting, but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry ON and ON about some friend of hers that ends up killed. Why she's so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even Batman dares solve. The closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin--- the car chase scene was great even as I kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the road.Thirdly, the pacing is off. I've seen people accuse Nolan of being portentous, but The Batman takes it to a whole new level with it's bloated runtime. It doesn't even have the quasi-grandeur of the Snyder Cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the Penguin's club ad nauseam. Reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, but other than a 'Rear Window' throwback in the opening scene I don't see it. The film is mostly shot like a generic TV procedural filtered through a David Fincher lens, and Reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made Hitchcock so sublime. (Compare any Riddler murder to the one in 'Dial M for Murder', which is one of the more mediocre Hitchcocks). Reeve's sole technique for suspense is to have the Riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters about.Ugh. If any good this would have become DC's highest grossing film ever. As it is, people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop.",epitome try hard,matt reeves is not good director at all hes made one decent film rise planet apes everything else hes done falls into one two categories junk overrated junk thank goodness batman is at least latter instead former if director wasnt trying sooooo hard make film dark maybe he could have created new category just overrated firstly david fincher himself is bad enough but david fincher imitations are even worse this movies rote serial killer plot indulges every single one irritating tropes that nolan already played around with most notably but he wanted be captured eye roller also irritating are reeves cheap attempts desecrate schuberts music while indulging trope classical music loving psychopath modern cultures obsession with inadvertent glorification serial killers is one my greatest pet peeves they are just pathetic boring characters who are all same exchange riddler any killers finchers movies there is basically no difference it irritated me no end how practically every character allowed themselves fall prey riddlers petty mind games if i was there i would promptly tell him p ss off take his stupid video calls elsewhere even if there was bomb strapped my neck secondly casting is sometimes bizarre dc has often thrived unorthodox casting if they can make ben affleck work as batman anything goes but they trip up here since we have high water mark nolan trilogy compare it andy serkis as alfred that completely does not work he just lacks sophistication michael caine new commissioner gordon is no gary oldman thats sure riddler joins swelling ranks villains desperately trying imitate heath ledger riddler 66 batman show was vastly superior heck jim carrey was new catwoman is alright given rest this casting but is rendered irritating by script that causes here carry about some friend hers that ends up killed why shes so emotionally attached this friend is mystery not even batman dares solve closest thing saving grace is infamously unrecognizable colin farrell as penguin car chase scene was great even as i kept wondering why none vehicles were hydroplaning with something like full inch water road thirdly pacing is off ive seen people accuse nolan being portentous but batman takes it whole new level with its bloated runtime it doesnt even have quasi grandeur snyder cut due banal serial killer story which mostly requires people pop out penguins club ad nauseam reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by alfred hitchcock but other than rear window throwback opening scene i dont see it film is mostly shot like generic tv procedural filtered through david fincher lens reeves completely lacks morbid playfulness that made hitchcock so sublime compare any riddler murder one dial m murder which is one more mediocre hitchcocks reeves sole technique suspense is have riddler hovering around background while unsuspecting victim putters about ugh if any good this would have become dcs highest grossing film ever as it is people will lose interest after little while box office receipts will drop,0.5170061451958002,0.008704470816539788,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"

3,I like slow-burn. This was just dull.,"I went in with ultra-low expectations because I think Robert Pattison is a god-awful actor and, this film took my expectations and made me promptly realise that, you can always go lower.I'm actually angry I wasted 3 hours of my life (and trust me, every minute of that time was felt).However, let's have some positives: cinematography is great and the music is fantastic. The opening scenes with The Batman made me think, I was going to have another Heath moment and be forced to eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special.But then the film gets going. Part ""Saw"" rip-off and so desperately wants to be ""Se7en"" in its execution, the story dragged. You don't care about any of the characters and I found myself pining for Clooney and his bat-nipples and Mr. Freeze.What I found really funny though is the producer of this utter mess got in touch with Nolan and warned him, ""We're going to make a better Batman than you."" No. Just no.Like the last Lord of The Rings film, this has an ending that just keeps on coming. Something wraps up and you start to get ready to leave, the film continues. Something else is wrapped up and you think, ""That's it..."" and it keeps going.... Something else, and on and on and on...I can see why the guy in the seat nearby racked up a massive line of coke and snorted it midway through (and no, I'm not joking... Welcome to Southampton).With regards to the plank of wood.... Sorry... ""Pattison"". In the initial scenes I was genuinely excited. Never a fan of his costume before, seeing it here - suddenly I ""got it"". He proper beats down on someone in a vicious attack. They get back up... In fact, everyone he bat-punches gets back up and just attacks him from behind again. There's no real threat here. When Bale smacked someone down, they stayed dead. But then, when Bale stripped off (same as Affleck), they were built. Robert looked like me and I look like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. A skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever. In fact, when Robert bent over in one topless scene, his bones stuck out and I thought wings were going to pop out. But then, why wouldn't they when he infamously said he refused to bulk up for the role (I would have sacked him there and then).His time as Bruce is strictly limited - thank God - so you can't really judge him for that. As Bruce he just stands there and looks confused. As The Batman, by the end he became a parody. His Batman voice changed to the same sound as the joke Batman in the college humour videos (A is for Alfred = genius). When he was mad, it just look like he was pulling a cum-face. And don't even get me started on the Adrian Mole diary keeping that's going in with the voice-over narration.Honestly, with the exception of the opening ten minutes or so, I have never hated a film so much as I did this and given I went in with low expectations, even I am surprised at how fuming I am at myself for wasting my time on it.",i like slow burn this was just dull,i went with ultra low expectations because i think robert pattison is god awful actor this film took my expectations made me promptly realise that you can always go lower im actually angry i wasted 3 hours my life trust me every minute that time was felt however lets have some positives cinematography is great music is fantastic opening scenes with batman made me think i was going have another heath moment be forced eat my words because those opening scenes are indeed something special but then film gets going part saw rip off so desperately wants be se7en its execution story dragged you dont care about any characters i found myself pining clooney his bat nipples mr freeze what i found really funny though is producer this utter mess got touch with nolan warned him were going make better batman than you no just no like last lord rings film this has ending that just keeps coming something wraps up you start get ready leave film continues something else is wrapped up you think thats it it keeps going something else i can see why guy seat nearby racked up massive line coke snorted it midway through no im not joking welcome southampton with regards plank wood sorry pattison initial scenes i was genuinely excited never fan his costume before seeing it here suddenly i got it he proper beats down someone vicious attack they get back up fact everyone he bat punches gets back up just attacks him behind again theres no real threat here when bale smacked someone down they stayed dead but then when bale stripped off same as affleck they were built robert looked like me i look like mr burns simpsons skeletal mess with no beef there whatsoever fact when robert bent over one topless scene his bones stuck out i thought wings were going pop out but then why wouldnt they when he infamously said he refused bulk up role i would have sacked him there then his time as bruce is strictly limited thank god so you cant really judge him that as bruce he just stands there looks confused as batman by end he became parody his batman voice changed same sound as joke batman college humour videos is alfred genius when he was mad it just look like he was pulling cum face dont even get me started adrian mole diary keeping thats going with voice over narration honestly with exception opening ten minutes or so i have never hated film so much as i did this given i went with low expectations even i am surprised at how fuming i am at myself wasting my time it,0.490611279972982,-0.025894967916244533,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
4,"Melodramatic, monstrously long, mediocre, and boring.","I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's ""Everyone is just scared of him."" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score.

2,What are these reviews? Cringey garbage.,"To preface this review I will say when watching this in the cinemas, many people walked out. I was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers.The actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain (the riddler) and the Batman. Penguin was by far the coolest and best actor. Honestly a good fellas type character. All other supporting actors were also quite good. I however think Robert pattinson a horrible pick for Batman. The whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid, I was half expecting him to say ""gosh get outta my room"". Absolutely trash acting The riddler was even worse! He was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable. His video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school, their budgets were $0.The relationship between the Batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie. The romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension. They rode around In their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute.The bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a Batman film. The old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lie.Now to answer everyone's questions I do think Robert pattinson was a terrible choice for Batman for a few reasons. At first I had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role, he just isn't a badass over masculine kinda guy, like at all. He seems awkward and it shows. His voice wasn't that great, his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans, heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad. The guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors. The story was God awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die, bombs go off and some personal people Batman knows get injured. Then Batman goes welp I can't be in 3 places at once I'm only human. And proceeds to get ko'd twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights. He is by far the worst and weakest looking Batman with the worst actor to have played him. The cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible. Did I mention this film is 3 hours long to have a crap middle and end? Well know I know!. Wow I couldn't wait for thr 3 hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished. Definitely wouldn't reccomend this garbage piece of cinema. 2/10 for me.",what are these reviews cringey garbage,preface this review i will say when watching this cinemas many people walked out i was looking over my shoulder see anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers actors this were one highlights excluding villain riddler batman penguin was by far coolest best actor honestly good fellas type character all other supporting actors were also quite good i however think robert pattinson horrible pick batman whole time he seems like really awkward sad goth kid i was half expecting him say gosh get outta my room absolutely trash acting riddler was even worse he was major cringe factor this movie with awful dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating laughable his video calls reminded me horror films my 15 year old class mates had made high school their budgets were 0 relationship between batman cat woman was my only other plus this movie romance was quite sweet had lot tension they rode around their awesome motorcycles just roaring through town it was really cute bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird batman film old classic camaro was little spine chilling not gonna lie now answer everyones questions i do think robert pattinson was terrible choice batman few reasons at first i had no qualms but watching film made me believe he was bad cringey actor role he just isnt badass over masculine kinda guy like at all he seems awkward it shows his voice wasnt that great his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans heck even joker is ripped suicide squad guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny it shows next bigger actors story was god awful without spoiling pretty much lots people die bombs go off some personal people batman knows get injured then batman goes welp i cant be 3 places at once im only human proceeds get kod twice throughout movie punched lots during fights he is by far worst weakest looking batman with worst actor have played him cinematography was good horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible did i mention this film is 3 hours long have crap middle end well know i know wow i couldnt wait thr 3 hours end multiple people walked out before film was half finished definitely wouldnt reccomend this garbage piece cinema 2 10 me,0.5970998445998446,-0.026868686868686868,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.28}"
6,A good Batman movie,"The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

2,Too long; too drawn-out; too nihilistic.,"What were Reeves and Craig thinking? I mean, wasn't the Douglas Nolan Bat-trilogy with Christian Bale dark and pessimistic enough? Did they have to try and top that by painting Bruce Wayne's parents as not being so spotless? And what was with the nearly three-hour running time?Between those two factors, this movie felt more like the love child of ""Gone With The Wind"" and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker flick. Which is most definitely _not_ a good thing! The only reason I give this two stars, instead of one, is because of the unexpected (but surprisingly effective) blending of the Riddler with Hush.Well, that, and the casting of Jeffrey Wright...who does a commendable job as Jim Gordon.",too long too drawn out too nihilistic,what were reeves craig thinking i mean wasnt douglas nolan bat trilogy with christian bale dark pessimistic enough did they have try top that by painting bruce waynes parents as not being so spotless what was with nearly three hour running time between those two factors this movie felt more like love child gone with wind joaquin phoenixs joker flick which is most definitely not good thing only reason i give this two stars instead one is because unexpected but surprisingly effective blending riddler with hush well that casting jeffrey wright who does commendable job as jim gordon,0.5633928571428571,0.13839285714285715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
2,"Way too long, Pattinson Batman is brooding and sleepy","I'll say it started pretty good and I liked the cinematography. But I thought it dragged on, and the social commentary on destroying ""white privileged men"" was ironic as that's what Batman is- a privileged white rich guy who can mascarade as a vigilante because he's rich and has all the free time to do so; and we feel for him because boo boo he's an orphan. This was a very obvious ""woke"" fest. I like the diversity but it's when they blatantly shove rhetoric down your throat that it starts to become cringey.

6,The Emo Batman,"I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.",emo batman,i will say i liked story but long dragged out slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous you could watch this at 1 5x speed it would be more enjoyable this needed at least 20 mins cut out much faster storytelling constant whisper dialogue most film became annoying really fast i do like pattinson as actor but not as batman this one he wasnt convincing his monotonic whispering dialogue emo demeanor was very lackluster point cringeworthy thats him both as batman even more so as bruce wayne whats with colin farrell being cast with all these prosthetics play penguin was every other actor that naturally has that characters look unavailable its not like farrell has particular set penguin skills lol casting farrell as batman pattinson as penguin now that wouldve worked much better imo im also big fan westworlds jeffrey wright but here again he was very unconvincing as gordon especially when he also had that monotonic whispering emo demeanor i get that director joint writer reeves was going that dark lonely dreary theme but instead characters looked bored inexperienced actors with sore throats only one that nailed their character perfectly was lovely beautiful kravitz who stole entire show i wouldve rather watched 4 hour movie with just her as catwoman all affleck keaton bale kilmer even clooney batman characters were much more convincing as well as having more better keep you awake action said films sadly this one is generous yet disappointing 6 10 me,0.5979166666666667,0.15395833333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.41}"
2,Emoman a DCsastrous Batman re-boot,"Right from the 1st leaked screenshots I had doubts about this movie, wasn't bothered by the fact Robbie Pattinson was playing the main man, moody, morose, silent, he had all the things necessary to portray the brooding Batman, unfortunately he had no screen presence, the Batman's mere look should strike fear, Pattinsons didn't, had the resounding thumps of his Jack boots not been amplified to sound like a herd of elephants it would've been easy for him to go unnoticed among the throngs of police officers & various characters.The only scene that attempted to inject any excitement was the ""budget Batmobile"" chase scene, overly long, quite pointless & shockingly silly and far far too loud, another problem with this movie, whereas the musical score was for the most part the best thing about this movie it's actual sound was one of the worst, every screech, scream and gunshot was turned up to maximum, deafening the audience.Of course the real villain of this movie is the story or more precisely its lack of one, yes we're introduced to ""the Penguin"" an overweight balding scar faced slob that screams more sleazy pervert than villain & a complete waste of use of the character then its ""the Riddler"" a bespectacled ""youtuber"" in what's best described as a gimp costume, a character with no special talents yet is somehow able to enter unseen an exclusive apartment and commit murder, a locked vehicle to over power it's driver and enter unseen a police gym and over power the cheif of police and kidnap him and all the while screeching like a banshee on video & facetime.The films runtime is far too long telling a story that is uninteresting and ultimately very boring, there are no heroic deeds performed no good guy to root for.The time line for this movie becomes apparent from the diary kept by Bruce Wayne and various TV news broadcasts, this is year two in the career of the Batman yet he isn't the vigilante that's feared by the criminal underground yet he's hated by the police force, with no context to work from of his past deeds as a vigilante its very confusing.Quite simply this isn't a movie about Batman , Pattinson could have played the character without the costume and the movie would have still been the same, a very boring lacklustre detective story.Zoe Kravitz plays Catwoman, a character completely different to the Halle Berry version but played equally as badly.Put simply this movie ranks worse Batman movie behind the awful Batman and Robin, as the caped crusader Pattinson isn't a patch on Keaton, Kilmer, Bale or even Afflek.I can only imagine Warner Bros/DC wanted to emulate the profits they raked in from ""The Joker"" so decided to give Batman the same treatment but where ""Joker"" stripped away everything and concentrated on the character ""The Batman"" strips away everything about the character and concentrates on everything else, the sets, cinematography and secondary characters are fine tuned and highly detailed whereas Batman is reduced to a pair of ""Jack boots"" clumping through the movie.By the end of Matt Reeves ""The Batman"" I felt I knew a little about what it was like to be in a hostage situation, the elation I felt at the ending of the movie gave newly found strength to my numbed legs allowing me to bound out from the cinema seat seeking the freedom of the evening air, it was a wonderful experience, something I sadly can't say about the movie.Nolans trilogy is still the best, he gave the character a begging a middle and an end and he did it with style all the while telling a complex and interesting story about complex and interesting characters, Matt Reeves fails abysmally with ""The Batman"" choosing to emulate scenes from past Batman movies rather than creating something new and unseen, from Keatons Bruce Wayne to Bales Dark Knight it's all there easily recognised.If this is Reeves idea of re-booting the character for a new generation then it was a pointless endeavour, the new generation hasn't the need or interest for it, they certainly don't have the patience to sit through 3 hours of it.The movie is about the beginning of Batman's career when he is young, full of the energy necessary to fight the criminals and crime of Gotham city, Pattinsons ""Batman"" meanders through the movie as if he were a zombie looking disinterested and deflated, this is not a superhero movie nor a movie about a hero, it should not be a movie at all.",emoman dcsastrous batman re boot,right 1st leaked screenshots i had doubts about this movie wasnt bothered by

3,Maybe Schumacher wasn't so bad,"I've seen campy Batman movies from Joel Schumacher, I've seen more grounded/realistic Batman movies from Christopher Nolan, and I've even seen a goofy Batman movie from Chris McKay, but there's one thing I never in my life thought I'd see...a boring Batman movie. Matt Reeves pulled off that unlikely feat with this 3-hour-long drudgery of a film. Admittedly, I'm coming at this as a person who has never clicked with the character of the dark knight. I find Batman to be massively overrated, and I struggle to see why the entire world bows down to him as if he's the greatest superhero of all time. That being said, I can still find entertainment from his stories, and rarely have outright hatred for the films (aside from when Zack Snyder directs them.)The Batman feels like a film made after Matt Reeves spent a great deal of time reading fan discussions on the internet, so it ticks a number of the boxes that I've heard comic book nerds complain about over the years. They make a point of never having Batman kill anyone. I mean, one could argue a few received head wounds that could easily lead to their death, and he caused a car crash that could easily have been fatal, but at least he's not pulling out a gun on anyone or dropping people off the top of a building. Also, all those fanboys love to talk about Batman being the world's greatest detective, so in this movie the first time we see the Caped Crusader, he's literally walking into an active crime scene. It's a ridiculous juxtaposition that made me chuckle, but I'm sure there were some people out there who wanted to applaud that moment.The other aspect of The Batman that had me chuckling when I don't think they intended anything to actually be funny was when we meet Bruce Wayne outside of the mask. First of all, there's another bit of fan service in the fact that we actually see him with black makeup smeared around his eyes. But worse than that is just the exaggerated emo goth-kid look that makes it appear that Robert Pattinson is cosplaying as Gerard Way from My Chemical Romance. There were more than a few scenes where we are looking at Bruce Wayne through a bunch of long greasy black bangs and I was wondering who thought that was a good idea. I will give Pattinson credit for not overdoing the Batman voice too much, and almost always disguising his native British accent.As I said at the start, though, the big problem with The Batman is just the fact that it's boring. The film drags on and even the action sequences feel kind of bland and lacking in memorable moments. There's one car chase that stands out as the biggest moment where I was literally checking the time, because it added nothing to the plot of the film. The entire plot is a non-stop series of tropes that feel like I'm watching someone who wants to do a Tarantino-style homage to other crime-thrillers, but without the talent of Tarantino. The story is slow-moving, and insanely repetitive. I could not believe how many times they returned to the same places and did the same things. There was a complete lack of efficiency in the storytelling, as if no one was willing to cut anything, and I felt there were entire characters and storylines that could have easily gone without hurting the story one bit.The entire movie is built around a big puzzle, which I can get behind. It started developing as though there was a genuine murder mystery for us to uncover. But as things started to move along it became clear they didn't have a reveal that would warrant all the time they spent building it up. As a side note, I think I'll be happy if I never again have to see a scene where a person is questioned about who is the big bad behind everything, and they say they can't tell because something worse than death will happen to them. This only works as a stupid stalling technique to build suspense for the audience, and if you don't have a satisfactory surprise pay-off at the end it's totally ridiculous. Needless to say, The Batman did not have said pay-off. Its biggest surprise was that it wouldn't end because they constantly had one more scene. In every way I found The Batman to be a lackluster movie that somehow made me nostalgic for the days of Schumacher.",maybe schumacher wasnt so bad,ive seen campy batman movies joel schumacher ive seen more grounded realistic batman movies christopher nolan ive even seen goofy batman movie chris mckay but theres one thing i never my life thought id see boring batman movie matt reeves pulled off that unlikely feat with this 3 hour long drudgery film admittedly im coming at this as person who has never clicked with character dark knight i find batman be massively overrated i struggle see why entire world bows down him as if hes greatest superhero all time that being said i can still find entertainment his stories rarely have outright hatred films aside when zack snyder directs them batman feels like film made after matt reeves spent great deal time reading fan discussions internet so it ticks number boxes that ive heard comic book nerds complain about over years they make point never having batman kill anyone i mean one could argue few received head wounds that could easily lead their death he caused car crash that could easily have been fatal but at least hes not pulling out gun anyone or dropping people off top building also all those fanboys love talk about batman being worlds greatest detective so this movie first time we see caped crusader hes literally walking into active crime scene its ridiculous juxtaposition that made me chuckle but im sure there were some people out there who wanted applaud that moment other aspect batman that had me chuckling when i dont think they intended anything actually be funny was when we meet bruce wayne outside mask first all theres another bit fan service fact that we actually see him with black makeup smeared around his eyes but worse than that is just exaggerated emo goth kid look that makes it appear that robert pattinson is cosplaying as gerard way my chemical romance there were more than few scenes where we are looking at bruce wayne through bunch long greasy black bangs i was wondering who thought that was good idea i will give pattinson credit not overdoing batman voice too much almost always disguising his native british accent as i said at start though big problem with batman is just fact that its boring film drags even action sequences feel kind bland lacking memorable moments theres one car chase that stands out as biggest moment where i was literally checking time because it added nothing plot film entire plot is non stop series tropes that feel like im watching someone who wants do tarantino style homage other crime thrillers but without talent tarantino story is slow moving insanely repetitive i could not believe how many times they returned same places did same things there was complete lack efficiency storytelling as if no one was willing cut anything i felt there were entire characters storylines that could have easily gone without hurting story one bit entire movie is built around big puzzle which i can get behind it started developing as though there was genuine murder mystery us uncover but as things started move along it became clear they didnt have reveal that would warrant all time they spent building it up as side note i think ill be happy if i never again have see scene where person is questioned about who is big bad behind everything they say they cant tell because something worse than death will happen them this only works as stupid stalling technique build suspense audience if you dont have satisfactory surprise pay off at end its totally ridiculous needless say batman did not have said pay off its biggest surprise was that it wouldnt end because they constantly had one more scene every way i found batman be lackluster movie that somehow made me nostalgic days schumacher,0.5651909722222225,0.0187326388888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5,When you expect too much... you're let down easily.,"Wonderfly shot. Love the serial killer type approach. Matt Reeves never disappoints with choice of color, tone and over all cinematography.That being said, the story wasnt that interesting to be honest. Nothing was surprising or intriguing and because of that, the result was a poor nonthreatening antagonistAs for character casting, Zoe Kravitz is probably the worst Catwoman. Not one Catwoman characteristic was displayed. Might as well get anyone to play Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright was surprisingly a good Jim Gordan although i have no idea when Batman had a partner lol. John Turturro just looks too goofy to pull off as some crazy mob boss/supporting antagonist. Colin Farrell was amazing 👊The greatest detective/tactician failed to do any real detective work. Solved a few riddles and off we go. Bale still #1All in all great production, good acting (especially from Pattison and Farrell). Would I recommend watching it? Yea i guess.

8,This is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans,"The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after ""The Batman"" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Zoë Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).The storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.This movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the ""Detective"" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.Overall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans. I would score this a 7.5- 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",this is magnificent addition super hero genre absolute must see batman fans,batman 2022 is movie my wife i caught advanced screening last night storyline follows gotham shortly after batman has emerged established himself streets serial killer known as riddler starts killing spree everyone influential within gothams hierarchy until bruce wayne inevitably target how are all these people tied together can batman tie pieces together before wayne is next victim this movie is directed by matt reeves cloverfield stars robert pattinson twilight zo kravitz kimi colin farrell total recall paul dano there will be blood john turturro do right thing peter sarsgaard garden state andy serkis lord rings jeffrey wright shaft barry keoghan eternals storyline look feel this movie is characters are perfectly cast well executed farrell dano kravitz were 10 10 this movie does fantastic job depicting batman universe with appropriate grit feel lighting cinematography is excellent this also did good job creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within storyline at end this has very good jeph loeb comics feel it does good job delivering detective elements batman violence was also brilliant very well done i will say this did not need be 3 hours there are abundance scenes that could have been better edited this film likely should have been hair under 2 half hours overall this is magnificent addition super hero genre absolute must see batman fans i would score this 7 5 8 10 strongly recommend it,0.6295391705069125,0.336152073732719,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.4}"
2,First Batman to Make Me Yawn,"I wanted to love this movie. I would have settled for hating it. Instead, I was bored for three hours.The movie is a sloppy buffet of darkness, rain, gloom, unnecessary narration, wooden acting, absurd dialogue, pointless characters, canyon-wide plot-holes, unresolved story arcs, flaccid motivation for the bad guys, hyper-fast cuts, eye-rolling detective work, conventionally choreographed fight scenes, a cinematic emo aesthetic, a pseudo-Gothic mis en scene, a complete lack of humor or light-hearted moments of any kind, no soul in the acting, unsophisticated writing, timid directing, and a fully-checked list of boxes from the superhero / vigilante cliche playbook.This is a partial list of my complaints. (If pressed, I could probably find a handful of good things to say, but they'd be far too inconsequential to bail this movie out of the depths of Meh.)Having grown up on Adam West's Batman, I've lived through the campiness, the avant-garde, the silly, the surreal, and the downright brilliant (I'm looking at you Dark Knight). There have been Batman movies I've loved and ones I've hated. There are some Batman movies my family and I quote and admire and others we make fun of while we re-watch them to revel in their captivating absurdity. This is the first Batman iteration where I was disappointed, bordering on offended at the completely pedestrian effort and the unimaginative, forgettable final product.If you're under thirteen years old, a sucker for three hours of tedious brooding, and if you don't have a bone-deep familiarity with and love of the genre, you *might* enjoy this. Otherwise, if you're a superhero fan and a true movie lover, please please please steer clear of this one!",first batman make me yawn,i wanted love this movie i would have settled hating it instead i was bored three hours movie is sloppy buffet darkness rain gloom unnecessary narration wooden acting absurd dialogue pointless characters canyon wide plot holes unresolved story arcs flaccid motivation bad guys hyper fast cuts eye rolling detective work conventionally choreographed fight scenes cinematic emo aesthetic pseudo gothic mis en scene complete lack humor or light hearted moments any kind no soul acting unsophisticated writing timid directing fully checked list boxes superhero vigilante cliche playbook this is partial list my complaints if pressed i could probably find handful good things say but theyd be far too inconsequential bail this movie out depths meh having grown up adam wests batman ive lived through campiness avant garde silly surreal downright brilliant im looking at you dark knight there have been batman movies ive loved ones ive hated there are some batman movies my family i quote admire others we make fun while we re watch them revel their captivating absurdity this is first batman iteration where i was disappointed bordering offended at completely pedestrian effort unimaginative forgettable final product if youre under thirteen years old sucker three hours tedious brooding if you dont have bone deep familiarity with love genre you might enjoy this otherwise if youre superhero fan true movie lover please please please steer clear this one,0.5774916943521594,0.010631229235880403,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
