9,Celebrate your Freedom ...,"Paint It Yellow. Oops.that's suppose to be Rang De Basanti.. Well that's exactly the director tries to convey. Its about today, us and our present, yet the similarities we have from the Pre-independence era. The Gen-x who knows Mac-D but still prefers the Dhaba Paranthas with sweet Lassi. However they restrict their national values only to food and nothing more. Its not a run of the mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs, couple of foreign locales and then finally some emotional drama.. No no no.. Rang Deis a Cult movie. It is more of an introspection, a food for our thought process. It makes us think, as to how should we actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator, ""I thought there are 2 types of people in the world, one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre, people who go laughing"". That says it all Rang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast. However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema, he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks (Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai ), and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this, both technically and on the part of the actor.The movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today's youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today's world is far ahead of all that, they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upside-down altogether.The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R. Rehman doesn't need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.The brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate, he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle (which is now part of his every new movie) gives a very striking combination.Well the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent, it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked half-baked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.Rang De  is for sure a must watch movie, it doesn't have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it ""There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them"". I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility, lets Paint It Yellow",celebrate your freedom,paint it yellow oops thats suppose be rang de basanti well thats exactly director tries convey its about today us our present yet similarities we have pre independence era gen x who knows mac d but still prefers dhaba paranthas with sweet lassi however they restrict their national values only food nothing more its not run mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs couple foreign locales then finally some emotional drama no no no rang de is cult movie it is more introspection food our thought process it makes us think as how should we actually celebrate our freedom i was really moved by some ending lines by narrator i thought there are 2 types people world one who die crying other who move away silence but today i learned there is third genre people who go laughing that says it all rang de is definitely very brave innovative attempt by director that matter he has selected near perfect cast however veterans like om puri anupam kher looked disposed all characters grow gradually film make you think their way everyone is given enough space justify their talent rakesh omprakash mehra is director new emerging indian cinema he always tries bring something very different i was really impressed by his last attempt 2001 aks amitabh bachchan manoj bajpai he definitely has succeeded making another fabulous master piece highlight movie is great use cinematography techniques its probably first time indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such great effect way each character gradually immerses into scenes past leaves you fantasizing about hard work that has gone background create this both technically part actor movie starts very high spirit reflecting todays youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good history chapters todays world is far ahead all that they would prefer go boozing dancing rather than thinking any those lines way campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down memory lanes beautiful college days this is followed by some intriguing drama events which turns life group buddies upside down altogether film grows you gradually director has made sure that there is clear message everything he presents even group boys represents different sects society religion hence creating appeal everyone watching it music is another high point show its foot tapping very much with mood subject songs give you sense freedom within freedom think ones own way r rehman doesnt need any introductions he is surely one most original music directors we have country brilliance aamir khan is something very difficult narrate he has proved it umpteen number times that he is truly most versatile actor industry his comic timing first part is better than anything seen recent past he is extremely fluent even with difficult punjabi tongue twisters acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult match by anyone around he appears so natural his complete look with new hairstyle which is now part his every new movie gives very striking combination well most wanting part whole thing has been script certain extent it appears very loose second half at times gives droning feel few new ideas presented by author looked half baked however it has been technical expertise director who managed save things with some outstanding camera work editing rang de is sure must watch movie it doesnt have any preaching but still it will force you think once as they say it there are two primary choices life accept conditions as they exist or take upon responsibility change them i believe most us want bring about changes without doing anything so its time think again folks take some responsibility lets paint it yellow,0.5107771156947626,0.16747014684661746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10,"More Than A Wake-up Call, A Thought Provoking Movie For Our Times","If I wait any more to say all the things I want to say about this great soul-stirring movie I will never be able to say it.It is the best use of the film medium that I have seen in a long long time.Here in the west we have virtually abandoned good cinema.Where are our Capras,our Wilders, our Hitchcocks, our David Leans? We make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten.To put it very bluntly, we make utter trash.Good work in the world is being done elsewhere, especially in India where a Bhansali stretches the limits of cinematic expression, where a new Wilder emerges in the shape of Anees Bazmee, where Shaad Ali springs a surprise with a Bunty Aur Bubbly,where out of nowhere comes a Guru Dutt in the garb of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and takes us to a new level of awareness and self-discovery through cinema in a stunning masterpiece called Rang De Basanti.I challenge anyone to name a film made anywhere in the last fifteen years or so to hold a candle to this one.It is simply awesome.As an entertainer it is superb, as purposeful film it goes even further.As a fearless, bold crusader for just causes it is beyond compare.The whole team deserves to be congratulated.Apart from the tremendous contribution made by the writers and the director of the movie, the people who need to be singled out and applauded for the high quality of their work are Aamir Khan(his best role yet),Soha Ali Khan(who finally claims our attention with this role and is destined to be as distinguished as her mother Sharmila Tagore). Waheeda Rehman makes you feel that Guru Dutt is back directing her from heaven.Kirron Kher who is improving with every picture.And all the boys from Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni.All have turned in amazing performances.After Devdas and Munna Bhai MBBS, Binod Pradhan has once again shown that as an ace cameraman he is second to none.And what can you say about A.R. Rahman?This time he even sings like a pro.He is paired here for the first time with Prasoon Joshi who makes you think of Majrooh Sultanpuri.But before I forget, I must mention Alice Patten. She is a joy to behold.And she makes a great pair with Aamir.The film does not have a single dull moment in it.It can be repeated again and again with increasing returns to the viewer.It is a crossover film and needs to be seen by every one in the world.Its publicity and promotion should be geared to that.It should be sent to every international film festival in the world and should be India's entry to the Oscars this year.",more than wake up call thought provoking movie our times,if i wait any more say all things i want say about this great soul stirring movie i will never be able say it it is best use film medium that i have seen long long time here west we have virtually abandoned good cinema where are our capras our wilders our hitchcocks our david leans we make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten put it very bluntly we make utter trash good work world is being done elsewhere especially india where bhansali stretches limits cinematic expression where new wilder emerges shape anees bazmee where shaad ali springs surprise with bunty aur bubbly where out nowhere comes guru dutt garb rakeysh omprakash mehra takes us new level awareness self discovery through cinema stunning masterpiece called rang de basanti i challenge anyone name film made anywhere last fifteen years or so hold candle this one it is simply awesome as entertainer it is superb as purposeful film it goes even further as fearless bold crusader just causes it is beyond compare whole team deserves be congratulated apart tremendous contribution made by writers director movie people who need be singled out applauded high quality their work are aamir khan his best role yet soha ali khan who finally claims our attention with this role is destined be as distinguished as her mother sharmila tagore waheeda rehman makes you feel that guru dutt is back directing her heaven kirron kher who is improving with every picture all boys kunal kapoor atul kulkarni all have turned amazing performances after devdas munna bhai mbbs binod pradhan has once again shown that as ace cameraman he is second none what can you say about r rahman this time he even sings like pro he is paired here first time with prasoon joshi who makes you think majrooh sultanpuri but before i forget i must mention alice patten she is joy behold she makes great pair with aamir film does not have single dull moment it it can be repeated again again with increasing returns viewer it is crossover film needs be seen by every one world its publicity promotion should be geared that it should be sent every international film festival world should be indias entry oscars this year,0.527286951144094,0.33389424860853445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10,Film Review- Rang De Basanti- India Awakens,"Film ReviewRang De BasantiIndia AwakensBy Nidhi KathuriaRating *****'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go', this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a cliché patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career's best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What 'Mangal Pandey' couldn't do for Aamir Khan, 'Rang De Basanti' does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn't have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her 'pucca Punjaban' character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called 'Young Guns of India' based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled 'Rang De Basanti'. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of 'Mangal Pandey' completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that's what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours' souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.The Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia's fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever.

10,A must see for young India,"The movie released today after a lot of hype and controversies. I went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the Indian film industry (of which I am not a fan). What I got was something so very different from what I had envisioned. The humor,the clichés, the nonchalance of youth, the culture, religion,politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. The storyline though is stretched a bit (we Indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. While this movie is definitely not Kurasawa or Satyajit Ray, it is one of the few movies from India which I feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. A movie not to be missed.",must see young india,movie released today after lot hype controversies i went see it expecting it be little different standard escapist fantasies churned out by indian film industry which i am not fan what i got was something so very different what i had envisioned humor clich s nonchalance youth culture religion politics are all there best part is that it works storyline though is stretched bit we indians need that but message is loud clear throughout movie great sense humor is maintained performances are all excellent i have given this movie rating 10 solely basis originality story while this movie is definitely not kurasawa or satyajit ray it is one few movies india which i feel will appeal both mainstream discerning audiences movie not be missed,0.47025641025641024,0.20480769230769227,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,At Last,"It's about time there has been a Bollywood film about the youth of India. Granted these are college kids and not the average Indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education for work, they are a good representatives of young Indians both in the diaspora and in India.Casting is great. Each character pursues their emotion, when their emotions are pursued by circumstances. They express both the emotions at surface and those sunken to be brought out by a situational tide. And they do it with truthfulness. Although some of the elder cast could have been utilized more, the focus on the youth and parallels with past figures are well orchestrated. The character that plays Bhagat Singh, Amir Khan, and Sonia are incredible. Each has their own spotlight where they nudge us from complacency and create an unstable sense of urgency.This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen, this movie has shown the progress of film- making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events, but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words, dialogue, and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camera-work that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because, chops or not, these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience.AR Rahman's music captures the reality unbelievably. We have dance numbers, but they're pathetic belligerent kicking and hand waving. Isn't that what we usually do when we're drunk anyways? Although the use of the music is off sometimes and abrupt, the emotion that each peace carries relates so well to the circumstances. The best use, in my opinion, being Luka Chuppi by Lata M and AR Rahman. The symbiosis between the lyrics and the events on screen are incredible. Dramatic irony at it's best.The cinematography of this film is great in the majority of the film. The few annoyances in cinematography come with the patchy scenes with the first half during these ""leisure"" rides and early in the second half. But, besides that - the cinematographer and director have made outstanding use of the diagonal view. The lines and profiles of people and country are so well placed that you begin to understand how crooked life's path can be. None of us have a straight line ahead of us. What makes me enjoy the movie the most is the humor and cause. You'd think with all the aforementioned details that this is a sobering movie about crooked lives and emotions and such, but the characters have fun. Sue's project is hilarious and the use of extras was really earnest. It is very much how I would be acting with friends, of course only when drunk like they are in certain parts. The cause is very important to this film and it makes it a powerful film because it has this cause.I'm 22. I just recently visited India. I understood and was confused by the youth of India and this film portrays the ambiguity of India well. There are no answers, there are only actions. And this is what they strive to do in the film. Usually Bollywood movies lose their purpose come the 1st dance number, but the truth of this film speaks more than numbers. It is a film about what comes after pure, white innocence of our youth. And it asks that we paint the difference.",at last,its about time there has been bollywood film about youth india granted these are college kids not average indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education work they are good representatives young indians both diaspora india casting is great each character pursues their emotion when their emotions are pursued by circumstances they express both emotions at surface those sunken be brought out by situational tide they do it with truthfulness although some elder cast could have been utilized more focus youth parallels with past figures are well orchestrated character that plays bhagat singh amir khan sonia are incredible each has their own spotlight where they nudge us complacency create unstable sense urgency this is best screenplay i have seen thus far indian media although black had great language through what we saw screen this movie has shown progress film making abroad finally depth character development we need are supplied with not just turn events but turn screen we dont need just words understand character this movie shows how well change scene isnt transition but entity that holds together character emotion repetition repetition words dialogue attitude through parallels was very inspiring general storyline movie is good i say good because parts youths leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as camera work that accompanies it at times i wanted push film forward get point but thats point point being that we need understand choppy nature first half because chops or not these characters are transient figures who dont realize their role life until they have experienced wholeness reality its interesting that wholeness comes reflections past use reuse certain scenes are important showing character growth built upon experience ar rahmans music captures reality unbelievably we have dance numbers but theyre pathetic belligerent kicking hand waving isnt that what we usually do when were drunk anyways although use music is off sometimes abrupt emotion that each peace carries relates so well circumstances best use my opinion being luka chuppi by lata m ar rahman symbiosis between lyrics events screen are incredible dramatic irony at its best cinematography this film is great majority film few annoyances cinematography come with patchy scenes with first half during these leisure rides early second half but besides that cinematographer director have made outstanding use diagonal view lines profiles people country are so well placed that you begin understand how crooked lifes path can be none us have straight line ahead us what makes me enjoy movie most is humor cause youd think with all aforementioned details that this is sobering movie about crooked lives emotions such but characters have fun sues project is hilarious use extras was really earnest it is very much how i would be acting with friends course only when drunk like they are certain parts cause is very important this film it makes it powerful film because it has this cause im 22 i just recently visited india i understood was confused by youth india this film portrays ambiguity india well there are no answers there are only actions this is what they strive do film usually bollywood movies lose their purpose come 1st dance number but truth this film speaks more than numbers it is film about what comes after pure white innocence our youth it asks that we paint difference,0.5359488795518209,0.18268907563025208,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.4}"

7,About the lessons history teaches us,"A British documentary filmmaker gets denied her funding at the last minute. But she has already sacrificed so much for the film, believing strongly in it. It is after all based on a story left to her by her grandfather. So she packs her bags and travels to India to film the documentary even without the help of her studio. There she recruits a bunch of college students to play the key parts and slowly introduces them to the history of their own country, which they have so far dismissed as corrupted and beyond salvation.What I liked about this film the most is how it juggles its storytelling. We see the young rebels fighting for India's freedom, so in essence the film jumps between two timelines. But it's all channeled through the documentary. The college students play the characters and we're every now and then reminded that this is indeed a film. Which ties it all together very nicely.The acting is also topnotch. Aamir Khan is as great as always, but all the rest of the main actors are also superb, and varied in the characters they're portraying. This film speaks strongly for an inclusive and all-encompassing India, and it does it well.I was also surprised by the direction the plot takes. I cannot really speak about it without spoiling it, but suffice to say that the film takes a rather dramatic and even dark turn near the end of the second act. And it's a better film for it. Sure, there will be people that won't like it, believing that the film glorifies this kind of action, but I don't think the film makers intended it that way.Strong film and one of the better Hindi movies I've seen so far.",about lessons history teaches us,british documentary filmmaker gets denied her funding at last minute but she has already sacrificed so much film believing strongly it it is after all based story left her by her grandfather so she packs her bags travels india film documentary even without help her studio there she recruits bunch college students play key parts slowly introduces them history their own country which they have so far dismissed as corrupted beyond salvation what i liked about this film most is how it juggles its storytelling we see young rebels fighting indias freedom so essence film jumps between two timelines but its all channeled through documentary college students play characters were every now then reminded that this is indeed film which ties it all together very nicely acting is also topnotch aamir khan is as great as always but all rest main actors are also superb varied characters theyre portraying this film speaks strongly inclusive all encompassing india it does it well i was also surprised by direction plot takes i cannot really speak about it without spoiling it but suffice say that film takes rather dramatic even dark turn near end second act its better film it sure there will be people that wont like it believing that film glorifies this kind action but i dont think film makers intended it that way strong film one better hindi movies ive seen so far,0.486026936026936,0.2176767676767676,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10,Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant,"Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.It would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.The balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense.

8,Rekindling the patriotic spirits of their forefathers in a bunch of spoiled jerks.,"Sue is a pretty young British lady who wants to make a film about the Indian uprising of the 1920s. This is because she's read through her grandfather's diary and although he was a British officer, he had great respect for these Indian patriots. But her bosses have no interest in such a project (perhaps because she's in the UK), so she takes off for India to do the film herself...with no funding. But because there is no money, she decides to use some college students instead of professional actors. There is a huge problem, though, as the students are mostly very spoiled young people who are more interested in becoming like Westerners than doing a serious film about their forefathers. Can she get through to these jerks and get them to realize the great price that was paid to create modern day India....and thus get the film made?Like most Indian films, this one is quite long--nearly three hours. And, like a typical Indian film is shows a lot of fun-loving young Indians singing and dancing. I liked the film but think they overdid this aspect a bit. The students should have been oblivious to their past but making them annoying jerks seemed a bit too much, as it was very hard to like any of them during the first portion of the picture. A bit more subtlety would have been nice. Fortunately, through the course of the film, the students did improve in this regard and began to take the project more seriously. This later portion was much better and poignant, as the students start to realize that even today in India there is corruption and repression that must be fought and it's a close parallel to the story about the Indian revolutionaries of the 1920s. I am pretty sure the Indian politicians did NOT appreciate this film and its condemnation of brutal police tactics to squelch protest! Overall, despite being uneven, the film is quite good and interesting as it seems to encourage what might be perceived as terrorism! A very compelling film despite the slow start.By the way, the MiG-21 crashes which made up a significant part of the latter portion of film have apparently been a serious problem in India. And yet, the film says at the beginning that it's a work of fiction...interesting. Also, for Westerners not used to Bollywood films, you might be interested to hear that corruption (particularly police corruption) is a relatively common theme in Indian films.",rekindling patriotic spirits their forefathers bunch spoiled jerks,sue is pretty young british lady who wants make film about indian uprising 1920s this is because shes read through her grandfathers diary although he was british officer he had great respect these indian patriots but her bosses have no interest such project perhaps because shes uk so she takes off india do film herself with no funding but because there is no money she decides use some college students instead professional actors there is huge problem though as students are mostly very spoiled young people who are more interested becoming like westerners than doing serious film about their forefathers can she get through these jerks get them realize great price that was paid create modern day india thus get film made like most indian films this one is quite long nearly three hours like typical indian film is shows lot fun loving young indians singing dancing i liked film but think they overdid this aspect bit students should have been oblivious their past but making them annoying jerks seemed bit too much as it was very hard like any them during first portion picture bit more subtlety would have been nice fortunately through course film students did improve this regard began take project more seriously this later portion was much better poignant as students start realize that even today india there is corruption repression that must be fought its close parallel story about indian revolutionaries 1920s i am pretty sure indian politicians did not appreciate this film its condemnation brutal police tactics squelch protest overall despite being uneven film is quite good interesting as it seems encourage what might be perceived as terrorism very compelling film despite slow start by way mig 21 crashes which made up significant part latter portion film have apparently been serious problem india yet film says at beginning that its work fiction interesting also westerners not used bollywood films you might be interested hear that corruption particularly police corruption is relatively common theme indian films,0.5002628968253969,0.15822916666666664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.22}"

Excellent screenplay too. There are certain instances where the screen has more than one event being focused at. This makes the movie more natural and easy to relate to.

10,Mohe Tu Rang De Basanti....(Colour Me Yellow),"Warning: This is not a movie for he faint hearted or for escapists looking for brainless entertainment.But if you belong to neither of those categories then this one's for you. As a viewer, I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Sure Aamkir Khan was known for quality cinema and all but Mangal Pandey had come as a huge disappointment and I was thinking that this would follow the same lines. Thankfully, I was wrong.One of the most different movies ever seen on the Indian Screen, it is a novel experience for the average moviegoer. One cannot really categorize this movie as Action or Romance or Patriotic etc. However, it falls under one category perfectly: Cult. This movie is sure to achieve Cult status especially among the youth. It has scenes from the lives of Bhagat Singh and other Revolutionaries (the sepia tone give it a really authentic feel) as well as the state of the current youth. But what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes a successful comparative study between the Incidents and Events in the Lives of our Pre-Independence Heroes and the Lives of the Modern Youth of India. As this comparison is brought out (especially in the Post-Interval Portions), it makes your skin crawl. Also the climax is an exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions. The Story: Sue (Alice Patton in an extremely commendable role) is a British girl who wants to make a movie on Indian Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad on the basis of the experiences of her grandfather who was an Officer in British India. Due to shortage of money she convinces a mix bag of college students and slackers to act in her movie (Aamir, Siddharth, Sharman Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor. While making the movie, she becomes good friends with them and even gets smitten with D.J. (Aamir).Now these guys have a friend who is an Air Force Pilot (R. Madhavan) whose MiG crashes due to its faulty parts. The entire group is devastated. What angers them further is the Defence Minister's (Mohan Agashe) accusation that the pilot was an amateur. But what really pushes them to the edge is when the Police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man, woman or child. They decide to take revenge....By killing the Defence Minister. When they succeed in their endeavour, they are shocked to find the Minister being called a Martyr ad being awarded the Bharat Ratna. They decide tat the country needs to know the truth. For this, they take over an All India Radio Station to announce the truth over the radio. What follows is the tense climax that keeps the viewers guessing till the very end.Analysis: The movie has been treated in a very contemporary manner. The dialogues have been penned beautifully. The script is tight. If the first half is filled with light moments then the second half has its share serious scenes. The Punjabi Dialogues come as a breath of fresh air.Apart from the main story, there are a number of sub-plots that are included that raise many issues. Be it the views of a Hindu Fundamentalist about Muslims or the views of a Muslim of the treatment given to his community in the country, it makes the viewer think. There is also the love story between Soha Ali Khan and R. Madhavan as well as the controversy regarding the faulty parts in the MiG airplanes purchased by India and the money made by selfish industrialist (Anupam Kher...wasted) and Ministers. The Music is Excellent. After a hiatus we see A.R. Rahman in full form. The Title Track gives the viewer a sense of elation and the colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more. Also other songs like 'Tu Bin Bataye', 'Paathshala', 'LukaChhupi' and 'Roobaroo' leave an impact on you.Full Marks to Rakesh MEhra for the treatment of the subject. There are a number of scenes that give you chills like:1) D.J.'s breakdown at Sue's house after returning from the hospital. 2) Madhavan's last remains brought to his house for his mother and friends. 3) Atul Kulkarni's delivery of the poem 'Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna' as Ramprasad Bismil. 4) the Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre sequence with replacing the Defence Miniter for General Dyer to explain its contemporary relevance.However, what really makes this movie a true accomplishment is the performances. All of the above would be non-existent if it wasn't for the stellar performance given by the entire cast. Aamir Khan is excellent as the care free Punjabi, but he doesn't steal all the attention. He is supported by equally riveting performances by Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni. Soha Ali Khan is a revelation compared to her prior films. Her breakdown on hearing of Madhavan's death is one on the most amazing scenes from the movie. Alice Patton is equally good. Her Hindi is sure to strike a chord with the Indian cinegoers. Also, absolutely amazing performances come from Waheedaji and Kirronji. Both lend brilliant support to the movie. One the whole, this movie is a novel experience. A definite recommendation to every youth of India as well as the World. It is a movie that gives you fodder for thought. Also, it is one of those few movies that actually lives up to its tagline: A Generation Awakens.",mohe tu rang de basanti colour me yellow,warning this is not movie he faint hearted or escapists looking brainless entertainment but if you belong neither those categories then this ones you as viewer i didnt know what expect movie sure aamkir khan was known quality cinema all but mangal pandey had come as huge disappointment i was thinking that this would follow same lines thankfully i was wrong one most different movies ever seen indian screen it is novel experience average moviegoer one cannot really categorize this movie as action or romance or patriotic etc however it falls under one category perfectly cult this movie is sure achieve cult status especially among youth it has scenes lives bhagat singh other revolutionaries sepia tone give it really authentic feel as well as state current youth but what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes successful comparative study between incidents events lives our pre independence heroes lives modern youth india as this comparison is brought out especially post interval portions it makes your skin crawl also climax is exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions story sue alice patton extremely commendable role is british girl who wants make movie indian revolutionaries like bhagat singh chandrashekhar azad basis experiences her grandfather who was officer british india due shortage money she convinces mix bag college students slackers act her movie aamir siddharth sharman soha ali khan atul kulkarni kunal kapoor while making movie she becomes good friends with them even gets smitten with d j aamir now these guys have friend who is air force pilot r madhavan whose mig crashes due its faulty parts entire group is devastated what angers them further is defence ministers mohan agashe accusation that pilot was amateur but what really pushes them edge is when police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man woman or child they decide take revenge by killing defence minister when they succeed their endeavour they are shocked find minister being called martyr ad being awarded bharat ratna they decide tat country needs know truth this they take over all india radio station announce truth over radio what follows is tense climax that keeps viewers guessing till very end analysis movie has been treated very contemporary manner dialogues have been penned beautifully script is tight if first half is filled with light moments then second half has its share serious scenes punjabi dialogues come as breath fresh air apart main story there are number sub plots that are included that raise many issues be it views hindu fundamentalist about muslims or views muslim treatment given his community country it makes viewer think there is also love story between soha ali khan r madhavan as well as controversy regarding faulty parts mig airplanes purchased by india money made by selfish industrialist anupam kher wasted ministers music is excellent after hiatus we see r rahman full form title track gives viewer sense elation colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more also other songs like tu bin bataye paathshala lukachhupi roobaroo leave impact you full marks rakesh mehra treatment subject there are number scenes that give you chills like 1 d j s breakdown at sues house after returning hospital 2 madhavans last remains brought his house his mother friends 3 atul kulkarnis delivery poem sarfaroshi ki tamanna as ramprasad bismil 4 jalianwalah bagh massacre sequence with replacing defence miniter general dyer explain its contemporary relevance however what really makes this movie true accomplishment is performances all above would be non existent if it wasnt stellar performance given by entire cast aamir khan is excellent as care free punjabi but he doesnt steal all attention he is supported by equally riveting performances by siddharth kunal kapoor sharman joshi atul kulkarni soha ali khan is revelation compared her prior films her breakdown hearing madhavans death is one most amazing scenes movie alice patton is equally good her hindi is sure strike chord with indian cinegoers also absolutely amazing performances come waheedaji kirronji both lend brilliant support movie one whole this movie is novel experience definite recommendation every youth india as well as world it is movie that gives you fodder thought also it is one those few movies that actually lives up its tagline generation awakens,0.5159925415949511,0.17746701090074585,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
3,Yet another overrated mess badly skewed by Indian IMDb users,"""Rang De Basanti"" directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is about a woman who wants to depict the freedom fighters from 1920's India in a documentary.

It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message, and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences, ministers, corruption, unemployment, etc...Yet, rarely any one steps up to change what's wrong, and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society, and change what is erroneous. EVerything about this movie is just absolutely unique - the screenplay, the colors, the performances, the songs...EVERYTHING. All actors played their roles top-notch. Every actor had an impact in the movie, and should've received equal credit from my perspective. Amir, Sharman, Siddharth, Kunal, Atul, Soha, Waheeda, every one stepped up to the plate. Some actors were over looked,such as Alice Patten and Sharman Joshi. Alice had dedication towards her work - her Hindi was very well fluent, and so were her expressions. Sharman did a great job acting innocently comic. Soha's reaction after Ajay's death was natural - she fitted into the very skin of her character. Siddharth is a fantastic actor, and hopefully will make it big in Bollywood one day, he handled his character to the maximum level. Amir, as usual, did not disappoint. He was awesome, and very authentic. The movie was modern - so today, and it was something that we can easily relate to. Honestly, when I first purchased the movie last year, I thought it was an over-rated movie just because of Amir Khan's comeback; nonetheless, after watching it, I was proved wrong. It was just ""wow"", beyond words. I couldn't manage not to cry at the end. THe quotes in the movie were just lovely, and has the possession of very deep meanings.Overall, this movie deserves a 10, without any questioning. It is a message to the youth of the present era. Get out there - change the negative aspects of the world. This movie DOES NOT ONLY GO FOR INDIANS, however all other countries in south Asia, which contains issues such as corruption, over population, and so forth. I am a Bengali, and the movie impressed me as much as any Indian - because the situations in Bangladesh is alike. Ministers are stealing the country's money, and they are not caring about the people, or doing anything to improve the country. People suffer each day - due to their very actions.

6,Good message. Stupid film.,"Now all of us should commend RdB for the bold initiative in putting forth the idea of what the common citizen of India would like to do to every..cough...democratically elected...cough...politician. The movie was quite influential to the point that the political scum really need to worry about their safety. Having said all that, there is really nothing in this movie itself besides that which is worth mentioning. Its the standard Bollywood fare of singing, dancing, religion related fighting and a look at the past freedom struggle from the British.

8,None of the 2-hour-45minute is wasted in this strong movie,"The story opens up very strongly with those kinds of scenes. It continues on to build up its story in a softer tone and quite literally from scratch. It's a surprise for me this movie actually presents two separate conflicts altogether. What's great about this is that the movie has all its significant characters developed deep enough to mean something in the eyes of the viewers. This is very much true that when the second conflict arrives, it doesn't really need much more duration in building up its content's suspense. What I appreciate even more is that unlike other Indian movies this movie sure uses its duration to the maximum point, reducing the duration of the songs up to minimum. Most of the songs even contain some heavy detail scenes, forcing the viewers, especially those on digital media, not to skip the songs. It's also nice that this movie contains a little bit of assorting genres such as a little bit of action, thriller, and of course romance beside all the heavy drama. The acting side is quite a standard Indian piece, but it can hold as it has a great execution of a great story.",none 2 hour 45minute is wasted this strong movie,story opens up very strongly with those kinds scenes it continues build up its story softer tone quite literally scratch its surprise me this movie actually presents two separate conflicts altogether whats great about this is that movie has all its significant characters developed deep enough mean something eyes viewers this is very much true that when second conflict arrives it doesnt really need much more duration building up its contents suspense what i appreciate even more is that unlike other indian movies this movie sure uses its duration maximum point reducing duration songs up minimum most songs even contain some heavy detail scenes forcing viewers especially those digital media not skip songs its also nice that this movie contains little bit assorting genres such as little bit action thriller course romance beside all heavy drama acting side is quite standard indian piece but it can hold as it has great execution great story,0.4842921146953405,0.18416666666666665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10,"One of the finest movie of this generation. It's not a movie, it's a movement.","One of the finest movie of this generation. It's not a movie, it's a movement.We were 13-14 friends who went to see this in Shiva theatre (dilsukhnagar, hyderabad) on Jan 26th 2006. It was Kranthi, Rutwik, Venkat, Raghuveer, Manthan, Anirudh, Dinackar, Satish among those whom I can recollect. Now, the film began rolling, Kranthi who was next to me said, what movie have we come to, there is Bhagat Singh reading his diary and it was a sepia shot. Before, this I got the CD and was is love with the music of the film, I thought it would be youthful, dreamy and completely joyful. The title too seemed be inapt when I just heard the music. Then the film began on its course and as the watch fell and titles began to roll, we got a glimpse of what we were about to witness in the titles itself. I must say, till this date I have liked no other titles as this one and the background music by A R Rahman, he put al his genius into it. We were all happy then itself. We got into characters, there was Aslam, DJ, Karan, Sukhi Ram, Laxman Pandey and Ajay and also Sue (Su Kar Mere Mann Ko) all the right chords were touched in casting and we also had the legendray Waheeda Rehman play Ajay's mother and other good actors in the roles of mothers and fathers. The story was about Su coming to India to make a film on our lost and forgotten freedom fighters. Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and others. It was paced as if we are told the whole revoultionary story in the most enaging way possible. Indeed, that is the only way we relate to this, there is a need for freedom in one way, at least the Gandhian way is not working now so let's try the Bhagat Singh way. We may die but yet we shall die happily. If there is any film that has made me believe in myself more and to fight for what I believe is right, then this is the film. What DJ stood for what he believed in though he could not believe it in the first place. Laxman is a symbol of the uncorrupt youth who are being dragged into partisan politics and being corrupted. Karan is the cool dude who worries about rich gear and not about this country much. Aslam is the poet who has a big heart and a brave vision. I loved them all and thanks to the writer director Rakesh Mehra for bringing them on all alive, not just as friends but as the freedom fighters whom I wish not to forget. Revolution is what I strived for since I saw this, and most of it is exhibited in the office job where I am a warrior of nothing but honesty and truth. I love them both (truth and honesty) and this film did show that to me. Getting back to the movie, so by the time we were at interval. None of us moved no one grabbed a drink or popcorn, we were in love with what we saying but were thinking and talking where this is going to lead. Raghu said ""Cinematography super"" Rutwik said ""I like Karan"" the film began post interval and all were glued again. When a tragedy struck and when Lukka Chuppi played, I was having tears and just could not imagine that such a beautiful song was written for such great tragedy. A mother has lost her son and Lukka Chuppi is what it is, hide and seek. I feel numbness in my fingers even as I type this now, then we got Khoon Chala, now the time has come to overpower all our politicians, and these guys just tried to do that at the end and what a tragedy has struck them. They became martyrs. The movie ended, we were struck to our seats, Venkat said, now let's leave. We started walking slowly and got onto our bikes and went to Raghuveer's home. From the time we left the theatre till we reached his home and sit in his room, there was silence, I don't' know why and we were all silent I am sure. Raghu said ""You need something"" and our silence broke. This is how vividly I can imagine the whole experience of Jan 26th 006. I just can't forget that. This movie did lot many things to us on that day at least I am sure and I believe most of us still have this feeling at the back of their mind. I just am so thankful for the makers, the actors and very crew man of this wonderful movie. I can't even rate this, but a 5/5 for what it did. Even 6 years later all is very fresh and am still hopeful of doing something. This was the first DVD I bought for myself and am happy that I did. I just can't let go of this movie. It may not the best in cinematic terms maybe as I have heard a mixed opinion down the years, but the screenplay is just awesome and so the background score and cinematography. The songs, the emotion, the poetry. Go watch all of it and I am sure, most of you will love it again.I am sorry if this became more of an autobiography than a movie review, but just wanted to share it.",one finest movie this generation its not movie its movement,one finest movie this generation its not movie its movement we were 13 14 friends who went see this shiva theatre dilsukhnagar hyderabad jan 26th 2006 it was kranthi rutwik venkat raghuveer manthan anirudh dinackar satish among those whom i can recollect now film began rolling kranthi who was next me said what movie have we come there is bhagat singh reading his diary it was sepia shot before this i got cd was is love with music film i thought it would be youthful dreamy completely joyful title too seemed be inapt when i just heard music then film began its course as watch fell titles began roll we got glimpse what we were about witness titles itself i must say till this date i have liked no other titles as this one background music by r rahman he put al his genius into it we were all happy then itself we got into characters there was aslam dj karan sukhi ram laxman pandey ajay also sue su kar mere mann ko all right chords were touched casting we also had legendray waheeda rehman play ajays mother other good actors roles mothers fathers story was about su coming india make film our lost forgotten freedom fighters chandrashekhar azad bhagat singh others it was paced as if we are told whole revoultionary story most enaging way possible indeed that is only way we relate this there is need freedom one way at least gandhian way is not working now so lets try bhagat singh way we may die but yet we shall die happily if there is any film that has made me believe myself more fight what i believe is right then this is film what dj stood what he believed though he could not believe it first place laxman is symbol uncorrupt youth who are being dragged into partisan politics being corrupted karan is cool dude who worries about rich gear not about this country much aslam is poet who has big heart brave vision i loved them all thanks writer director rakesh mehra bringing them all alive not just as friends but as freedom fighters whom i wish not forget revolution is what i strived since i saw this most it is exhibited office job where i am warrior nothing but honesty truth i love them both truth honesty this film did show that me getting back movie so by time we were at interval none us moved no one grabbed drink or popcorn we were love with what we saying but were thinking talking where this is going lead raghu said cinematography super rutwik said i like karan film began post interval all were glued again when tragedy struck when lukka chuppi played i was having tears just could not imagine that such beautiful song was written such great tragedy mother has lost her son lukka chuppi is what it is hide seek i feel numbness my fingers even as i type this now then we got khoon chala now time has come overpower all our politicians these guys just tried do that at end what tragedy has struck them they became martyrs movie ended we were struck our seats venkat said now lets leave we started walking slowly got onto our bikes went raghuveers home time we left theatre till we reached his home sit his room there was silence i dont know why we were all silent i am sure raghu said you need something our silence broke this is how vividly i can imagine whole experience jan 26th 006 i just cant forget that this movie did lot many things us that day at least i am sure i believe most us still have this feeling at back their mind i just am so thankful makers actors very crew man this wonderful movie i cant even rate this but 5 5 what it did even 6 years later all is very fresh am still hopeful doing something this was first dvd i bought myself am happy that i did i just cant let go this movie it may not best cinematic terms maybe as i have heard mixed opinion down years but screenplay is just awesome so background score cinematography songs emotion poetry go watch all it i am sure most you will love it again i am sorry if this became more autobiography than movie review but just wanted share it,0.5350844041320232,0.2710588309397833,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"
