1.0,Just shoot me...,"In what can only be described as the worst movie made in the past decade, Dungeons & Dragons will leave you begging for mercy.Hands down, the biggest contributor to the demise of this movie was the script. It was litterally the most insulting, inane dialogue I have ever been treated to in a movie.Props arrive next in an extremely close second. The 35 Million dollars used to make this film must have been used on late night taco runs, because the quality of the props is abyssmal. The ""prized artifact"" of the movie looks like it fell out of a box of cracker jack, while some of the armor and backgrounds are straight out of the Bargain Bin at your local toy store. Better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot on camcorders across the globe in people's back yards.The acting was terrible all around. The few, and I mean FEW, attempts at serious dialogue were crushed by the worst script ever. The only remotely cool character in the entire proceeding was Demadar, who was still pretty goofy. I guess if I was 8 or so, I might have thought he was creepy. The notably great actors in this film should have balked the moment they saw the script/quality of filming, and their presence on the screen only adds to the insult.Th producers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Hundreds of thousands of loyal D&D fans have been waiting for over 25 years for a great, inspiring movie from their hobby. D&D has a prodigious level of material written about it, and any one of it's 100+ books would have made a better movie if read aloud by Pee Wee Herman.This horror show of a movie will no doubt ensure the demise of a great hobby in the public eye for at least the next 10 years. Any potential fan of the game will be unable to forget this awful movie experience. Consider yourself warned, and never, EVER see this movie.",just shoot me,what can only be described as worst movie made past decade dungeons dragons will leave you begging mercy hands down biggest contributor demise this movie was script it was litterally most insulting inane dialogue i have ever been treated movie props arrive next extremely close second 35 million dollars used make this film must have been used late night taco runs because quality props is abyssmal prized artifact movie looks like it fell out box cracker jack while some armor backgrounds are straight out bargain bin at your local toy store better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot camcorders across globe peoples back yards acting was terrible all around few i mean few attempts at serious dialogue were crushed by worst script ever only remotely cool character entire proceeding was demadar who was still pretty goofy i guess if i was 8 or so i might have thought he was creepy notably great actors this film should have balked moment they saw script quality filming their presence screen only adds insult th producers this movie should be ashamed themselves hundreds thousands loyal d d fans have been waiting over 25 years great inspiring movie their hobby d d has prodigious level material written about it any one its 100 books would have made better movie if read aloud by pee wee herman this horror show movie will no doubt ensure demise great hobby public eye at least next 10 years any potential fan game will be unable forget this awful movie experience consider yourself warned never ever see this movie,0.581382275132275,-0.0629298941798942,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,One of the worst films of 2000,"If there hadn't been a ""Battlefield Earth"", this movie probably would have gotten my vote for worst movie of 2000. The only way it is (slightly) better than that movie is the (very) occasional good set or effect.I could write for hours about what's wrong with this movie, but this is what comes to mind immediately(1) The horrible acting. I honestly can't understand why someone so talented as Jeremy Irons would be going so over the top. It's clear, however, that he isn't enjoying himself in the movie, so maybe he's getting revenge against the movie by acting so terriblyThe most annoying performance goes to Marlon Wayans. His shrieking, cowardly character uncomfortably brings up images of stereotypes from the 1930s. At least he doesn't say ""Feet, do your stuff!"" - though he sure comes close. (2) The bright, glitterly look of every scene. When you think of sword and sorcery, I think we all think of things rough and with grit. Not here.(3) The movie constantly rips off from other (better) movies, most notably from the four STAR WARS movies(4) The characters. Why the hell were the dwarf and elf in this movie? They could easily have been written out without consequence. And the main thief hero is one of the blandest heroes I've ever seen in the movie. (5) Virtually all the special effects, sets etc. are AWFUL. Sometimes they look even worse than those seen on the Xena and Hercules shows! (Though those two shows at least have the excuse of having lower budgets - and they make up for the cheap effects by having better scripts, characters, and acting!)(6) And speaking of scripts...thos script is terrible! Mainly it's because the story itself hardly makes any sense!",one worst films 2000,if there hadnt been battlefield earth this movie probably would have gotten my vote worst movie 2000 only way it is slightly better than that movie is very occasional good set or effect i could write hours about whats wrong with this movie but this is what comes mind immediately 1 horrible acting i honestly cant understand why someone so talented as jeremy irons would be going so over top its clear however that he isnt enjoying himself movie so maybe hes getting revenge against movie by acting so terriblythe most annoying performance goes marlon wayans his shrieking cowardly character uncomfortably brings up images stereotypes 1930s at least he doesnt say feet do your stuff though he sure comes close 2 bright glitterly look every scene when you think sword sorcery i think we all think things rough with grit not here 3 movie constantly rips off other better movies most notably four star wars movies 4 characters why hell were dwarf elf this movie they could easily have been written out without consequence main thief hero is one blandest heroes ive ever seen movie 5 virtually all special effects sets etc are awful sometimes they look even worse than those seen xena hercules shows though those two shows at least have excuse having lower budgets they make up cheap effects by having better scripts characters acting 6 speaking scripts thos script is terrible mainly its because story itself hardly makes any sense,0.58515376984127,0.01142857142857143,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,What a waste,"It is unbelievable how this movie could have been created with such good actors and so much money, but such a bad script and directing.Dialogues are painfully bad in this movie, as is the story itself.The acting is also below any standard you would expect from such an expensive movie. Jeremy Irons was especially shocking, his performance was very pathetic and flat, as if this would be a bad movie for three year olds. That was not acting, that was a torment ! I cried every time he appeared on the screen.Thora Birch was also far, far below her level in 'American Beauty', obviously unable to tell how one should put a little life into her bad dialogue and flat character, and somehow even thinking that that was her own fault.If at all, the thief Snails (Marlon Wayans from Scary Movie) had quite some good moments in his slapstick scenes, the only good moments in the whole movie. Unfortunately they don't last long. Wayans seems to have a talent to shine even in the worst movies, however.The performance of the main actor was also bad. His dull and cheap sunnyboy behavior really nerved me, and I saw absolutely no reason for his 'being special', but far more for 'being untalented'.The effects where better than the story, but really not that exciting either.Some people say fantasy is about stereotypes, but that doesnt mean you can forget all rules how to make up a good story ! This story was not worth getting on the screen. This story was also not worth getting such good actors and effects. This story was nothing but crap !And I can't believe that Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch are such bad actors, they have proven they can do far, far better ! I can only guess it must have been the director who forced them to do such bad performances.Definitely not recommended for anyone except maybe children below ten. Oh wait, they're not allowed ? No loss.",what waste,it is unbelievable how this movie could have been created with such good actors so much money but such bad script directing dialogues are painfully bad this movie as is story itself acting is also below any standard you would expect such expensive movie jeremy irons was especially shocking his performance was very pathetic flat as if this would be bad movie three year olds that was not acting that was torment i cried every time he appeared screen thora birch was also far far below her level american beauty obviously unable tell how one should put little life into her bad dialogue flat character somehow even thinking that that was her own fault if at all thief snails marlon wayans scary movie had quite some good moments his slapstick scenes only good moments whole movie unfortunately they dont last long wayans seems have talent shine even worst movies however performance main actor was also bad his dull cheap sunnyboy behavior really nerved me i saw absolutely no reason his being special but far more being untalented effects where better than story but really not that exciting either some people say fantasy is about stereotypes but that doesnt mean you can forget all rules how make up good story this story was not worth getting screen this story was also not worth getting such good actors effects this story was nothing but crap i cant believe that jeremy irons thora birch are such bad actors they have proven they can do far far better i can only guess it must have been director who forced them do such bad performances definitely not recommended anyone except maybe children below ten oh wait theyre not allowed no loss,0.5589936755952382,-0.07684151785714285,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,"Poor delivery, so-so effects and laughable performances all combine to produce a film that will barely appeal to kids","Ridley and Snails are thieves in the underclass of their world. Breaking into the magic school to steal they are captured by Marina but, when her master is killed, the thieves find themselves drawn into an attempt by the evil Profion to use the power of a lost sceptre to seize control from Empress Savina, who is trying to reform and make all men equal.It is hard to really judge the plot of this film because I'm sure it could have been a rollicking, engaging ""swords & sorcery"" affair and it is only the delivery here that has turned it into a massive, insulting pile of rubbish. The way that the characters have to explain every single action in BIG LETTERS for the audience was something that grated on me and took me from thinking of it as lazy writing to finding it offensive that the writers thought I was too stupid to follow the story myself. Instead of being a strong narrative the film is just a basic adventure for kids, with effects and noise to keep them distracted. As such it is still only so-so because even children might struggle to care about the unimpressive CGI backgrounds and action set pieces. It'll please the very undemanding genre fan under 12 years old but unlikely many others.The characters are another major failing  who thought that writing obnoxious, annoying or smug characters across the leads would cause an audience to be engaged by them? With this to work with, is it any wonder that the cast are roundly poor? Whalin must have thought his luck was in when he landed this role, but he messes it up with a performance that shows he is out of his depth and unsure of himself. McLellan is bland and quite irritating for the majority of the film but her faults pale in comparison to a trio of performances that stick in the mind as the worst of the film. Irons hams it up with all the carelessness of a pro who knows an easy payday when he sees it  he is hilariously terrible at times. Payne's blue lipstick seems to have affected his voice and every line is delivered as a sneer  it is never menacing and quickly becomes tiresome. However the worst performance is form, surprise surprise, Wayans who made me understand what Spike Lee's Bamboozled was getting at. He is a shrieking, mugging ethnic cliché  even worse than he usually does and even more annoying. The odd cameo from O'Brien or Baker do nothing to stop the rot and the cast add to the impression that this was cheaply made without much love.Overall a poor film that will probably only appeal to kids. The plot is badly delivered and the effects are not as impressive as director Solomon was clearly banking on them being. The cast are lost in the middle of it all and not a single on of them gives a performance that you could call ""good"", all in all producing a pretty poor attempt at a blockbuster.",poor delivery so so effects laughable performances all combine produce film that will barely appeal kids,ridley snails are thieves underclass their world breaking into magic school steal they are captured by marina but when her master is killed thieves find themselves drawn into attempt by evil profion use power lost sceptre seize control empress savina who is trying reform make all men equal it is hard really judge plot this film because im sure it could have been rollicking engaging swords sorcery affair it is only delivery here that has turned it into massive insulting pile rubbish way that characters have explain every single action big letters audience was something that grated me took me thinking it as lazy writing finding it offensive that writers thought i was too stupid follow story myself instead being strong narrative film is just basic adventure kids with effects noise keep them distracted as such it is still only so so because even children might struggle care about unimpressive cgi backgrounds action set pieces itll please very undemanding genre fan under 12 years old but unlikely many others characters are another major failing who thought that writing obnoxious annoying or smug characters across leads would cause audience be engaged by them with this work with is it any wonder that cast are roundly poor whalin must have thought his luck was when he landed this role but he messes it up with performance that shows he is out his depth unsure himself mclellan is bland quite irritating majority film but her faults pale comparison trio performances that stick mind as worst film irons hams it up with all carelessness pro who knows easy payday when he sees it he is hilariously terrible at times paynes blue lipstick seems have affected his voice every line is delivered as sneer it is never menacing quickly becomes tiresome however worst performance is form surprise surprise wayans who made me understand what spike lees bamboozled was getting at he is shrieking mugging ethnic clich even worse than he usually does even more annoying odd cameo obrien or baker do nothing stop rot cast add impression that this was cheaply made without much love overall poor film that will probably only appeal kids plot is badly delivered effects are not as impressive as director solomon was clearly banking them being cast are lost middle it all not single them gives performance that you could call good all all producing pretty poor attempt at blockbuster,0.5960687830687832,-0.09513690476190477,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
2.0,"Oh Dear, another fine mess","I have just watched this film for the first time, & can confirm it is worse than what I had heard it was. Now as a rule I don't always take note of reviews of films, even if they are bad, as certain films can be bad & still quite enjoyable, even if the acting & plot are okay. Unfortunately, this is not only all the above, but also pretty tiresome & downright tedious as well.The main unknown (to me anyway) leading threesome are all dreadful & from this showing awful actors as well. Justin Whalin is just laughable & one of the worst heroes in a long while. Probably since Val Kilmers appalling performance in The Saint. Zoe Mclellan is pretty enough (which probably explains away her deficiencies amongst other reviewers) but is still dreadful. The worse though is Marlon Wayons, whose performance is not only awful & completely unfunny, but also of a racist nature. The rest of the actors are also bad, but at least the likes of Jeremy Irons, Bruce Payne & Thora Birch, know they are only slumming it, & are at least decent actors if the material is there.The plot is also weird & ridiculous, with no explanation of what is going on, & the upsetting thing was that the poor dragons couldn't have snacked on the lot of them, which would of at least made it a happy ending, for us & the dragons anyway. If you want to see a well acted & well made fantasy film watch Lord of the Rings instead.",oh dear another fine mess,i have just watched this film first time can confirm it is worse than what i had heard it was now as rule i dont always take note reviews films even if they are bad as certain films can be bad still quite enjoyable even if acting plot are okay unfortunately this is not only all above but also pretty tiresome downright tedious as well main unknown me anyway leading threesome are all dreadful this showing awful actors as well justin whalin is just laughable one worst heroes long while probably since val kilmers appalling performance saint zoe mclellan is pretty enough which probably explains away her deficiencies amongst other reviewers but is still dreadful worse though is marlon wayons whose performance is not only awful completely unfunny but also racist nature rest actors are also bad but at least likes jeremy irons bruce payne thora birch know they are only slumming it are at least decent actors if material is there plot is also weird ridiculous with no explanation what is going upsetting thing was that poor dragons couldnt have snacked lot them which would at least made it happy ending us dragons anyway if you want see well acted well made fantasy film watch lord rings instead,0.6893990929705216,-0.21950113378684813,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"A Charming, Funny, Campy Swords & Sorcery Film With a Big Heart","Of every film that I've fiercely defended, this one may be the most widely reviled. It sports a 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, a 1.5 on Letterboxd and a 3.7 on IMDb. Many critics have called it one of the worst films of all time. What brought them to that conclusion? Honestly, I couldn't tell you. As an avid fan of both 80s Swords & Sorcery flicks, as well as the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop RPG, I found Dungeons & Dragons 2000 to be a surprisingly heartfelt and well made fantasy film. It's campy, but intentionally and enjoyably so, and I can only imagine how fun it must have been to shoot.Obviously, Dungeons & Dragons 2000 is no Empire Strikes Back. It has its flaws. While most of the cast seems to be having the time of their lives, the one party pooper seems to be Thora Birch as Empress Savina. The worst thing an actress can do in a campy film like this is underact and that's just what Birch ends up doing. Nearly every line she gives seems like it's being read off of a cue card. Her performance is at least enjoyably poor near the end, but for the most part, she doesn't even seem to be trying. The movie's pacing comes to a screeching halt whenever she's on screen. My opinions on the Council of Mages scenes are rather a mixed bag. On one hand, I suppose they do bring more weight to the film's themes on the more homogenous nature of evil, how the laziness and inaction of a nation's people is what leads to its ascent and how good can only prevail if diverse peoples come together to fight for it. On the other hand, these scenes are at a bit of thematic conflict with the more campy tone of the film.Apart from Birch, I love all of the other acting performances in this film. Jeremy Irons has often been the subject of criticism for his hammy and over-the-top performance as the wicked mage Profion, but I couldn't love his overacting more. That's exactly the way that an insane, megalomaniacal, chaotic evil mage like Profion was supposed to act. His overacted performance benefited the film's camp value greatly and his madness felt authentic to me, to the point where the other actors seemed almost afraid Irons had lost it on set.The same can be said of Bruce Payne's Damodar. Payne is an underrated actor and he does great work balancing the more intimidating and creepy aspects of his villain with the more comedic and over the top ones. I enjoyed how the film kept his backstory and motivations more secretive, it gave his character more mystery and made him more interesting.Justin Whalin is a very likable hero playing the role of Ridley. He has some great comedic timing and definitely has an aura of youthful charisma to him, while still showcasing some real emotional vulnerability near the end. I was reasonably surprised how invested I was in his arc from thieving urchin to altruistic hero, he never came off as a simplistic archetype to me and always felt like a real person.Zoe McLellan is great in this film as well playing Marina. Much like Whalin, she has some wonderful comedic timing, but can really step back and step up her dramatic game when the scene calls for it. She has an incredible vocal range in this film and it's a shame we weren't able to see her in more films. Marina is admittedly not as strong a character as Ridley, but she's a likable presence and her arc from high society snob to charitable heroine is investing enough.Marlon Wayans is an...Odd choice to play the comic relief in this kind of film. But you know what? It works. I found him hilarious. His comedic lines aren't nearly as cheap as people make them out to be and Snails isn't nearly the level of caricature that critics have described him as. Much like Snails, he really transcends the preconceptions and expectations you might have for his character in the 2nd half, showing a far more idealistic and self-sacrificing side buried underneath his seemingly shallow ego.Praise should also be given to Lee Arenberg's Dwarven berserker Elwood, who steals nearly every scene he's in with his infectious sense of humor, and Kristen Wilson's Norda, who does very effective work playing the straight woman against all this absurdity.What makes this film work best, however, is the chemistry. Dungeons & Dragons as a tabletop RPG is all about the interaction between players. If that experience falls flat, the session won't be entertaining. Dungeons & Dragons 2000 captures that idea wonderfully. Every actor and actress in this film (Bar Birch) plays wonderfully off of each other's strengths and I had no issue buying their respective relationships in the film and getting invested in them. The film is almost reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy in that respect (With better villains), where the appeal comes from how well these characters bounce off each other.The practical effects and sets in the film have such a wonderful charm. The aesthetic style of the costumes, sets, creature FX makeup, armor and weapons of Izmer is all so unique and inventive. I don't think Dungeons & Dragons 2000 gets nearly enough credit for how practical effects heavy it was, nor for how much effort and hard work was put into those effects. Often times today, a film will give us one character with a makeup prosthetic, some homemade gore FX and call itself ""practical effects heavy"", but Dungeons & Dragons 2000 really commits to that principle.Obviously, Dungeons & Dragons 2000 is no masterpiece. However, it's not the crime against cinema it's made out to be either. And above all, it's fun. I'd say give it another shot.

1.0,What the hell happened here?,"I knew it was going to be bad, but I like cheesy movies. And I knew it wasn't going to do justice to the D&D game, but I was open-minded to the effort. But good lord, this might be the worst movie I've ever seen.Lots of people have shredded this movie in a lot of ways, so I've got little new to contribute to the mass lynching. But three quick summary points: The acting was embarrassing - the Jeremy Irons was clearly chewing up the set with a bad Christopher Lee impression, and Thora Birch really, really wanted to be elsewhere. Whichever Wayans got drunk enough to sign this contract was cringe-worthy, and the best thing he did was die (although he took too long getting about it).The special effects were hilariously bad. The CGI for the sets was a distant second to Wolfenstein 3D, and anything involving 'magic' could've been better accomplished with a handful of colored yarn.Finally, the plot was UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. Our heroes are sent to find the Rod of Thingummy, because the Empress is about to lose her Whatchamacallit. As they mosey along, everyone says 'good lord, don't find the Rod of Thingummy, it's a horrible evil'. In fact, the only person that could be benefited by the Rod of Thingummy is Lord Sinister Big Bad. Still, our idiot heroes keep on trooping around, trying to find the Rod of Thingummy. THEN, the Empress doesn't even LOSE the Whatchamacallit in the first place, so there's NO need for the Powers of Good to get the Rod of Thingummy anyway. BUT THEY KEEP GOING. So, inevitably, they get the Rod of Thingummy (more warnings about 'don't find it' coming in along the way), and HEY, the BAD GUY STEALS IT FROM THEM.Furthermore, that's what turns the tide of the war! The Empress was WINNING until our stupid heroes find the Rod and give it to the bad guys, what's up with that? Champions of the Realm?! They're idiots, and are personally responsible for the destruction of the city.Which is, may I add, a good thing, as whatever Commodore 64 was building the cityscape graphics was clearly overheating at that point anyway.Avoid at all costs.

I had to see it twice, first time I couldn't believe how bad it was. I thought I had missed something but it turns out the makers of this movie missed a lot. They missed the D&D part, this movie only makes a mockery of the game and any plot imaginable. There is no acting, no plot. The very spirit of D&D is completely trashed. One of the worst parts is this Wayans guy who plays a Brooklyn rogue wannabe which is pointlessly killed in the middle of the movie. The characters are hardly believable (how stupid must the two rogues be) not to mention the entire action and party (""Only you were meant to pass"").

Anyone who praises this rubbish as a good film needs their head examined, and I personally thought even the plethora of cgi effects were pretty lame!

5.0,"Campy, amusing heroic fantasy with - you guessed it - dungeons and dragons","RELEASED IN 2000 and directed by Courtney Solomon, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" chronicles events in the kingdom of Izmer where the idealistic Empress (Thora Birch) advocates equality between the mages and commoners while the power-mad Profion (Jeremy Irons) plots to overthrow the Empress with the help of his formidable henchman Damodar (Bruce Payne). A ragtag team is assembled to save Izmer by apprehending the Eye of the Dragon: Two thieves (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans), a beautiful mage apprentice (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and an elf girl (Kristen Wilson).The first shot with Irons hamming it up as the diabolical Profion made me bust out laughing. In other words, the movie telegraphs from the get-go that it's not to be taken seriously. If you can roll with the campiness, this is an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of ""Star Wars"" (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and you'd have a good idea of what ""Dungeons & Dragons"" has to offer. This was a theatrical release that cost a whopping $45 million, but totally bombed at the box office. The 2005 sequel ""Wrath of the Dragon God"" (with only Bruce Payne returning as Damodar) cost just $15 million and is slightly better because the creators took the material seriously, but it's decidedly TV fantasy fare.The film scores pretty well on the female front with the winsome McLellan and cutie Birch. Whalin and Wayans are entertaining as the two main protagonists, if you can get past their goofiness. People love to hate Snails (Wayans), but I found him to be a likable, amusing character.

,Don't get caught in this dungeon,"""Dungeons & Dragons"" is so terrible, I can't help myself from laughing at people who say they liked this film.This is one of the worst mistakes ever made in Hollywood. I had an inkling of what the end result of this film would be; however, I wanted to give it a chance.The first problem is the lack of plot to accompany the numerous action sequences.

I can only assume the writer forgot that there are people who actually like to see a film with BOTH action and story when they see a film. In addition, the cause of fighting the villain is so stupid; who cares.The second problem I see is casting.

With a bit of Return of the Jedi and other star wars stuff thrown in?Whoever did the editing for this movie must've either been asleep or stoned off their face, because the plot was ripped to utter shreds! So many things happen and are not explained or explained poorly. Now a movie of this genre should be easy to understand. So why did this flick blow chunks?WARNING! WINGED SPOILERS! WARNING!1) The boring political confrontation between the Princess (who was a carbon copy of Queen Amidala), and the bad-guy Darth Sidious-look-alike Jeremy Irons (whose acting was dire). Took me half the movie to figure they were fighting over plastic-looking dragon-controlling stage props so they could go to war with some enemy I missed the name of.2) The thief-hero Ridley and mage Marina disappear into a map portraying some place I also missed the name of, and then reappear. Two hours later: still hadn't figured out what they'd done in the map that conjured up all the answers so conveniently. My 'I'm Bored' meter started rising sharply by this point...3) Our hero and heroine kiss. He tells her magic-users are superior and he won't have anything to do with them, then contradicts himself and kisses her. Pardon? Nothing more is tacked on to this boring cliche romance. Did I miss yet something else here? Hmm... Maybe not...Yawn.4) SNAILS?? Excuse me? JAR JAR SNAILS? I thought we'd already endured the awful side kick syndrome, learned from it, and done away with it after the emergence of that floppy-eared, idiotic pigeon-English-speaking fool BUT NO! (or should I say NOOOOOOOOOO!!) Now Jar jar Snails squeals and screams like a girl, but at least he ain't C.G.I!5) Profion's cheesy hench man. You take Darth Maul's make up off, and what do you get? Darth Maul's blue lips! A villain has not been more fake than listening to the drawn-out hissing of his ridiculously funny, cliche lines. My acting is MUCH better... and I CAN'T ACT!6) What the heck were those blue, pulsating eye things wondering around with the guards? Why did this movie's creators include these creatures when they do nothing, not even bothering to appear during a 'climatic' battle scene.

1.0,An abomination.,"Some have said that those who played the game or enjoy genre fantasy films might find something to like in 'Dungeons & Dragons'. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a useless, clueless film from start to finish that has no idea of what it wants to be. It combines elements of a bad script, terrible acting, and average special effects to create a gloriously bad achievement. It's a would-be franchise that shot itself in the foot right out of the box. And if this is any indication of what future installments would have looked like, to that I say, ""Thank God.""Jeremy Irons plays the evil wizard Profion straight out of Overacting 101 - he's all sneers and shouts and waving hands. His lackey Damodar (Bruce Payne) is blue-lipped and black-armored (therefore evil) and exudes all the menace of an overripe eggplant. Thora Birch - wonderful in 'American Beauty' - looks like she was blackmailed into this role, as she's completely catatonic throughout the film, giving her Empress Savina (the wholesome representation of all things Good) zero energy and appeal.How about those heroes? Marlon Wayans (Snails, the thief) is completely annoying, offering nothing to the proceedings; Justin Whalin (Ridley, another thief) - the nominal hero - is a goofball who'd be outclassed by the cast of Baywatch; and Zoe McLellan (Marina, the mage) is the only one who seems to even try to keep to a thematic element of fantasy, though she's in way over her head.  'Dungeons & Dragons' is a complete mess and a complete waste of your time. If you want a fantasy film that draws upon the roleplaying game, try the one that D&D was based on in the first place: 'Lord of the Rings'.

1.0,The worst fantasy movie I have ever seen!,"Sorry guys, I really didn't like this movie. I do think not only is it the worst fantasy movie I have ever seen, honestly Legend and Princess Bride were much better, but one of the worst movies ever made.The dialogue was inane and vomit inducing. In one part of the movie Snails says something along the lines of ""That is the riddlyiest thing I have ever heard"". Not only was that unfunny, but entirely out of place. The direction was off too, and the scenery was okay, but the camera-work was so flat and unfocused, it was barely a redeeming quality. And the plot was poor too, likewise with the special effects and you could drive a big tube train in some of the holes in the action.And the acting was atrocious. Jeremy Irons is a great actor, participating in fantastic films like Lion King and Reversal of Fortune. But as the villain in possibly the worst performance of his career, not helped by the terrible dialogue he was given, he chews the scenery to pieces, honestly the dreadful overacting puts someone like Tim Curry to shame. Marlon Wayans was cringe worthy, his humour was lame and in some cases unnecessary, and Justin Whalin; bland beyond bland. Unbearably wooden at times, and as the hero? Tom Cruise did better in Legend and he was the main flaw of that movie. Just for the record, I do think Legend has its flaws, but it is gorgeous to look at, and Tim Curry's Darkness was phenomenal, and should've got an award. Thora Birch acquits herself better, but her dialogue was poor, and I was thinking, is she a little too young for the part? Overall, terrible.

After using this constantly for 20minutes it was only seen once again.Almost every shot of any kind of action was so close in that you saw legs and arms just go flying past and get so utterly disorientated it was scary.And what the HECK was that bit tacked on the end after the ""looked like the end"" pan out from the tower.

And yes, the main boy / girl characters kiss. (yes I was shocked too)Although the kiss happened halfway through the film we never hear about it again and they never get close to each other again except for a hug (woah!) at the end of the film.And the dwarf. Who is clearly there only to fill the character quotient since his participation in the actual plot is somewhere between zero and non-existent.If you're not a D and D fan you'll be screaming at it. If you are, you'll be screaming at it. If like me you're neutral, you'll be wondering if it really is possible to sleep in cinema seats.I avoided the mummy returns and saw this instead. I have the awful feeling I went for the least intelligent film. At least the mummy returns might have a special effects budget for more than 40% of the film.I feel dirty.",avoid even if you have saw your arm off get away,now where start special effects budget was clearly enough about half film since minutes 1 20 contained lots 80 107 contained lots middle hour had nothing every scene change first 20 minutes was accompanied by long drawn out camera pan over cgi location after using this constantly 20minutes it was only seen once again almost every shot any kind action was so close that you saw legs arms just go flying past get so utterly disorientated it was scary what heck was that bit tacked end after looked like end pan out tower oh dont worry hes not really dead as plot well its kinda there somewhere although they could easily have cut 20 minutes off that middle hour yes main boy girl characters kiss yes i was shocked too although kiss happened halfway through film we never hear about it again they never get close each other again except hug woah at end film dwarf who is clearly there only fill character quotient since his participation actual plot is somewhere between zero non existent if youre not d d fan youll be screaming at it if you are youll be screaming at it if like me youre neutral youll be wondering if it really is possible sleep cinema seats i avoided mummy returns saw this instead i have awful feeling i went least intelligent film at least mummy returns might have special effects budget more than 40 film i feel dirty,0.5450396825396826,-0.007579365079365071,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"
3.0,Meh!,"Hard to say, was this movie aimed toward children? Anyway this is a rather disjointed and also disappointing adventure movie. The ""Dungeons & Dragons"" game serials showed some good potential for a full length movie but somehow they basically messed everything up.It takes too long into the movie before it really starts to take pace and something really interesting occurs. On top of that the story feels messy. It introduces some plot lines in the beginning of the movie, that potentially seemed like good and interesting ones but then suddenly decided to abandon these plot lines for such a long time and starts to concentrate on the extremely formulaic and weak 'adventerous' story-line of the young and totally uninteresting characters. Only after more than halve way through the movie it decides to pick up the first introduced plot-line again, featuring the Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons character. It feels like two totally different and disconnected parts, so when the two of them start to mix it just doesn't work out.The acting is just plain bad. You know, the sort of bad acting that becomes irritating after a while. This is especially the case with Zoe McLellan and Thora Birch. But of course also the weak and silly dialog doesn't help much. Perhaps it also has to do with the fact that director Courtney Solomon was still completely inexperienced at the time. And who's bright idea was it to cast Marlon Wayans? He feels totally out of place as the comical relief of the movie. And what a waste of the Jeremy Irons role. He perhaps has never played a more stereotypical generic evil movie villain but the movie he does it in is one of his worst. Bruce Payne also acts as if he thinks he is the new Darth Vader. Quite laughable.Amazing and surprising to see how much this movie tried to be like the Star Wars movies. Many of the characters show similarities, story elements are the same, some sequences are directly copied and really the list goes on and on but these are the three most obvious elements. It's so obvious that it becomes distracting and makes the movie terribly unoriginal to watch. Why did they do this? Wasn't the concept of ""Dungeons & Dragons"" already original enough on its own? By the way, the Star Wars movies weren't the only movies this movie uses its 'inspiration' from.The movie really isn't bad looking with its sets and such, though some of the costumes were quite silly looking. It obviously wasn't a cheap movie to make. The special effects are just reasonable for its time but unfortunately the movie relies too hard on it and overuses it in parts, of course mostly notable in the final battle.The movie has some extremely bad and silly sound effects. I also really hated the music. It seemed to be alway present and I just wanted it to stop! It was the formulaic type of music you would expect from a genre movie like this, only composed by a composer who will obviously never make it big time.You're better off not watching it.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",meh,hard say was this movie aimed toward children anyway this is rather disjointed also disappointing adventure movie dungeons dragons game serials showed some good potential full length movie but somehow they basically messed everything up it takes too long into movie before it really starts take pace something really interesting occurs top that story feels messy it introduces some plot lines beginning movie that potentially seemed like good interesting ones but then suddenly decided abandon these plot lines such long time starts concentrate extremely formulaic weak adventerous story line young totally uninteresting characters only after more than halve way through movie it decides pick up first introduced plot line again featuring thora birch jeremy irons character it feels like two totally different disconnected parts so when two them start mix it just doesnt work out acting is just plain bad you know sort bad acting that becomes irritating after while this is especially case with zoe mclellan thora birch but course also weak silly dialog doesnt help much perhaps it also has do with fact that director courtney solomon was still completely inexperienced at time whos bright idea was it cast marlon wayans he feels totally out place as comical relief movie what waste jeremy irons role he perhaps has never played more stereotypical generic evil movie villain but movie he does it is one his worst bruce payne also acts as if he thinks he is new darth vader quite laughable amazing surprising see how much this movie tried be like star wars movies many characters show similarities story elements are same some sequences are directly copied really list goes but these are three most obvious elements its so obvious that it becomes distracting makes movie terribly unoriginal watch why did they do this wasnt concept dungeons dragons already original enough its own by way star wars movies werent only movies this movie uses its inspiration movie really isnt bad looking with its sets such though some costumes were quite silly looking it obviously wasnt cheap movie make special effects are just reasonable its time but unfortunately movie relies too hard it overuses it parts course mostly notable final battle movie has some extremely bad silly sound effects i also really hated music it seemed be alway present i just wanted it stop it was formulaic type music you would expect genre movie like this only composed by composer who will obviously never make it big time youre better off not watching it 3 10,0.5579339311482169,0.002629612451041032,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,Very weak fantasy that rips off just about everyone.,"Solomon obviously has neither the necessary visual style nor taste to pull this off properly. Though high-budget, the movie only rarely exhibits flashes of a high visual quality, and it isn't until the big finale that the movie gets pretty; the war between dragons above the city is visually very good. Otherwise, the rest of the movie has a rather boring look. The setting is kind of fantasy-land Middle-Ages, but the story is right out of ""Star Wars""; there is some rather shameless ripping-off from it going on here. (Obviously, ""Lord of the Rings"" is another source.) There is a wise old elf (=Yoda) who talks about the ""force"" - without the actual word being used. Then there is the young, short, robot-like Queen with the face of an angel (Birch) who is nothing more than Queen Amidala. Then we have the hero waving a magic thingy and in the last moment deciding not to turn evil like Irons - i.e. Luke and Vader in the finale of ""Jedi"". Then we had that major sword fight between the hero and Irons's right-hand man, which starkly resembled any sword-scene from the ""Star Wars"" saga. Then there is a canteen scene with a variety of creatures and humanoids, i.e. the ""Star Wars"" Tattooine bar scene. Some other movies also get ripped off, but to a much lesser extent, from what I gather. The film has a sort of humourish approach, but later on tries to turn much more somber in tone, so there is a problem there as well.Then there is the cast; a mixed bag. Let's start with the worst: having the least talented Wayans is downright awful; it's the skinny, ugly one, and he is uniformly unfunny. (Plenty of consistency there, I must give him that: once he decides not to be funny he stays unfunny no matter what.) Fortunately, and rather surprisingly, he gets killed off half-way through the movie, only to be - very, very predictably - resurrected at the very end. (In one movie catalogue the film is accused of being racist because Wayans is just a little side-kick to the white hero. Am I on the wrong planet?!) We shall continue with the second worst: Jeremy Irons. From the very first scene of the movie, we are presented with an Irons who clearly has no idea what he's doing; he is grossly over-playing the evil genius, to the point where it's near-embarrassing to watch him. His grimaces aren't menacing; they are silly, overly manic and amateurish. What he did in the movie wasn't acting but a series of gymnastics exercises for the face. Birch is very cute, but appears little just a little, and is slightly awkward with her imitation of the robotic Queen Amidala. The other white brunette is charismatic, making the most of a ""seen-it-all-before"" script. The male hero is okay (over-acting at times), and so is the bald villain with the ridiculous lipstick.",very weak fantasy that rips off just about everyone,solomon obviously has neither necessary visual style nor taste pull this off properly though high budget movie only rarely exhibits flashes high visual quality it isnt until big finale that movie gets pretty war between dragons above city is visually very good otherwise rest movie has rather boring look setting is kind fantasy land middle ages but story is right out star wars there is some rather shameless ripping off it going here obviously lord rings is another source there is wise old elf yoda who talks about force without actual word being used then there is young short robot like queen with face angel birch who is nothing more than queen amidala then we have hero waving magic thingy last moment deciding not turn evil like irons i e luke vader finale jedi then we had that major sword fight between hero ironss right hand man which starkly resembled any sword scene star wars saga then there is canteen scene with variety creatures humanoids i e star wars tattooine bar scene some other movies also get ripped off but much lesser extent what i gather film has sort humourish approach but later tries turn much more somber tone so there is problem there as well then there is cast mixed bag lets start with worst having least talented wayans is downright awful its skinny ugly one he is uniformly unfunny plenty consistency there i must give him that once he decides not be funny he stays unfunny no matter what fortunately rather surprisingly he gets killed off half way through movie only be very very predictably resurrected at very end one movie catalogue film is accused being racist because wayans is just little side kick white hero am i wrong planet we shall continue with second worst jeremy irons very first scene movie we are presented with irons who clearly has no idea what hes doing he is grossly over playing evil genius point where its near embarrassing watch him his grimaces arent menacing they are silly overly manic amateurish what he did movie wasnt acting but series gymnastics exercises face birch is very cute but appears little just little is slightly awkward with her imitation robotic queen amidala other white brunette is charismatic making most seen it all before script male hero is okay over acting at times so is bald villain with ridiculous lipstick,0.5258836996336996,-0.031466727716727726,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.42}"
2.0,How LORD OF THE RINGS Would Have Looked ....,".... If Peter Jackson had been an untalented AmericanI don`t want to be accused of spouting Anti American rhetoric , there`s too much of that in the world , but the reason LOTR was such a big success was that it was so Anglophile . Every single actor in those epic movies gave a performance worthy of the RSC but with DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS we see a movie that panders to an entirely multi ethnic American teenage audience . How bad are the actors in this ? Well I only caught the last ten minutes ( I was waiting for another movie on the Sky cinema channel ) saw all these multi ethnic kids dressed up as elves and stuff and was totally convinced this was a TV movie about a college frat on a trick or treat prank ! That`s how bad the acting and production values were since the good guys all talk and act with 20th century American mannerisms , but I decided to give it a chance and watched it from start to finish a few days later but was still completely cold on the production values . Some people are convinced the LOTR trilogy is racist because there`s an absence of black characters but I think they`re making mountains out of mole hills . I`m not saying DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS is a bad film BECAUSE of its multi ethnic American bias but it doesn`t appear to be a film made to appeal to anyone EXCEPT a multi ethnic American audience , if you don`t believe look at some of the comments on this site . Even many fans of the role playing game think this film version is a jokePOSSIBLE MILD SPOILEROh and compare the ending of this movie to the heart wrenching departure of Boromir in FELLOWSHIP . It`s like comparing chalk and cheese . Unfortunately the producers of D&D thought they had a bitter sweet ending but it`s just a crap ending , but since the beginning and the middle is also crap at least the producers were consistant",how lord rings would have looked,if peter jackson had been untalented americani don t want be accused spouting anti american rhetoric there s too much that world but reason lotr was such big success was that it was so anglophile every single actor those epic movies gave performance worthy rsc but with dungeons dragons we see movie that panders entirely multi ethnic american teenage audience how bad are actors this well i only caught last ten minutes i was waiting another movie sky cinema channel saw all these multi ethnic kids dressed up as elves stuff was totally convinced this was tv movie about college frat trick or treat prank that s how bad acting production values were since good guys all talk act with 20th century american mannerisms but i decided give it chance watched it start finish few days later but was still completely cold production values some people are convinced lotr trilogy is racist because there s absence black characters but i think they re making mountains out mole hills i m not saying dungeons dragons is bad film because its multi ethnic american bias but it doesn t appear be film made appeal anyone except multi ethnic american audience if you don t believe look at some comments this site even many fans role playing game think this film version is jokepossible mild spoileroh compare ending this movie heart wrenching departure boromir fellowship it s like comparing chalk cheese unfortunately producers d d thought they had bitter sweet ending but it s just crap ending but since beginning middle is also crap at least producers were consistant,0.37280219780219787,-0.0829212454212454,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"
