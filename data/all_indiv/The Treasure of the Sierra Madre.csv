9.0,"Just a great movie all around, but a very dark tale","This film is a sharp-edged study of the effects of greed on otherwise normal men, and one man in particular: Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs. Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are down and out and meet up with prospector Howard (Walter Huston). When Dobbs wins a lottery, he uses the proceeds to finance a trip for the three to central Mexico to search for gold. The three have to deal with the lawlessness of central Mexico at the time - bandits were actually on the loose in that country killing anybody with stuff, and taking that stuff. The Federales were a violent solution to a violent problem - killing the bandits after a summary judgement and the bandits having dug their own graves. So our trio not only have to worry about bandits once they strike gold, they have to worry about the darkness of their own souls. In the beginning, Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs is a decent guy who does not take advantage of others. Dobbs only takes his money from the guy that wouldn't pay and he does share his lottery ticket and is generous with his fellow miners, but as greed begins to take root in him, little by little we see his goodness eaten away. It's a great credit to the writing and Bogart's skills that this is done gradually and played out over time. Incidentally, that's director John Huston ""staking him to a meal"". One of the best director cameos ever (although Polanski in Chinatown is equally great)! Dobbs overestimates himself and the fallibility of human nature. Walter Hustons character freely admits what gold could do to any of them including himself. Dobbs is sure it will never happen to him, but he's never had anything, so he's never faced temptation, and when he falls it's a long way down. This may be Tim Holt's finest performance - it was probably his finest opportunity given he had spent years laboring as a B western star on the RKO lot. Walter Huston as the prospector, minus his dentures and plus a bunch of pounds and with holes in his clothes is not the debonair fellow you are used to seeing in film . If Mary Astor's character in Dodsworth could have thought this was the future appearance of the man she loved, would she have taken her gondola in the other direction? I guess we'll never know.Highly recommended as one of the great character studies in which several characters get studied in detail.",just great movie all around but very dark tale,this film is sharp edged study effects greed otherwise normal men one man particular bogarts fred c dobbs dobbs bob curtin tim holt are down out meet up with prospector howard walter huston when dobbs wins lottery he uses proceeds finance trip three central mexico search gold three have deal with lawlessness central mexico at time bandits were actually loose that country killing anybody with stuff taking that stuff federales were violent solution violent problem killing bandits after summary judgement bandits having dug their own graves so our trio not only have worry about bandits once they strike gold they have worry about darkness their own souls beginning bogarts fred c dobbs is decent guy who does not take advantage others dobbs only takes his money guy that wouldnt pay he does share his lottery ticket is generous with his fellow miners but as greed begins take root him little by little we see his goodness eaten away its great credit writing bogarts skills that this is done gradually played out over time incidentally thats director john huston staking him meal one best director cameos ever although polanski chinatown is equally great dobbs overestimates himself fallibility human nature walter hustons character freely admits what gold could do any them including himself dobbs is sure it will never happen him but hes never had anything so hes never faced temptation when he falls its long way down this may be tim holts finest performance it was probably his finest opportunity given he had spent years laboring as b western star rko lot walter huston as prospector minus his dentures plus bunch pounds with holes his clothes is not debonair fellow you are used seeing film if mary astors character dodsworth could have thought this was future appearance man she loved would she have taken her gondola other direction i guess well never know highly recommended as one great character studies which several characters get studied detail,0.5276638176638178,0.13570275403608736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,God Has a Sense of Humor,"I think the great lesson of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is the effect civilization has on the behavior of man. Some people are only as good as they ought to be and the case in point is the guys that go out into the Sierra Madre gold prospecting and how their behavior changes.Dobbs and Curtin a couple of down on their luck Americans stranded in Tampico, Mexico. They meet up with old Howard at a flop house and his tales inspire them to try gold prospecting. The plot of the film is what happens to them when they find the gold they seek.The Treaure of the Sierra Madre is a film years ahead of its time for the stark realism it portrays. These are not classic movie heroes. I could see this film easily being remade today by some of our contemporary stars like Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Russell Crowe.It also has probably the most brutal bar fight ever put on film. Before going prospecting, Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs and Tim Holt as Curtin go out on a construction job for Barton MacLane who stiffs them when it comes time to pay up. They catch up with him at a Tampico dive and administer a terrible beating to MacLane. This is not some western saloon fight, this is probably one of the most realistic bar brawls ever filmed. I like to compare this film to The Oxbow Incident. In both cases, stress and a crisis bring out the true characters in people. Tim Holt is a lot like Henry Fonda's character and Bogart would have definitely been found in the ranks of the lynchers.Bogart as Dobbs is probably someone who in civilized society is no better than what he can get away with. His descent into uncontrollable paranoia is frightening on the screen, one of his best performances.Tim Holt who most of the time was content to star in B westerns for RKO shows what a capable player he is. In the flophouse scene look for an unbilled appearance by his father Jack Holt.Walter Huston capped a long career on the screen with the Best Supporting Actor Award for this film which also was the Best Picture of 1948. And son John Huston won his only Oscar for Best Director, making Oscar night a banner occasion for the Huston family. Huston's character of Howard you can see playing sidekick in many a Hollywood western. That would be a superficial impression. Howard turns out to be a wise old man.The ending of what happens to the men and their acquired treasure in the Sierra Made mountains is something else. In a location far from civilization and far from law it's shown that the Almighty does have a wicked sense of humor.",god has sense humor,i think great lesson treasure sierra madre is effect civilization has behavior man some people are only as good as they ought be case point is guys that go out into sierra madre gold prospecting how their behavior changes dobbs curtin couple down their luck americans stranded tampico mexico they meet up with old howard at flop house his tales inspire them try gold prospecting plot film is what happens them when they find gold they seek treaure sierra madre is film years ahead its time stark realism it portrays these are not classic movie heroes i could see this film easily being remade today by some our contemporary stars like robert deniro al pacino russell crowe it also has probably most brutal bar fight ever put film before going prospecting humphrey bogart as dobbs tim holt as curtin go out construction job barton maclane who stiffs them when it comes time pay up they catch up with him at tampico dive administer terrible beating maclane this is not some western saloon fight this is probably one most realistic bar brawls ever filmed i like compare this film oxbow incident both cases stress crisis bring out true characters people tim holt is lot like henry fondas character bogart would have definitely been found ranks lynchers bogart as dobbs is probably someone who civilized society is no better than what he can get away with his descent into uncontrollable paranoia is frightening screen one his best performances tim holt who most time was content star b westerns rko shows what capable player he is flophouse scene look unbilled appearance by his father jack holt walter huston capped long career screen with best supporting actor award this film which also was best picture 1948 son john huston won his only oscar best director making oscar night banner occasion huston family hustons character howard you can see playing sidekick many hollywood western that would be superficial impression howard turns out be wise old man ending what happens men their acquired treasure sierra made mountains is something else location far civilization far law its shown that almighty does have wicked sense humor,0.5382539682539683,0.2129365079365079,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.47}"
8.0,One of Warner Brother's triumphs of the forties,"Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, it was now time for Bogart to get down to the serious business of acting For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings Now that Bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of gold Although ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is indisputably one of Bogart's best films, it was co-star Walter Huston who won an Academy Award as did the movie's director and scenarist, John Huston Based on a novel by the mysterious B. Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in Mexico Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with him Tim Holt was also excellent as Bob Curtin, a man who, like Bogart, is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (He could have let Bogart die in a cave-in, but saved him instead.) Young, impressionable, and unprepared, he has never seen the likes of a Fred C. Dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with Dobbs's rage and greed However, it is the director's father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture from both Bogart and Holt as he played Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time Life can't surprise him any more He's already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime Like a faithful dog, he's along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that's just a bonus It is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" one of Warner Brothers' triumphs of the forties",one warner brothers triumphs forties,having had his day as idolized star romantic leading man it was now time bogart get down serious business acting eighteen years it had usually been bogart playing bogart various shadings now that bogart was gone his place was older far less romantic figure one who found new challenges was able meet most them successfully this new phase his continued growth began with story three men search gold although treasure sierra madre is indisputably one bogarts best films it was co star walter huston who won academy award as did movies director scenarist john huston based novel by mysterious b traven film told riveting tale which explored degenerative effects encroaching greed distrust hatred three prospectors who team up search gold mexico bogarts fred c dobbs was amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed camera he is born loser with no potential change sight suspicious unfeeling savage easily corruptible he seems clearly destined tragic fate almost our first meeting with him tim holt was also excellent as bob curtin man who like bogart is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him exercise his baser desires he could have let bogart die cave but saved him instead young impressionable unprepared he has never seen likes fred c dobbs he finds himself overwhelmed uncertain as how he will cope with dobbss rage greed however it is directors father walter huston who literally stole picture both bogart holt as he played howard wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen took it all stride kicking up his heels having marvelous time life cant surprise him any more hes already had successes failures enough one lifetime like faithful dog hes along thrill hunt should there be another pot gold at end this rainbow well thats just bonus it is mainly interaction these three men their first meeting uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made treasure sierra madre one warner brothers triumphs forties,0.5635137085137085,0.1457287157287157,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"All that glitters is ""gone with the wind....""","John Huston's genius as a director is undeniable. From his beginning he showed an uncanny knack for getting not only excellent acting from his actors, but his movies always had a social conscience as well. Mr. Huston loved Mexico and it shows in this film. It must have been a difficult task for him directing his own father in the movie. After all, Walter Huston was a major star on his own right. Both father and son made a great contribution, John behind the camera, Walter in front of it.Basically the story is about men that have drifted into Mexico to escape jail, or in search of riches, as it was the case of the men that fate brings together in a Tampico shelter. Dobbs, Howard and Curtin start out as partners searching for gold in the Sierra Madre. They find it, but as luck will have it, none of them will live to be rich from what they find in that remote place.In the most ironic of film endings, this one will be a classic. After the trio finds gold, greed sets in. Friendship turns sour and the three friends become enemies. When the bandits finally catch up with an exhausted Dobbs, trying to go north, they beat him up and discover some sacks full of sand....Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs is excellent. Of course, Walter Huston made the best out of Howard, the clever old man who has seen a lot in his life. He is the only one that discovers a happiness living the simple life among the friendly Mexicans that welcome him into their community. Finally, Tim Holt, as Curtin is perfectly cast as an honest man who has gone into the adventure without any expectations.The final sequence of Howard and the peasants riding their horses into the 'yellow dust' is amazing, as it it incredible. In retrospect, it seems to be telling us that sometimes dreams of becoming rich the easy way will not be sustained, but honest work will be more rewarding.",all that glitters is gone with wind,john hustons genius as director is undeniable his beginning he showed uncanny knack getting not only excellent acting his actors but his movies always had social conscience as well mr huston loved mexico it shows this film it must have been difficult task him directing his own father movie after all walter huston was major star his own right both father son made great contribution john behind camera walter front it basically story is about men that have drifted into mexico escape jail or search riches as it was case men that fate brings together tampico shelter dobbs howard curtin start out as partners searching gold sierra madre they find it but as luck will have it none them will live be rich what they find that remote place most ironic film endings this one will be classic after trio finds gold greed sets friendship turns sour three friends become enemies when bandits finally catch up with exhausted dobbs trying go north they beat him up discover some sacks full sand humphrey bogart as dobbs is excellent course walter huston made best out howard clever old man who has seen lot his life he is only one that discovers happiness living simple life among friendly mexicans that welcome him into their community finally tim holt as curtin is perfectly cast as honest man who has gone into adventure without any expectations final sequence howard peasants riding their horses into yellow dust is amazing as it it incredible retrospect it seems be telling us that sometimes dreams becoming rich easy way will not be sustained but honest work will be more rewarding,0.6565079365079364,0.31687950937950937,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.49}"
8.0,"""It's a great joke played on us by the lord, fate, nature or whatever""","Film noir takes a Mexican holiday in this gritty adventure from John Huston. Pessimistic and full of irony, yet with a sense of adventure and a moralist edge to it, this is typical Huston material.Huston insisted on shooting on location in Mexico, which riled up studio executives no end, but it paid off in the quality of the picture. Treasure of the Sierra Madre would have really suffered in the canned air of a studio. By using the real thing, he perfectly achieves the stark and dusty atmosphere of the poverty riddled Mexican city in the earliest scenes. The sense of scale and grandeur of the mountains in the main part of the film is also very important in achieving the right effect.Huston's background was in fine art, and it's at this point in his career as a director that it really starts to show. The use of lighting is painterly in a way that is almost impossible to achieve in black and white  particularly in the scene in the peasant village which looks almost biblical. Huston also has this unique style of framing, whereby he uses figures in the foreground and background to give the effect of a close-up and a mid-shot simultaneously. It's a look that is totally at odds with anything else produced in Hollywood at that time.Actor wise, Treasure of the Sierra Madre turns the clock back to the 1930s, putting the director's father Walter Huston in a starring role, and casting Humphrey Bogart as a seedy villain. The cast is rounded off by the too-little-seen Tim Holt. All three of them are spot on. The spry old prospector is a role Huston senior seems to have been waiting to play all his life. Bogart is also great playing the sort of character he made his name with a decade earlier. Also worth a mention is Mexican actor Alfonso Bedoya who gives what is for this era an incredibly naturalistic performance as the bandit leader.Huston's forte was in his cinematography, his shot composition and the rhythm of his films, not so much in his handling of action or actors, which is why his pictures tend to be a bit hit and miss. This one is a hit though, thanks to the strength of its story and the quality of the cast, not to mention Huston's persistence for authenticity. Not my absolute favourite of his work, but certainly one of the best.",its great joke played us by lord fate nature or whatever,film noir takes mexican holiday this gritty adventure john huston pessimistic full irony yet with sense adventure moralist edge it this is typical huston material huston insisted shooting location mexico which riled up studio executives no end but it paid off quality picture treasure sierra madre would have really suffered canned air studio by using real thing he perfectly achieves stark dusty atmosphere poverty riddled mexican city earliest scenes sense scale grandeur mountains main part film is also very important achieving right effect hustons background was fine art its at this point his career as director that it really starts show use lighting is painterly way that is almost impossible achieve black white particularly scene peasant village which looks almost biblical huston also has this unique style framing whereby he uses figures foreground background give effect close up mid shot simultaneously its look that is totally at odds with anything else produced hollywood at that time actor wise treasure sierra madre turns clock back 1930s putting directors father walter huston starring role casting humphrey bogart as seedy villain cast is rounded off by too little seen tim holt all three them are spot spry old prospector is role huston senior seems have been waiting play all his life bogart is also great playing sort character he made his name with decade earlier also worth mention is mexican actor alfonso bedoya who gives what is this era incredibly naturalistic performance as bandit leader hustons forte was his cinematography his shot composition rhythm his films not so much his handling action or actors which is why his pictures tend be bit hit miss this one is hit though thanks strength its story quality cast not mention hustons persistence authenticity not my absolute favourite his work but certainly one best,0.4515037593984962,0.18703947368421056,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Unbeatable.,"I wish I knew who B. Traven was. He wrote the novel this film is based on, and it's a good read. There are stories that he was a German. Maybe he was. The dialogue has little German touches in it. Traven surely lived in modest circumstances in Mexico, the details and dynamics of run-down hotels being far too accurate to have been made up in a comfortable armchair.But it's not really important. Huston and his cast and crew have turned the novel into a movie that is as good as anything likely to show up on the screen. It's an astounding achievement. I can't even begin to list the moments that stamp themselves indelibly into one's memory, but I will mention one, just en passant, so to speak. After killing his partner and friend, Bogart lies down next to a fire and tries to go to sleep. He talks to himself dismissively about ""conscience"" and how it only bothers you if you let it, and the fake, sulfurous fire blazes up higher and higher between the actor and the camera until he seems to be consumed by the flame.Alfonso Bedoya. He made a few other movies but nothing resembling this one. What lines he is given! ""Aww, come on. Throw that old iron over here.""""There's a good business for Jew."" And the unforgettable ""batches,""which doesn't need repeating.It is surely one of Huston's best films. A lesser director could have ruined the novel's plot. But Huston adds his own touches. Cody is killed, shot through the neck, and the old man reads a letter from his wife, retrieved from Cody's pocket. But -- he doesn't know how to read big words!So Curtin takes the letter and reads it. It's not just a directorial flash in the pan, because the scene resonates at the end of the movie when Curtin rides off to meet Cody's wife in the blossom-blooming peach orchard. What I mean is that the letter-reading scene is there for a larger purpose than simply adding to our appreciation of the characters at that particular moment. The fight with Pat in the cantina. Absolutely nothing happens the way it had always happened in previous movies. Huston stages it in a way that an artist would think of. In all movies before this one, fights involved (1) a general melee in which no one wins or loses, or (2) one clip on the jaw and the guy is unconscious. Here, MacCormack, the heavy, done very nicely by Barton Maclaine, abruptly bashes one guy over the head with a bottle of booze and socks the other one. Both victims crumple. But somebody grabs Pat's legs as he walks towards the door. More blows. Bodies slump to the floor and they have a hell of a time getting back up on their feet. More blows. Pat is finally beaten to the floor and he's not unconscious. ""Okay. Enough, fellas. I'm beat. I can't see."" Bogart and Tim Holt take only the money that is owing to them, and Curtin (Holt) comes up with, ""Let's beat it before the law arrives."" Before the law arrives. That's straight out of Traven's novel and is one of the reasons people believe he wasn't that familiar with the English language. Not that it doesn't fit -- but the use of ""arrives"" is just a tad formal.I could go on listing one scene after another that is simply outstanding. I watched this repeatedly with my ten year old kid, Josh, who finally memorized almost every word of the script. I showed it in classes in psychology at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina as an almost flawless depiction of an ego defense mechanism called ""projection."" The Marines loved it. I loved it. My kid loved it. John Simon loved it. Rush Limbaugh loved it. Martha Stewart loved it. Rachel Maddow loved it. Napoleon Bonaparte loved it. Moses loved it. Lenin loved it.

8.0,"""If you want somebody NOT to find it, . . . Put it in front of them""","In the 1920's, labor was hard to find. If you happened to be a laborer, work was almost non existent. Indeed, if you were unemployed and in Mexico, your chances were dismal. Yet, these were the times, which attracted many South of the border. The place was barren, yet many a fortune could spring up directly before you, . . .if you were luckily enough to see it. That is the story behind this incredible film. The legend of El Dorado was only one of the many myths which lured the adventurous to Mexico, another was ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."" The gold of the Mother of Mountains was passed from father to son for generations. Thus when the film adaption was made, it was sure to be sculpted by men of vision. One such man is legendary John Huston who directed this film. Three common men are lured by the promise of discovering a lost treasure. The first is Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a nice enough guy who wants only to be fair, but is hungry to 'strike it rich.' The second is Howard, (Walter Huston) as honest as you expect him to be and a man of considerable experience. The last is Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) who if given a chance, will use it. The trio make a PAC to share and share alike all the treasure they find. However, only Howard is aware of what the possession of Gold can do to a man. To find the treasure, they need the mountain, some hard work, a little luck. To bring it home, will require something only one of them possesses. The film is a Classic and is due to the combined talents of all the stars and the director. If you look closely, you'll see Robert Blake (Barreta) and John Huston in brief roles. ****",if you want somebody not find it put it front them,1920s labor was hard find if you happened be laborer work was almost non existent indeed if you were unemployed mexico your chances were dismal yet these were times which attracted many south border place was barren yet many fortune could spring up directly before you if you were luckily enough see it that is story behind this incredible film legend el dorado was only one many myths which lured adventurous mexico another was treasure sierra madre gold mother mountains was passed father son generations thus when film adaption was made it was sure be sculpted by men vision one such man is legendary john huston who directed this film three common men are lured by promise discovering lost treasure first is fred c dobbs humphrey bogart nice enough guy who wants only be fair but is hungry strike it rich second is howard walter huston as honest as you expect him be man considerable experience last is bob curtin tim holt who if given chance will use it trio make pac share share alike all treasure they find however only howard is aware what possession gold can do man find treasure they need mountain some hard work little luck bring it home will require something only one them possesses film is classic is due combined talents all stars director if you look closely youll see robert blake barreta john huston brief roles,0.5908249158249159,0.18623737373737373,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,A treasure presented to the viewer,"Some movies have certain scenes in them that hold the viewers interest more than others. However every single scene in this film holds the viewers interest. There is never a dull or lagging moment. Three down and outers who at one time in their lives were maybe up and comers strike out in search of a fortune or at least enough to live better than they have been.While Humphrey Bogart gives a superb performance it is Walter Huston who turns in the greatest performance as the old prospector Howard. The scene in the Indian village where he helps to restore a comatose child is one of the most touching in all of film history and is done virtually without any dialog. Mexican character actor Alfonso Bedoya of course steals all the scenes he appears in and delivers his classic ""Stinking Badges"" line.

10.0,A great tale about the darker side of human nature...,"There are already a lot of reviews for this film and it's in the Top 250 list on IMDb, so I don't feel quite as much need to talk about his film in great depth--after all, it's all been pretty much said. This is an exceptional film for many reasons--most notably because it looks into the darker side of human nature--something you don't often see in films during this era.The film begins in Mexico. Two Americans (Tim Holt and Humphrey Bogart) are stranded there and haven't a peso between them. Their needs are few--they just want to get enough to buy a meal and find a place to flop. Through this first portion of the film, both men seem like decent enough sorts and the audience tends to empathize with them--even when they are involved in a vicious brawl with Barton MacLane--you feel the guy has it coming when the two give him a beating.Later, however, their prospects change when they hit on the idea of hooking up with an old coot (Walter Huston) who seems to know a lot about gold mining. The three take off for the Mexican wilderness--and much like the story ""Heart of Darkness"", the good and bad within them is slowly revealed--all brought about by greed.What I particularly liked about this film is what a great professional Humphrey Bogart was.

10.0,Great Character Actors...and No Stinking Badges,"Ever since ""Greed,"" I have loved movies about losers who destroy themselves and others. This is a classic example of the worst of that term as three men try to face off against forces over which they have little control. It's a little like an early ""Deliverance"" where the paranoia and fear and, yes, greed, conspire to take away what could have been quite lucrative. The performances, for me, of Bogart, and particularly Walter Huston, in a smaller role, make this worthwhile. This is the prototype for the Mexican bandito with his grin and his disregard for human life. The confrontation has become the basis for parody. The concluding scene is priceless with Bogart's facial expressions and the utter dismay it produces. So much has been said about this.

10.0,"""The Treasure"" of American Cinema ...","A brutal and uncompromising portrayal of greed's effects on the human spirit and an exhilarating quest of the Mexican El Dorado, the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. You'll be thrilled by John Huston's masterpiece, a genuine monument that would catch by surprise, even the most skeptical viewers when it comes to 'old' movies.The ""Sierra Madre"" was the first major studios films set outside Hollywood, in Mexico, when even the most acclaimed masterpieces didn't raise such a level of authenticity in their exotic setting, like in ""Casablanca"" when Captain Renault refers to the titular town as the middle of the desert. The geography in Huston's film is crucial as it provides the obligatory escapism for any adventure film, with a unique flavor. In ""Sierra Madre"" we get the same authentic feeling that probably inspired Clouzot's ""Wages of Fear"", with the proverbial financial struggle of the white men in South America. There's almost the same criticism of capitalism that prevailed in B. Travel's novel, as these men have been purely and totally exploited by the capitalistic majors that literally raped Mexico from its precious resources.Huston's movie is less politically loaded, but it portrayed capitalism in a negative light through the downfall and total disintegration of its main character, Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs. Bogie, after having been a gangster, a private eye, a cynical, detached, and sometimes romantic lead, probably gives one of his best performances as a big s.o.b. And how he didn't get a nomination is unbelievable. His evolution from a decent man who wants a job and some money to the cold-blooded paranoid lunatic who tries to keep the gold for himself is not only fascinating but also mirrors the evolution of the film from a light-hearted mood, made of some comedic running gags like the encounters with Huston as the rich man in a white suit, to a heart-pounding thriller.And on that very level, the differences between the characters set the perfect circumstances for tension, despite the many signs of camaraderie displayed in the beginning. Curtin, Tim Holt in a remarkable performance, is younger and exudes a certain idealistic naiveté that counterbalances Dobbs' growing cynicism. Howard, the old-time prospector, an unforgettable Walter Huston, knows everything about prospecting, with enough experience to foresee the psychological changes on people when gold is at stakes. Of course, the movie is also remembered for the famous 'Gold Hat', Alfonso Bedoya with his unforgettable ""stinking badges"" line but more than an exotic villain, Bedoya foreshadows with a sort of charming charisma the evolution of Dobbs as a similar bastard.Indeed, one never knows how gold would transform us, and one must have the guts to work alone without falling into madness. During their journey guided by Howard, Dobbs and Curtin discover the true meaning of the word 'value' as measurable through the efforts you spend, days and nights, to find the treasure. Walter Huston deservedly won the Oscar for best supporting character, but he's as central as Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather"". Whatever Howard says, we know it's the truth, when he's reluctant, we understand it's a bad premonition. And when Howard esteems that the best would be to split the share when it becomes money, Dobbs, already showing signs of suspicion, recommends that each one takes care of his own share. Howard is experimented enough to resign, with all the wisdom of a man who doesn't want trouble.Dobbs' gradual descent into paranoid madness is highlighted in the episode when a gila monster gets stuck under the rock that covered his share while he suspects Curtin to have come for another reason. The paranoia grows and contaminates the whole team when another American named Cody, joins them and proposes his help. He's obviously smarter than them and doesn't deny that murdering him is an option they would consider. The way the team handled his proposal says a lot about the conservative instinct that could govern so called 'civilized' hearts, and again, doesn't speak in favor of the monopolistic systems regulated by capitalism. The alienation that grows within the team erodes all the camaraderie built during these months of labor, to a point even the word 'partner' loses its humanistic meaning.Bogart perfectly embodied the metamorphosis of a man alienated by his own greed, where the value of his share of gold, exceeded, every kind of principle that made him a decent man. As it's almost impossible to break free from a gila's bite, Dobbs became that gila with paranoia as a venomous poison, too mistrustful to go, to let go or to be reasoned. When Curtin says he protected Howard's money as he would have done for Dobbs, Dobbs uses the same reasoning in a reverse way, pushing cynicism to its paroxysm : betraying before being betrayed. And in an ironic anticlimactic twist, Dobbs is killed by bandits, 15 minutes before the end of the film as to highlight the pointlessness of this entire struggle. After all, what's the point of earning money if you lose principles? Failure is a recurrent theme in Huston's films with this double dimension of cynical denunciation, generally driven by an impeccable script, and this entertaining dimension that pleases the crowds as much as the more sophisticated audience, both who, matured enough by World War II, accepted a story about greed and deception, but maybe not Bogie so far from his usual character, playing such an unsavory bastard. I don't know, if like some said, this is why the film's flopped. One thing for sure, after 60 years, it remains as one of the most enduring classics ever, that beautifully earned a father and a son three deserved Oscars.And any other consideration is as pointless as crying over the loss of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and the only reaction it deserves is the unique loud and hysterical, jig-driven, maniacal laugh of Walter Huston",treasure american

8.0,Extraordinary and marvelously performed film about a grizzled hustler decides to join with other prospectors to find gold,"Magnificent rendition of B. Traven's story of ambition and human nature at its worst and dealing with an unlikely trio of ambitious prospectors . As Fred Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) , two Americans searching for work in Mexico, convince an old prospector (Walter Huston) to help them mine for gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains . Through a lot of troubles they eventually succeed in finding gold, but greedy outlaws (Alfonso Bedoya) , and most especially craziness lead to disaster . As they sold their souls for the treasure of the Sierra Madre . It's an intelligent semi-western that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts a misfit group , including their enormous difficulties and breathtaking taking on between protagonists and the Mexican enemies that stalk to them . The film blends thrills , emotion , intrigue , high body-count and it's fast moving and exciting ; being filmed in Mexico, though Warners' studio head Jack L. Warner had the unit return to Hollywood when the budget started to exceed $3 million . Thought-provoking screenplay by the same Huston , concerning about greed and ambition that threaten to turn their success into disaster . Director John Huston had read the book by B. Traven in 1936 and had always thought the material would make a great movie . Based on a 19th-century ballad by a German poet , Traven's book reminded Huston of his own adventures in the Mexican cavalry . When Huston became a director at Warner Bros. , the smashing success of his initial effort, The Maltese Falcon (1941), gave him the clout to ask to write and direct the project, for which Warner Bros had previously secured the movie rights . Although by many to be director John Huston's finest film , this is a tale of fear , greed and murder , as three partners fall out over the gold they have clawed out of the inhospitable and bandit-ridden deserts and mountains . It also has probably the most brutal gold bar fight ever put on film along with ""The Ruthless Four"" . Overrated by some reviewers , but very interesting and attractive to watch . It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie, in which the three main roles are the essentials . Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going . They are three totally different characters, which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film . Bogart is superbly believable and gives a nice portrait of an increasingly unhinged prospector , Walter Huston is very good as a cunning veteran and Tim Holt is also pretty well . John Huston has a cameo as an American tourist , this scene was directed by Humphrey Bogart, who took malicious pleasure on his director by making him perform the scene over and over again. And the little boy who sells Bogart the portion of the winning lottery ticket is Robert Blake . The bum seated near Walter Huston in the first scene in the Oso Negro flophouse is Jack Holt, father of Tim Holt . Walter Huston, father of director John Huston, won the Academy Award for best supporting actor , John won for best direction . This was the first father/son win . The musician Max Steiner composes a vibrant soundtrack and well conducted ; including a catching leitmotif and considered to be one of the best . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under sunny exteriors and a glimmer sun and fine sets with striking cinematography by Ted McCord , this was one of the first American films to be made almost entirely on location outside the USA . Also shown in computer-colored version . The picture was shot on location in Tampico, Mexico ; just as John Huston was starting to shoot scenes in, the production was shut down inexplicably by the local government ; it turns out that a local newspaper printed a false story that accused the filmmakers of making a production that was unflattering to Mexico . Fortunately, two of Huston's associates, Diego Rivera and Miguel Covarrubias, went to bat for the director with the President of Mexico , then the libelous accusations were dropped . The motion picture was stunningly realized by John Huston and the film took 5-1/2 months to shoot and was 29 days over schedule ; Robert Rossen submitted at least nine drafts of rewrites on the screenplay when John Huston was away during the war . Rating : Above average . Well worth watching , essential and indispensable seeing . In 2007: The American Film Institute ranked this as the #38 Greatest Movie of All Time.",extraordinary marvelously performed film about grizzled hustler decides join with other prospectors find gold,magnificent rendition b travens story ambition human nature at its worst dealing with unlikely trio ambitious prospectors as fred dobbs humphrey bogart bob curtin tim holt two americans searching work mexico convince old prospector walter huston help them mine gold sierra madre mountains through lot troubles they eventually succeed finding gold but greedy outlaws alfonso bedoya most especially craziness lead disaster as they sold their souls treasure sierra madre its intelligent semi western that scrutinizes greed paranoia that afflicts misfit group including their enormous difficulties breathtaking taking between protagonists mexican enemies that stalk them film blends thrills emotion intrigue high body count its fast moving exciting being filmed mexico though warners studio head jack l warner had unit return hollywood when budget started exceed 3 million thought provoking screenplay by same huston concerning about greed ambition that threaten turn their success into disaster director john huston had read book by b traven 1936 had always thought material would make great movie based 19th century ballad by german poet travens book reminded huston his own adventures mexican cavalry when huston became director at warner bros smashing success his initial effort maltese falcon 1941 gave him clout ask write direct project which warner bros had previously secured movie rights although by many be director john hustons finest film this is tale fear greed murder as three partners fall out over gold they have clawed out inhospitable bandit ridden deserts mountains it also has probably most brutal gold bar fight ever put film along with ruthless four overrated by some reviewers but very interesting attractive watch it above all things mostly also remains real characters movie which three main roles are essentials their dynamic together is also great is what mostly keeps this movie going they are three totally different characters which is foremost reason why they work out so great together film bogart is superbly believable gives nice portrait increasingly unhinged prospector walter huston is very good as cunning veteran tim holt is also pretty well john huston has cameo as american tourist this scene was directed by humphrey bogart who took malicious pleasure his director by making him perform scene over over again little boy who sells bogart portion winning lottery ticket is robert blake bum seated near walter huston first scene oso negro flophouse is jack holt father tim holt walter huston father director john huston won academy award best supporting actor john won best direction this was first father son win musician max steiner composes vibrant soundtrack well conducted including catching leitmotif considered be one best atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors dirty landscapes under sunny exteriors glimmer sun fine sets with striking cinematography by ted mccord this was one first american films be made almost entirely location outside usa also shown computer colored version picture was shot location tampico mexico just as john huston was starting shoot scenes production was shut down inexplicably by local government it turns out that local newspaper printed false story that accused filmmakers making production that was unflattering mexico fortunately two hustons associates diego rivera miguel covarrubias went bat director with president mexico then libelous accusations were dropped motion picture was stunningly realized by john huston film took 5 1 2 months shoot was 29 days over schedule robert rossen submitted at least nine drafts rewrites screenplay when john huston was away during war rating above average well worth watching essential indispensable seeing 2007 american film institute ranked this as greatest movie all time,0.48295219638242887,0.22841408268733854,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.3}"

8.0,Bogart and the Stinking Badges,"Two penniless Americans (Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt) during the 1920s in Mexico join with an old-timer (Walter Huston, the director's father) to prospect for gold. The old-timer accurately predicts trouble, but is willing to go anyway. The film is fictional, but presents a very realistic scenario: By the 1920s the violence of the Mexican Revolution had largely subsided, although scattered gangs of bandits continued to terrorize the countryside. The newly established post-revolution government relied on the effective, but ruthless, Federal Police, commonly known as the Federales, to patrol remote areas and dispose of the bandits. Foreigners, like the three American prospectors, were at very real risk of being killed by the bandits if their paths crossed. The bandits, likewise, were given little more than a ""last cigarette"" by the army units after capture, even having to dig their own graves first.The film shows the Americans doing just about anything for money: drilling oil, digging for gold, begging and more. And once gold comes into the picture, the men who once claimed they were not greedy see things differently. Bogart actually goes mad, after he gets greedy and paranoid... during which he encounters a gila monster! The most memorable scene of this film involves the bandits, who don't need any ""stinking badges"". While the line is much more quotable in ""Blazing Saddles"", we couldn't have ""Blazing Saddles"" (or ""UHF"") without this film... just about everyone, even those who never saw or heard of ""Sierra Madre"", knows the badges line.Humphrey Bogart's best film is probably ""Casablanca"", but this one features him in a nice, rough exterior. Yes, sometimes leading men have beards and are covered in dirt. Pretty boys do not stay pretty boys after digging in the hills, or at least that wouldn't be realistic. This film does a fine job trying to ""keep it real"", so we have to commend Huston not only on his directing, but his wonderful location scouting.",bogart stinking badges,two penniless americans humphrey bogart tim holt during 1920s mexico join with old timer walter huston directors father prospect gold old timer accurately predicts trouble but is willing go anyway film is fictional but presents very realistic scenario by 1920s violence mexican revolution had largely subsided although scattered gangs bandits continued terrorize countryside newly established post revolution government relied effective but ruthless federal police commonly known as federales patrol remote areas dispose bandits foreigners like three american prospectors were at very real risk being killed by bandits if their paths crossed bandits likewise were given little more than last cigarette by army units after capture even having dig their own graves first film shows americans doing just about anything money drilling oil digging gold begging more once gold comes into picture men who once claimed they were not greedy see things differently bogart actually goes mad after he gets greedy paranoid during which he encounters gila monster most memorable scene this film involves bandits who dont need any stinking badges while line is much more quotable blazing saddles we couldnt have blazing saddles or uhf without this film just about everyone even those who never saw or heard sierra madre knows badges line humphrey bogarts best film is probably casablanca but this one features him nice rough exterior yes sometimes leading men have beards are covered dirt pretty boys do not stay pretty boys after digging hills or at least that wouldnt be realistic this film does fine job trying keep it real so we have commend huston not only his directing but his wonderful location scouting,0.506827922077922,0.1624537337662338,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"

9.0,"Still vivid, compact, colorful, and intense, with some acting to, uh, die for.","The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully.And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie.Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade.Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too.Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico.Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clichés, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work.I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece.

Searching for gold has always been a popular film topic n this film has really nailed it with superb display of human nature. Bogart is phenomenal in this film. In this film he is so full of paranoia, insanity n evil but u still feel pity for him. His grungy, unkempt n unshaven look added to the character. The film has a dark tone dealing with human nature of greed, paranoia, evil intentions, insanity n ignorance but it has its share of laughs. Walter Huston's happy dance, Bogart's evil smile, Holt showing equanimity in adversity n Alfonso Bedoyas ignorant n illiterate attitude. The scene, where the character of Holt wondering whether to help his fellow colleague trapped inside the mine n his sympathy towards the widow's share of gold as well his infatuation with the widow by jus looking at the photo r all dealt very well in the film. The scene where the three characters are ready to kill the fourth one is indeed man's darkest nature.A remake is needed with more focus on the action n adventure.",bogart n huston nailed it one my fav movie all time depicting human nature interesting way,i first saw this early 90s revisited it recently blu ray treasure sierra madre is one my favourite n my opinion bogarts best acting display searching gold has always been popular film topic n this film has really nailed it with superb display human nature bogart is phenomenal this film this film he is so full paranoia insanity n evil but u still feel pity him his grungy unkempt n unshaven look added character film has dark tone dealing with human nature greed paranoia evil intentions insanity n ignorance but it has its share laughs walter hustons happy dance bogarts evil smile holt showing equanimity adversity n alfonso bedoyas ignorant n illiterate attitude scene where character holt wondering whether help his fellow colleague trapped inside mine n his sympathy towards widows share gold as well his infatuation with widow by jus looking at photo r all dealt very well film scene where three characters are ready kill fourth one is indeed mans darkest nature remake is needed with more focus action n adventure,0.4160493827160494,0.11666666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Yet another brilliant film from John Huston,"I love John Huston's films, and this is another one of my favourites. For one thing it is very well made, with wonderful cinematography and striking locations, and the story which is like a fable on greed and human despair as well as a fun search for gold in bandit-infested Mexico is very exciting. Max Steiner's score is superb, the screenplay is crisp and the direction from John Huston is rock solid. The acting is simply great, and that's an understatement with Humphrey Bogart giving another memorable performance as the drifter Fred C. Dobbs. And he is superbly supported by Tim Holt who plays a young idealist and especially Walter Huston as the gnarled prospector. Overall, just another brilliant film from a terrific director, with a superb opening and unforgettable ending. 10/10 Bethany Cox",yet another brilliant film john huston,i love john hustons films this is another one my favourites one thing it is very well made with wonderful cinematography striking locations story which is like fable greed human despair as well as fun search gold bandit infested mexico is very exciting max steiners score is superb screenplay is crisp direction john huston is rock solid acting is simply great thats understatement with humphrey bogart giving another memorable performance as drifter fred c dobbs he is superbly supported by tim holt who plays young idealist especially walter huston as gnarled prospector overall just another brilliant film terrific director with superb opening unforgettable ending 10 10 bethany cox,0.6757575757575758,0.4609090909090909,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.21}"
8.0,A Powerful Statement About The Power Of Greed,"With its obvious warning about the consequences of greed, this film is surprisingly relevant today. True, we no longer suffer from the classic problem of ""gold fever."" Not many people go out free-lance prospecting anymore, but corporate greed is certainly much in the news and the economic collapse of late 2008 had at least partly at its root the problem of greed. This wonderful classic uses a more traditional setting, but manages to portray the same collapse of civilized behaviour and the problems that arise with simply looking out for Number 1. In this movie, that position is clearly held by Humphrey Bogart's Fred Dobbs, an American drifter in Mexico who hooks up with fellow drifter Curtin (Tim Holt) and ""old-timer"" Howard (Walter Huston). Together they decide to strike out into the mountains in search of gold, in spite of Howard's warnings about what riches can do to people - and gold they find.The three characters each seem to represent a different aspect of human nature. Howard is past the age of being too concerned with wealth, and seems to treat this more as an adventure, Curtin is the honest one who wants to make sure that everyone gets treated fairly, and Dobbs is the one who catches ""gold fever"" and becomes increasingly greedy and unbalanced as he contemplates the wealth he can now posses. Bogart's portrayal of the man gradually losing his grip was brilliant, and of the movies I've seen him in I'd rank this near ""Casablanca"" as his best performance. Director John Huston made excellent use of the setting and developed the story nicely, with Dobbs and Curtin starting the movie as victims of dishonest greed, before having to deal with the temptation themselves. There's also some pretty good actions with local bandits. In the end, Dobbs' decision to give into greed robs them all of the wealth they thought would be theirs, and their reactions to their loss of everything were perfectly in character, Dobbs being murdered by the bandits, Curtin realizing that he really hasn't lost anything, while Howard, thanks to an encounter with some local Indians, discovers more than he could ever have hoped for if he had simply kept his gold.An altogether wonderful couple of hours. 8/10",powerful statement about power greed,with its obvious warning about consequences greed this film is surprisingly relevant today true we no longer suffer classic problem gold fever not many people go out free lance prospecting anymore but corporate greed is certainly much news economic collapse late 2008 had at least partly at its root problem greed this wonderful classic uses more traditional setting but manages portray same collapse civilized behaviour problems that arise with simply looking out number 1 this movie that position is clearly held by humphrey bogarts fred dobbs american drifter mexico who hooks up with fellow drifter curtin tim holt old timer howard walter huston together they decide strike out into mountains search gold spite howards warnings about what riches can do people gold they find three characters each seem represent different aspect human nature howard is past age being too concerned with wealth seems treat this more as adventure curtin is honest one who wants make sure that everyone gets treated fairly dobbs is one who catches gold fever becomes increasingly greedy unbalanced as he contemplates wealth he can now posses bogarts portrayal man gradually losing his grip was brilliant movies ive seen him id rank this near casablanca as his best performance director john huston made excellent use setting developed story nicely with dobbs curtin starting movie as victims dishonest greed before having deal with temptation themselves theres also some pretty good actions with local bandits end dobbs decision give into greed robs them all wealth they thought would be theirs their reactions their loss everything were perfectly character dobbs being murdered by bandits curtin realizing that he really hasnt lost anything while howard thanks encounter with some local indians discovers more than he could ever have hoped if he had simply kept his gold altogether wonderful couple hours 8 10,0.5080579850988015,0.24761904761904757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,Truly something special,"This film made a huge impression on me when I first saw it at the age of 15 or 16. A recent rewatching on DVD really served to bring home for me what makes this film so special.The whole thing is quite good, but it really hits you when Howard goes off to celebrate with the Indians, leaving Dobbs and Curtin to care for his gold and burros. The ensuing scenes of their spiraling mistrust and tension are absolutely spellbinding--the kind of thing that makes you lean forward in your seat just to get your eyes a little closer to the raw humanity unfolding in front of you. Their paranoia, the way you can SEE scenarios of betrayal dancing in their eyes, Dobbs' burgeoning madness--these are the moments that make this film one for the ages.At its best, film noir (which this most certainly is--Western surroundings or no) makes the viewer complicit in the evil depicted on screen. We find ourselves scheming and plotting in our heads along with the unsavory characters we are watching--we start to feel the same temptations and desires that they do. ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" accomplishes this bond with the audience as well as any film you are likely to see.A magnificent film--one of the few great screen tragedies.",truly something special,this film made huge impression me when i first saw it at age 15 or 16 recent rewatching dvd really served bring home me what makes this film so special whole thing is quite good but it really hits you when howard goes off celebrate with indians leaving dobbs curtin care his gold burros ensuing scenes their spiraling mistrust tension are absolutely spellbinding kind thing that makes you lean forward your seat just get your eyes little closer raw humanity unfolding front you their paranoia way you can see scenarios betrayal dancing their eyes dobbs burgeoning madness these are moments that make this film one ages at its best film noir which this most certainly is western surroundings or no makes viewer complicit evil depicted screen we find ourselves scheming plotting our heads along with unsavory characters we are watching we start feel same temptations desires that they do treasure sierra madre accomplishes this bond with audience as well as any film you are likely see magnificent film one few great screen tragedies,0.525578588078588,0.23390984015984015,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,This is A Real Treasure from the Sierre Madre ****,"Outstanding film with superb direction from the Oscar winner John Huston. His dad, Walter, gave a gem of a performance as the wise, elderly prospector, and he was rewarded accordingly with a best supporting Oscar for this role.The picture should have won for best film but lost to the very dull ""Hamlet."" I guess that Hollywood wanted to show how cultured they were.The picture is phenomenal because it shows the poison of greed in our lives. Humphrey Bogart gave a brilliant performance as the greedy prospector, who literally cracks up during his quest for gold. Cheated himself by an unworthy employee earlier in the film,Bogart was at his best, especially in the scenes where he is talking to himself.Irony is used beautifully here to show that greediness cannot triumph.

10.0,"""Nobody puts one over on Fred C. Dobbs.""","John Huston classic about three men digging for gold and, when they find it, the effect it has on each of them. Amazing performances from all three leads. Walter Huston is just a treat to watch. One of the last great roles in his impressive career. Humphrey Bogart has what I think is his best non-heroic role here as the scummy Fred C. Dobbs. Tim Holt is saddled with a less meaty part than his two co-stars but still manages to deliver a great turn. Huston's script and direction are excellent. Max Steiner's score is terrific. There are so many wonderful scenes in this one. Of course, everybody remembers the ""stinking badges"" scene and the famous climax. It's a brilliant movie that stands among the best of its time.

10.0,An excellent film,"The Treasure Of The Sierra MadreCertainly a consuming piece of cinematic achievement. I was delighted in viewing this film, especially when you have the talents of Bogart, Holt and Huston..oh what abilities or should I say gifts'. My eyes never strayed from the screen, I couldn't take the risk of missing one second of this tremendous adventure/drama film. Bogart played the character Fred C. Dobbs' so convincingly, it doesn't surprise me though he was at his career peak. It was like his portrayal of Lt. Comdr. Philip Francis Queeg' in `The Caine Mutiny' surely no one would disagree he carried the part to it's limit. The B & W format gave an added depth and the direction by John Huston (as usual) was nothing more then what I would expect from an accredited director like him. I was amused to see a very young Robert Blake in the role of the boy selling lottery tickets and the brief appearance of Bruce Bennett as James Cody'. whom starred with Bogie in `Sahara' several years prior. Another reliable support actor was Alfonso Bedoya as Gold Hat' my fondest memory of any of his acting roles must be `The Big Country' in 1958.Walter Huston stood out with his performance, this was the first time I've had the privilege to watch him in a film role. His portrayal was astounding..and the script he had to work with was a treat to hear. Another funny point I want to point out, I don't know why I kept comparing Tim Holt to John Derek. In some of the scenes his appearance and voice were so similar to Derek's it was uncanny. I'm probably the only one who thinks this, but I can't dismiss the similarities (to me anyway).The plot was an interesting one, one that slowly draws you in until you can't stop watching. I really enjoyed `The Treasure Of Sierra Madre' certainly a must see' filmhighly recommended.",excellent film,treasure sierra madrecertainly consuming piece cinematic achievement i was delighted viewing this film especially when you have talents bogart holt huston oh what abilities or should i say gifts my eyes never strayed screen i couldnt take risk missing one second this tremendous adventure drama film bogart played character fred c dobbs so convincingly it doesnt surprise me though he was at his career peak it was like his portrayal lt comdr philip francis queeg caine mutiny surely no one would disagree he carried part its limit b w format gave added depth direction by john huston as usual was nothing more then what i would expect accredited director like him i was amused see very young robert blake role boy selling lottery tickets brief appearance bruce bennett as james cody whom starred with bogie sahara several years prior another reliable support actor was alfonso bedoya as gold hat my fondest memory any his acting roles must be big country 1958 walter huston stood out with his performance this was first time ive had privilege watch him film role his portrayal was astounding script he had work with was treat hear another funny point i want point out i dont know why i kept comparing tim holt john derek some scenes his appearance voice were so similar dereks it was uncanny im probably only one who thinks this but i cant dismiss similarities me anyway plot was interesting one one that slowly draws you until you cant stop watching i really enjoyed treasure sierra madre certainly must see film highly recommended,0.5180364491475602,0.17176366843033508,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) ***,"Okay, I've finally watched THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, and I found it to be one of those tough films to comment on, perhaps due to its very excellent reputation. I found Bogart to be very good in the movie, and I also enjoyed Walter Huston's performance and could see how he earned his award. The earlier scenes of the movie - before the men ventured out on their search for gold - actually impressed me more than the main parts of the film did. The classic moments where Dobbs is asking John Huston for a hand out again and again; bitching at the pesty little kid (Robert Blake!); beating the hell out of his ""boss"" when he tries to pull a fast one. These were my favorite scenes.Once the trio of buddies is out in the heat, prospecting for their gold, I have to say that while the tension and acting was very good, I just guess I had a hard time both accepting and believing that Bogart could actually go THAT nuts, and wind up turning against his friends like that. Paranoia and greed is one thing, but it just didn't sit right with me for this character of Dobbs - especially after we'd seen what a fair guy he is back when he only took his share of the salary instead of grabbing the whole wad of bills from his beaten ""employer"" (then again, I'm sure the turnabout was supposed to be the idea). It just didn't ring true for me that he could do what he did to his pal. I understand that it was the desert heat getting the best of him, and especially the gold working its ugly spell as the ""root of all evil,"" but it just hit me as improbable and excessive that things would or could go to THAT much of an extreme. Dobbs became a man possessed, and the effect was often more farcial than it was intense.I think director John Huston turned in a fine piece of cinematic work, and for technicality and acting (more than content) I did like this film enough to give it *** out of ****. I thought Bogart gave a very good performance, albeit one that I didn't really want to see happen to his character and one which I had a hard time swallowing actually could. I wouldn't be against seeing it again and re-evaluating it further, somewhere down the line.",treasure sierra madre 1948,okay ive finally watched treasure sierra madre i found it be one those tough films comment perhaps due its very excellent reputation i found bogart be very good movie i also enjoyed walter hustons performance could see how he earned his award earlier scenes movie before men ventured out their search gold actually impressed me more than main parts film did classic moments where dobbs is asking john huston hand out again again bitching at pesty little kid robert blake beating hell out his boss when he tries pull fast one these were my favorite scenes once trio buddies is out heat prospecting their gold i have say that while tension acting was very good i just guess i had hard time both accepting believing that bogart could actually go that nuts wind up turning against his friends like that paranoia greed is one thing but it just didnt sit right with me this character dobbs especially after wed seen what fair guy he is back when he only took his share salary instead grabbing whole wad bills his beaten employer then again im sure turnabout was supposed be idea it just didnt ring true me that he could do what he did his pal i understand that it was desert heat getting best him especially gold working its ugly spell as root all evil but it just hit me as improbable excessive that things would or could go that much extreme dobbs became man possessed effect was often more farcial than it was intense i think director john huston turned fine piece cinematic work technicality acting more than content i did like this film enough give it out i thought bogart gave very good performance albeit one that i didnt really want see happen his character one which i had hard time swallowing actually could i wouldnt be against seeing it again re evaluating it further somewhere down line,0.5935140155352921,0.18086035123269165,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.03, 'Fear': 0.41}"
