10.0,Absolutely Perfect. One of the best films ever made. 10/10,"It is a little known fact that India produces more films per year than any other country. The reason that most people don't know that is because their films do not generally appeal to us, and we would see them as oddities suspended in their own culture. Possibly they'd be amusing or interesting to watch, but they would probably be hard to enjoy (to demonstrate the difference in taste, Roger Ebert attended an Indian film festival a year or two ago, and when he questioned its director what American film did the best business over there, he answered that the movie _Baby's Day Out_, which is basically like one of those Popeye cartoons where Sweet-Pea wanders through construction sights blindly, except extended to 90 minutes, had theaters packed in India all throughout its run; the film bombed completely in the US). Tastes differ. Humanity does not. This is proved to the utmost in Ray's masterful _Pather Panchali_. This film has got to be the best ever made about, well, life in general. It reminded me a lot of a Chinese film, Zhang Yimou's _To Live_, which was good, but its situations finally seemed a bit contrived. _Pather Panchali_ feels as real as life itself. To be sure, it contains great moments of sadness, but, for the most part, it concentrates on the beauty of the world around us. One of the major characters is this ancient woman, maybe even in her nineties. She is hunched over, has no teeth, and has crooked eyes. But Ray makes her form beautiful. He often finds characters with exaggerated and odd features. And there is nothing more beautiful in this world than the love between members of a family, and Ray revels in this. The relationship between the brother and sister is heartstoppingly beautiful. I could not say anything bad about this film. But there is one thing I would like to see: a DVD version of this film, and indeed of each of the films of the Apu Trilogy, and only Criterion could do this effectively, which is kind of disappointing, since I know a major film company already owns its rights and would probably never give them up without huge pay; a DVD version with scholarly commentary. Hindu symbology is present in a large quantity in this film, along with several Hindi ceremonies. Of course, I loved seeing this. I am not completely unfamiliar with the culture, so I was able to catch a little, but there is so much I don't know. A commentary track on a DVD would help me understand the film better, and thus love it even more.",absolutely perfect one best films ever made 10 10,it is little known fact that india produces more films per year than any other country reason that most people dont know that is because their films do not generally appeal us we would see them as oddities suspended their own culture possibly theyd be amusing or interesting watch but they would probably be hard enjoy demonstrate difference taste roger ebert attended indian film festival year or two ago when he questioned its director what american film did best business over there he answered that movie babys day out which is basically like one those popeye cartoons where sweet pea wanders through construction sights blindly except extended 90 minutes had theaters packed india all throughout its run film bombed completely us tastes differ humanity does not this is proved utmost rays masterful pather panchali this film has got be best ever made about well life general it reminded me lot chinese film zhang yimous live which was good but its situations finally seemed bit contrived pather panchali feels as real as life itself be sure it contains great moments sadness but most part it concentrates beauty world around us one major characters is this ancient woman maybe even her nineties she is hunched over has no teeth has crooked eyes but ray makes her form beautiful he often finds characters with exaggerated odd features there is nothing more beautiful this world than love between members family ray revels this relationship between brother sister is heartstoppingly beautiful i could not say anything bad about this film but there is one thing i would like see dvd version this film indeed each films apu trilogy only criterion could do this effectively which is kind disappointing since i know major film company already owns its rights would probably never give them up without huge pay dvd version with scholarly commentary hindu symbology is present large quantity this film along with several hindi ceremonies course i loved seeing this i am not completely unfamiliar with culture so i was able catch little but there is so much i dont know commentary track dvd would help me understand film better thus love it even more,0.5840782511835143,0.2805669476722108,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,My favorite movie of all time.,"I've been asked what my favorite film of all time is. It's a silly question, and the answer might have changed over the years. But I am certain now. It is ""Pather Panchali,"" completed by Satyajit Ray in 1955. Strange that I would settle on an Indian film, since I have specialized all my life in Italian movies and think I know a good deal about them. But no, ""Pather Panchali,"" spoken in Bengali and made on a budget that couldn't buy a coffee break on a major production anywhere today, is my favorite film.Why? Oh, goodness...because of its poetry, its humanity, its timeless and haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, its powerful portrayal of a family and a culture. I first saw it when I was a senior in high school. I went to the Avon in Providence, where it played for a week in 1959. Overwhelmed, I went three or four times that week. I told people about it but nobody seemed interested. And it's futile even now to promote this film among folks who only respond to graphic action, moronic one-liner comedies, thundering vacuous soundtracks, the vapid melodrama of snakes on planes. ""Pather Panchali"" means ""Song of the Road,"" and was the first film by its director, made as a total labor of love. He began in 1952 in 16mm, then got financing from the Bengal government to complete the work in 35mm. It took four years, and was shown to great acclaim at Cannes, where it won one of the top awards. It was a radical departure from Indian film convention which has characters breaking out into song every ten minutes, regardless of the story.The movie was the first of a trilogy Ray completed in a few years. ""The Apu Trilogy"" is about the life of an idealistic hero. ""Pather Panchali"" deals with the youth of Apu and his impulsive sister Durga, and the travails of his Brahmin priest father and his worrying mother in the midst of crushing poverty. The second and third parts are ""Aparajito"" and ""The World of Apu."" All these classics are highly acclaimed masterpieces and very much liked by discriminating audiences.""Pather Panchali"" turns everyday childhood occurrences into wondrous events, whether it is brother and sister crossing the fields filled with white feathery rushes to see a train in the distance, a pursuit of the candy man, a Hindu feast, the wonders of the natural world, an ancient aunt telling bedtime stories to children. Death interrupts the family twice, taking away young Durga too. The scene in which the long-absent father returns to learn of the death of his daughter is a lacerating wail from the beyond. Apu's concealing forever the suddenly-learned truth of a secret theft by his sister is a moment, once seen, can never be forgotten. In sadness, mother, father, young son move away. The film ends.Musician-composer Ravi Shankar did the beautiful score. He was a virtual unknown at the time, but I traced down recordings of his music (decades before his legendary Woodstock appearance!) and still listen to them. Ray was influenced by the Italian neo-realists, particularly De Sica in ""The Bicycle Thief,"" which he said bowled him over.In the mid-90s the films of Ray were restored and reissued to great acclaim, and retrospectives took place everywhere. ""Pather Panchali"" and the rest of the ""Apu Trilogy"" are available on video or DVD at libraries and retailers and form the nucleus of any collection of world cinema. It is a shining work of art.",my favorite movie all time,ive been asked what my favorite film all time is its silly question answer might have changed over years but i am certain now it is pather panchali completed by satyajit ray 1955 strange that i would settle indian film since i have specialized all my life italian movies think i know good deal about them but no pather panchali spoken bengali made budget that couldnt buy coffee break major production anywhere today is my favorite film why oh goodness because its poetry its humanity its timeless haunting lyric beauty its imagery its powerful portrayal family culture i first saw it when i was senior high school i went avon providence where it played week 1959 overwhelmed i went three or four times that week i told people about it but nobody seemed interested its futile even now promote this film among folks who only respond graphic action moronic one liner comedies thundering vacuous soundtracks vapid melodrama snakes planes pather panchali means song road was first film by its director made as total labor love he began 1952 16mm then got financing bengal government complete work 35mm it took four years was shown great acclaim at cannes where it won one top awards it was radical departure indian film convention which has characters breaking out into song every ten minutes regardless story movie was first trilogy ray completed few years apu trilogy is about life idealistic hero pather panchali deals with youth apu his impulsive sister durga travails his brahmin priest father his worrying mother midst crushing poverty second third parts are aparajito world apu all these classics are highly acclaimed masterpieces very much liked by discriminating audiences pather panchali turns everyday childhood occurrences into wondrous events whether it is brother sister crossing fields filled with white feathery rushes see train distance pursuit candy man hindu feast wonders natural world ancient aunt telling bedtime stories children death interrupts family twice taking away young durga too scene which long absent father returns learn death his daughter is lacerating wail beyond apus concealing forever suddenly learned truth secret theft by his sister is moment once seen can never be forgotten sadness mother father young son move away film ends musician composer ravi shankar did beautiful score he was virtual unknown at time but i traced down recordings his music decades before his legendary woodstock appearance still listen them ray was influenced by italian neo realists particularly de sica bicycle thief which he said bowled him over mid 90s films ray were restored reissued great acclaim retrospectives took place everywhere pather panchali rest apu trilogy are available video or dvd at libraries retailers form nucleus any collection world cinema it is shining work art,0.4980127606598193,0.17662542794895736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,one of the most profound films ever made,"I won't go into detail about this film, because the greatest films ask that you really just sit back and enjoy them without questioning. This is in a very very small handful of films that create a kind of 'ecstatic truth' that Werner Herzog is always talking about. There is not a moment of hand-fed emotion, and that's probably what hits you first after the film is finished. This is probably why the film has not hit even the first 250 on the IMDb list, while it is more easily accessible than, say, most 'foreign' pictures, it still refuses at every turn to make a cliché out of itself or to be unfair to the audience or its characters by making its machinations obvious, a ploy that most filmgoers fall for time and time again. A reason for this might be that Ray, a young director at the time who had already worked with Jean Renoir on his landmark film about India called 'the River', really didn't have a lot of money or power to wield around, and made this tight, intimate story on a shoestring with an amateur crew, without real concern for anything else but this story that he wanted to tell. A lot of that comes across - the locations, the actors - were all real, however this is a work of masterful collaboration between director, cinematographer, actors, sound recordist, and particularly the editors, a collaboration that is unparalleled in most modern, big budget films. This is a movie created solely with passion, and I am joining in the crusade to make this one of the top 250 on IMDb, though it should, by default, belong on the top 10 of anybody's list.",one most profound films ever made,i wont go into detail about this film because greatest films ask that you really just sit back enjoy them without questioning this is very very small handful films that create kind ecstatic truth that werner herzog is always talking about there is not moment hand fed emotion thats probably what hits you first after film is finished this is probably why film has not hit even first 250 imdb list while it is more easily accessible than say most foreign pictures it still refuses at every turn make clich out itself or be unfair audience or its characters by making its machinations obvious ploy that most filmgoers fall time time again reason this might be that ray young director at time who had already worked with jean renoir his landmark film about india called river really didnt have lot money or power wield around made this tight intimate story shoestring with amateur crew without real concern anything else but this story that he wanted tell lot that comes across locations actors were all real however this is work masterful collaboration between director cinematographer actors sound recordist particularly editors collaboration that is unparalleled most modern big budget films this is movie created solely with passion i am joining crusade make this one top 250 imdb though it should by default belong top 10 anybodys list,0.4611160714285715,0.2483258928571429,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.18}"
,A song for a long road ahead.,"There is this one scene in Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali when the eruption of a conflict between Apu's family and a quarrelsome neighbour brought the film to a complete standstill (for me anyway). Those few characters' state of mind and their relationship dynamics at that point in time, was conveyed with such explosive intensity, I got gut punched drunk. Pather Panchali boasts of suitably melodramatic yet highly intuitive performances. Its breath taking cinematography ranks alongside existential beauty this side of Malick heaven. The musical scoring, by the great Ravi Shankar, is identifiably Indian, yet universally sublime. Together, these myriad parts melded into a whole so grand in its social consciousness, so incisively intimate in its portrait of one family, I could do nothing but be slowly devoured like a most willing prey. On 4th Oct 2003, I saw my all time favourite film, Tokyo Story. The feeling I got today from Pather Panchali, is as close as is possible from that fateful October day. Pather Panchali is one of the best films I have ever seen. This will be a night to remember.

10.0,Possibly the best film ever made about childhood,"*** WARNING: SPOILERS ***The three films Pather Panchali, Aparajito and Apur Sansar form a trilogy, and, although each holds up well in itself, they are best viewed as a unity. Speaking on a purely personal note, I know of no greater achievement in cinema, and have certainly seen nothing that moves me more profoundly.The twin themes of these films are progress and loss. The former implies the latter, and both are, in a sense, inevitable. This is, as all summaries must be, an over-simplification. Certainly, the loss of childhood, of innocence, of parents, is universal to the human condition. Growing up, progressing from childhood to maturity, is similarly inevitable. But Apu wills his progress: at least, he wills its direction. He always grapples with life, painful though it is. Only once, after the death of his wife (in the third film of the trilogy), does he turn his back upon life, but this crisis is temporary: the trilogy ends with Apu once again facing the future willingly, uncertain though it is.It is this refusal to turn one's back, to stagnate, this refusal to renounce, that forms the backbone of this trilogy, and gives it a unity throughout its often disparate episodes. The central character of these films, Apu, always aspires towards becoming something greater, other than what he is. He wants to educate himself. This, in a western context, appears somewhat obvious, but, given Apu's background, education is something to strive towards, to struggle for; and Apu, despite great temptation, never abandons this struggle. It is not that he sees education as a means towards wealth or power: this is not, after all, anything so crude as a rags to riches story. But he does want to outgrow the village, to understand, and come to terms with life and the larger world outside. And in this he is, as is suggested by the title of the second film, aparajito, undefeated.Over the three films, we see Apu progress from childhood to, perhaps, his early thirties. In this progression, we see his character develop through experience. This experience is often painful, and Apu is not always capable of rising above the pain. Perhaps no other film has depicted with such a terrible intensity the emotional pain of loss; but the vision, ultimately, is far from tragic. The last film - Apur Sansar - actually ends with a sense of joy. The joy is by no means unqualified: it has been hard won, and we, the audience, recognize its fragility. But it is, nonetheless, exhilarating.Pather Panchali, the first of the trilogy, takes place some time early in the 20th century, and covers the years of Apu's early childhood. We see him born into a poverty-stricken family in rural Bengal. Later, we see Apu at play with his sister, Durga; we see him excited by the travelling players; we observe the uncomprehending wonder of Apu and Durga as they see a train for the first time. We are shown all those events of childhood that are apparently trivial, but which nonetheless shape the adult personality.Apu's mother Sarbojaya (the superb Karuna Banerjee), is understandably harassed, trying to keep her family clothed and fed. The father, Harihar, is good-natured, other-worldly, and quite unpragmatic. With the family lives an aged aunt, Indir. She is a pathetic figure, helplessly eking out a meagre existence on the charity of those who barely have enough for themselves, and relying on Durga - with whom she has a close relationship - to supplement her inadequate diet with stolen fruit. Aware of her status, Indir generally speaks and acts in an ingratiating and conciliatory manner; but there is a repressed rage within her that bursts out on occasion. It is a magnificent performance from the aged actress Chunibala Devi. Sarbojaya has no patience with this old woman, and takes little trouble to hide the fact that she is unwanted. This is not out of deliberate cruelty, or indifference: it is simply that looking after her own immediate family is burden enough. The old woman, desparately trying to retain the last vestiges of her dignity, is forever storming out, attempting to find a roof to shelter under from some other relative. But she keeps returning: even a hostile roof, after all, is preferrable to none. It is a picture of desperation which moves the heart beyond mere pity. There is one particularly heart-rending scene where she sits in the dark singing of death in her old, cracked voice.This first part of the trilogy ends in tragedy - Durga's death - and I know of nothing in cinema that delivers so powerful an emotional punch. It took me quite unawares at first viewing, and even on repeated viewings, it moves me like nothing else I have seen. Particularly unforgettable is Apu's final, quiet act of love for his dead sister, which really needs to be seen in its proper dramatic context to be appreciated. It is the end of a chapter in the family's life, and they move on. The sense of loss is overwhelming.This is perhaps the best film ever made about childhood.

10.0,The Beginning of a Legend,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS:""Pather Panchali"" is not only the start of a highly recommended trilogy (the so called ""Apu trilogy"") but also the first film of the legendary Indian director Satyajit Ray.It is hard to believe that his entire team as well as himself were busy on their first ever film project.According to Ray himself the first half of the movie is not satisfactory as it is in some ways amateurish.The second half however is very fluent.These are his words and although I concur with his analysis I have to say that the first half is also of a high level.The second part however is truly great and even more so when you remember that it is his first movie ever.That the movie was finished is all thanks to the West Bengal Government who saw some parts of it and wanted to finance the rest,since Ray's money was all spend. As said,the first half is a bit slow and incoherent but that doesn't take away it's overall drama and power.Most of the actors were unexperienced but that doesn't really show.All star performances are from Chunibala Devi as the old ""Auntie"" (she died before release),Uma Das Gupta as ""Durga"" and Subir Bannerjee as the young ""Apu"".These two youngsters played only in this movie,I wonder what ever happened to them. My favorite performance comes from Karuna Bannerjee as she plays Durga's and Apu's mother,a very powerful and convincing role it is.The story is about family life in rural Bengal and although there are several great scenes in the movie my favorite one is the scene in which Durga is sick and her mother tries to cure her in the middle of the night while the storm is raging outside.This scene is so realistic that it actually feels that you are there,the chills came over me.The next morning Durga has died and left her mother helpless while the father (played by Kanu Bannerjee) is returning from his voyage in search of money.Another important part of the movie (besides Ray's great directing) is the music of Ravi Shankar,who is best known for his friendship in the late sixties with ""The Beatles"" (listen to ""Within or Without You"" on the legendary album ""Sgt.

10.0,Incredible,"As an anthropologist who is a film buff, I'm always fascinated by films with solid ethnographic content. Ironically, I must confess that I had never seen Pather Panchali completely. The several times I started to watch the film, seemingly something arose during those few times and I never got very far into it. However, now in my senescent years, I finally got around to seeing it after realizing that I never had taken the time to see it. Having read about the trilogy and about Satyajit Ray, I look back and wonder why of all the classics I've seen, I'd overlooked these works of Ray. Maybe it was the trauma I experienced 50 years ago at UC Berkeley while taking a year of Sanskrit but I doubt it. I'll only say now I must have been saving it for a treat during my later years. And, what a treat! The film has a languid quality and moves slowly, listfully. The imagery is diffused due to in part the quality of the film but the eye of the camera misses nothing from shots of nature to a kitten stumbling and licking itself, to the old Auntie brushing away flies from her food. The starkness of their poverty does not affect the world of a little boy as it does his frustrated mother and sister. His father, a kind-hearted dreamer, seems resigned to his lot and is willing to take less to keep his sense of life and desire in balance. All of this life trajectory is classic Indian and Ray shows us to us through the camera's eye in a way that is moving, joyous and profound. This is their world and Ray lets us see it through their eyes. Akira Kurasawa called Ray a genius and we guess we could say, it took one to know one.",incredible,as anthropologist who is film buff im always fascinated by films with solid ethnographic content ironically i must confess that i had never seen pather panchali completely several times i started watch film seemingly something arose during those few times i never got very far into it however now my senescent years i finally got around seeing it after realizing that i never had taken time see it having read about trilogy about satyajit ray i look back wonder why all classics ive seen id overlooked these works ray maybe it was trauma i experienced 50 years ago at uc berkeley while taking year sanskrit but i doubt it ill only say now i must have been saving it treat during my later years what treat film has languid quality moves slowly listfully imagery is diffused due part quality film but eye camera misses nothing shots nature kitten stumbling licking itself old auntie brushing away flies her food starkness their poverty does not affect world little boy as it does his frustrated mother sister his father kind hearted dreamer seems resigned his lot is willing take less keep his sense life desire balance all this life trajectory is classic indian ray shows us us through cameras eye way that is moving joyous profound this is their world ray lets us see it through their eyes akira kurasawa called ray genius we guess we could say it took one know one,0.5027777777777778,0.04051587301587301,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,One of the best,"The film is certainly a masterpiece. The film is overwhelmingly real and the key element in the movie is the maintenance of this realism. The characters are so true to the ethnic rural-sixties Indian existence that one is compelled to wonder if the film was captured through surveillance cameras. Pather Panchali, released in 1955, is the first film of director Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy. The film is a serene and beautiful depiction of a little boy's childhood in the Indian countryside in the 1950s.The film was made on a shoestring budget by a hitherto unknown director. Apart from a seventy-year-old woman who made her name in the 1930s on the stage, none of the cast had ever acted before and many had been plucked from the Indian rurality. In contrast Satyajit Ray completed the trilogy on the behest of the Indian Prime Minister, pointing to the film's cultural impact.It's a quiet, simple tale, centering on the life of a small family living in a rural village in Bengal. The father, Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee), is a priest and poet who cares more about his writing and spiritual welfare than obtaining wages he is owed. The mother, Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee), worries that her husband's financial laxity will leave her without enough food for her two children, daughter Durga (Uma Das Gupta) and son Apu (Subir Bannerjee). Harihar's family often lives on the edge of poverty, coping with the unkind taunts of their neighbors, the burden of caring for an aging aunt (Chunibala Devi), and the terrible aftermath of a natural catastrophe.Most of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either Sarbojaya or Durga, and, as a result, we identify most closely with these two. Harihar is absent for more than half of the movie, and, before the penultimate scene, Apu is a mere witness to events, rather than a participant. Until the closing moments, we don't get a sense of the young boy as a fully formed individual, since he's always in someone else's shadow. The simple story of the Bengali family will definitely stay in my heart for a long time to come.

10.0,A Magnificent Movie!,"I don't know how even 6.4% of the female voters could have given this movie a 2!!!!! This was Ray's first movie, but his economy of dialog, his synchronization and sympathy with India's rural life is incredible. So little said, yet so much! Apu and Durga following the sweetmeat seller, the scene where they run through a ""kash"" field....superb, the work of a real artist, a master. The film develops its characters and the atmosphere slowly and resolutely. The narrative builds up to a powerful climax. Ray had an ancient camera while shooting this movie, did it matter? No. His expression and technique was more than sound, although this was a maiden venture. Some critics found(and still find, I might add) the film to be too slow. Satyajit Ray wrote about the slow pace - ""The cinematic material dictated a style to me, a very slow rhythm determined by nature, the landscape, the country. The script had to retain some of the rambling quality of the novel because that in itself contained a clue to the authenticity: life in a poor Bengali village does ramble.""There you are, if you have not watched this movie, you'll probably missed the greatest movie made on Indian rural life. That's why Akira Kurosawa said of him:""To have not seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun""",magnificent movie,i dont know how even 6 4 female voters could have given this movie 2 this was rays first movie but his economy dialog his synchronization sympathy with indias rural life is incredible so little said yet so much apu durga following sweetmeat seller scene where they run through kash field superb work real artist master film develops its characters atmosphere slowly resolutely narrative builds up powerful climax ray had ancient camera while shooting this movie did it matter no his expression technique was more than sound although this was maiden venture some critics found still find i might add film be too slow satyajit ray wrote about slow pace cinematic material dictated style me very slow rhythm determined by nature landscape country script had retain some rambling quality novel because that itself contained clue authenticity life poor bengali village does ramble there you are if you have not watched this movie youll probably missed greatest movie made indian rural life thats why akira kurosawa said him have not seen films ray is have lived world without ever having seen moon sun,0.47238095238095246,0.18440476190476193,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.46}"
,masterpiece,"What a wonderful film. For those who have not watched any films from India or heard of Ray, I strongly recommend it. Full of sadness, hope, innocence, and despair, it is an emotionally evocative portrait of the life of an Indian family, their trials, and their courage and persistence throughout. They go on, not because they are exceptional, but because they must, because they are human.Ray does a masterful job of capturing the simple joys of childhood, and the ambitions and dreams which make us all human, regardless of where we are. Simple scenes such as a disfigured elderly woman seated on a porch, singing of her approaching death, are very moving. I have never seen the basic elements of life treated with such an incisive yet soft touch as Ray has in this film. It is wonderful to watch in comparison to the broad writing strokes and vulgar generalities of most directing and writing today.

8.0,This movie is a milestone in Indian cinema,"Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies.

10.0,simply wonderful,"...it is one of those greatest works of art..so lyrical yet so composed. there is one phrase that Ray has used extensively in his writings; something that his professor use to say when he was studying painting in Shantiniketan: ""look at Fujiyama, Fire within and Calm without.

10.0,At last I happen to see this masterpiece,"Growing up in India I had heard of this movie as one of Satyajit Ray's classics and a movie which showed the utter poverty of rural India. Anything classic used to evoke a feeling of a movie usually boring and worse it's most likely would be a black and white film lamenting on the sorry state of human affairs. Of course those were the childhood metrics to gauge what a good film should be and thankfully I have outgrown those notions. Nevertheless I wanted to watch this movie when Satyajit Ray died in 1992 and once again media was talking about his movies. But somehow I didn't have access to this movie anywhere (those days of VHS tapes).I watched this movie recently and was in a stunned mode throughout the span of movie. What an emotional roller coaster ride this had been and it has been done without even making you feel that it's a movie, it's just seems real life happening in front of your eyes. I don't want to describe much the story here(as other have already commented much) but more of what I felt watching (re-watching)this movie. The beautiful and poetic flow of this movie is so smooth that you sort of start living the life as depicted. This movie conveys the reality of hard life but with such gracefulness that you don't feel utterly bad or depressed rather you start contemplating about your existence and the beauty in such mundane things that we tend to ignore. This film gives you the moment, the pause, that forces you to reflect on the meaning of life. There were many moments in the film which touched the heart in many ways: - Durga and Apu's longing for sweets and following the ""misty kaka"" (candy man) in hope. - Old Aunt's happiness on such small things as getting a stolen fruit, couple of stolen chillies, etc. - Mom's inner strength on managing on in a hopeless situation and shattering of it with Durga's death. - Father's wail on hearing the fate of Durga... - Apu's instinctive hiding of the truth about Durga's theft.I am fascinated and surely will watch the other two movies in the trilogy...",at last i happen see this masterpiece,growing up india i had heard this movie as one satyajit rays classics movie which showed utter poverty rural india anything classic used evoke feeling movie usually boring worse its most likely would be black white film lamenting sorry state human affairs course those were childhood metrics gauge what good film should be thankfully i have outgrown those notions nevertheless i wanted watch this movie when satyajit ray died 1992 once again media was talking about his movies but somehow i didnt have access this movie anywhere those days vhs tapes i watched this movie recently was stunned mode throughout span movie what emotional roller coaster ride this had been it has been done without even making you feel that its movie its just seems real life happening front your eyes i dont want describe much story here as other have already commented much but more what i felt watching re watching this movie beautiful poetic flow this movie is so smooth that you sort start living life as depicted this movie conveys reality hard life but with such gracefulness that you dont feel utterly bad or depressed rather you start contemplating about your existence beauty such mundane things that we tend ignore this film gives you moment pause that forces you reflect meaning life there were many moments film which touched heart many ways durga apus longing sweets following misty kaka candy man hope old aunts happiness such small things as getting stolen fruit couple stolen chillies etc moms inner strength managing hopeless situation shattering it with durgas death fathers wail hearing fate durga apus instinctive hiding truth about durgas theft i am fascinated surely will watch other two movies trilogy,0.45782163742690046,0.07017543859649124,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.33}"

4.0,I really wanted to like this one more than I did.,"I am a big fan of many Italian Neo-realist films, particularly films by De Sica, such as ""The Children Are Watching Us"" and ""Umberto D."" and I have really enjoyed several of Indian director Satyajit Ray, such as ""The Big City""...so I assumed I would enjoy ""Pather Panchali"". After all, Parallel Cinema (also called 'New Indian Cinema') is India's answer to this style of film which uses real folks (non actors) in realistic situations. But, as I watched, I was shocked that I did not like this film. I felt oddly disconnected from it and at odds with the film experts who see ""Pather Panchali"" as a classic. Heck, it's currently the highest rated Indian film on IMDB....yet I just didn't like it. I felt the film was very, very slow and I had a hard time focusing on the story...mostly because there really wasn't much of one. These people are very poor, generally miserable and it just felt oppressive.Just because I didn't like this film doesn't mean I won't try the other two films in Ray's 'Apu Trilogy'...but I felt disappointed by this one and I really wanted to like the movie...but didn't.By the way, I've probably reviewed at least a couple hundred Indian films....so it's not like I don't enjoy their pictures nor Ray's work. It was just this particular one...and much of it might be because there's been so much hype about this being a great film, my expectations couldn't help but be too high.",i really wanted like this one more than i did,i am big fan many italian neo realist films particularly films by de sica such as children are watching us umberto d i have really enjoyed several indian director satyajit ray such as big city so i assumed i would enjoy pather panchali after all parallel cinema also called new indian cinema is indias answer this style film which uses real folks non actors realistic situations but as i watched i was shocked that i did not like this film i felt oddly disconnected it at odds with film experts who see pather panchali as classic heck its currently highest rated indian film imdb yet i just didnt like it i felt film was very very slow i had hard time focusing story mostly because there really wasnt much one these people are very poor generally miserable it just felt oppressive just because i didnt like this film doesnt mean i wont try other two films rays apu trilogy but i felt disappointed by this one i really wanted like movie but didnt by way ive probably reviewed at least couple hundred indian films so its not like i dont enjoy their pictures nor rays work it was just this particular one much it might be because theres been so much hype about this being great film my expectations couldnt help but be too high,0.40303628389154694,0.037031499202551825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.21}"
10.0,The Greatest Film Ever Made.,"True art transcends its medium. Like being connected to a higher spirit of life. God bless you Satyajit Ray. The reason I became a film maker. The essential element here is, I think, humility. Humility in the eyes of one's fellow man, in the eyes of a higher common spirit. Puts to shame the common ego on display by most directors. Ray puts his characters, their story, their humanity before all else. This is what the great art of film making is for, and what it can teach us all. A film of a pure and great love.",greatest film ever made,true art transcends its medium like being connected higher spirit life god bless you satyajit ray reason i became film maker essential element here is i think humility humility eyes ones fellow man eyes higher common spirit puts shame common ego display by most directors ray puts his characters their story their humanity before all else this is what great art film making is what it can teach us all film pure great love,0.5874999999999999,0.33869047619047615,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,Brilliance of a brilliant story teller...,"10/10... arguably the best ever Indian movie. I don't like to repeat on the statements which my fellow reviewers have already expressed. What more you can say of this movie..a masterpiece, oh no!! I think you have to term a word which is more superlative than ""superlative"". It's a pity the year ""Pather Panchali"" was released there was no Oscar category for foreign language films, otherwise, India would have won one, of course, if the Indian government had chose to send this above the bollywood movies.I liked one of the comments of the reviewers, if Hollywood is 'dumb' then bollywood is 'dumber'. Really speaking, I doubt if anyone in India can ever cross the brilliance of this film, hailed as a masterpiece! At least tell me any B'wood films which even comes half close, not even the over rated ""Lagaan""!! This movie and of course, other Ray's movies are intelligent, real and visualistic art. So what are the b'wood ones: tissue papers....and the worst part of it is years after years these ""dumber"" movies have been sent for Oscar nominations incessantly! Time to grow up b'wood, isn't it?? And what the foreigners see?? The scraps of the traditional bollywood ""dumber"" movies; what they miss: the excellence of the regional Indian movies!!

9.0,A film of Quiet Perspective and Natural Beauty.,"""Pather Panchali"", Satyajit Ray's debut film about life in a Bengali village, was the first movie from India to gain wide recognition and acclaim in the west. It is an affecting story of a rural family struggling to deal with poverty and tragedy in their ancestral home. Ray adapted the script from Bibhuti Bihushaw Banerjee's semi-autobiographical novel of the same title and retells it with natural beauty and a quiet perspective. The filmmaker, who came from a literary and artistic background(He was a product of the Indian Renaissance) was interested in the contemporary problems of his country-and he shared with the Neorealist films from Italy- a simple and direct approach to making movies. Ray created ordinary scenes that were incredibly life-like. His films contained very few strains of artifice. He believed that the raw material of cinema was life itself. Ray generally concentrated on small subjects and ordinary people. He favored using non-actors and shooting on location to heighten the realism. He made films in his own style; dignified and subtle; sincere and with a conscience. In ""Pather Panchali"" (Song of the Little Road"") Ray makes superb use of his milieu. The viewer immediately feels the cramped conditions of the families' decaying house and the open-air confines of the surrounding forest. When Ray sends his camera beyond the village, the observer can sense the allure and freedom of the vast fields that spring immodestly from a thin, winding trail. Rays' was a cinema of thought and feeling, in which emotion was deliberately restrained because it is so strong. This restraint adds to the psychological intensity in his work. Nearly all of his films are marked by this remarkable depth of feeling. ""Pather Panchali"", the first installment of the Apu Trilogy(""Aparajito"" and ""The World of Apu"" would follow) depicts a young boy (Apu) exploring his ever-expanding universe with a growing sense of wonder. Ray excelled at showing how children and adolescents confront mystery and joy; sadness and death. The director shows Apu's burgeoning awareness with a masterful use of the long shot. High-angled, distant shots track Apu and his older sister Durga, as they run spiritedly through white-kashed fields. This sense of discovery gives the film it's emotional power. The director's main subject was India-it's customs and culture. It's conflicts between the traditional way of life and the impact and influence of the West. He tried arduously to capture this synthesis between western ideas and traditional Hindu values. His concern for human problems and not issues of national politics gave his films universal appeal. ""Pather Panchali"" delineates the small joys and acute sorrows of a poor Indian family. It is an endearing testament that poverty does not nullify love and that even the most afflicted person can find some modest pleasures in their world. The film's indigenous sound track is vital to Ray's story of ancestral limitations. Twanging ektaras, wailing tarshehnais and six-stringed sitars resound liberally throughout the movie. It would be difficult to imagine ""Pather Panchali"" without it's memorable score. Satyajit Ray was an unpretentious filmmaker. He was genuinely uninterested in commercial considerations. His films were life-affirming, authentic and honest; gentle and poetic- truthful observations on human behavior that employed simple but strong themes. Ray's unadorned style of film-making was intimate, probing, and revealing. (Possible spoiler) The final scene shows the grieving family leaving their home in an ox-driven carriage to begin a new life. A trailing camera in medium close-up captures a compelling mixture of emotions on their faces. Expressions of pain and resolution; hope and despair; the future and the past. A seemingly simple yet unmistakably powerful scene that typifies Satyajit Ray's profound cinema. A cinema of gentle but deep observation, understanding and unabashed love of the human race.",film quiet perspective natural beauty,pather panchali satyajit rays debut film about life bengali village was first movie india gain wide recognition acclaim west it is affecting story rural family struggling deal with poverty tragedy their ancestral home ray adapted script bibhuti bihushaw banerjees semi autobiographical novel same title retells it with natural beauty quiet perspective filmmaker who came literary artistic background he was product indian renaissance was interested contemporary problems his country he shared with neorealist films italy simple direct approach making movies ray created ordinary scenes that were incredibly life like his films contained very few strains artifice he believed that raw material cinema was life itself ray generally concentrated small subjects ordinary people he favored using non actors shooting location heighten realism he made films his own style dignified subtle sincere with conscience pather panchali song little road ray makes superb use his milieu viewer immediately feels cramped conditions families decaying house open air confines surrounding forest when ray sends his camera beyond village observer can sense allure freedom vast fields that spring immodestly thin winding trail rays was cinema thought feeling which emotion was deliberately restrained because it is so strong this restraint adds psychological intensity his work nearly all his films are marked by this remarkable depth feeling pather panchali first installment apu trilogy aparajito world apu would follow depicts young boy apu exploring his ever expanding universe with growing sense wonder ray excelled at showing how children adolescents confront mystery joy sadness death director shows apus burgeoning awareness with masterful use long shot high angled distant shots track apu his older sister durga as they run spiritedly through white kashed fields this sense discovery gives film its emotional power directors main subject was india its customs culture its conflicts between traditional way life impact influence west he tried arduously capture this synthesis between western ideas traditional hindu values his concern human problems not issues national politics gave his films universal appeal pather panchali delineates small joys acute sorrows poor indian family it is endearing testament that poverty does not nullify love that even most afflicted person can find some modest pleasures their world films indigenous sound track is vital rays story ancestral limitations twanging ektaras wailing tarshehnais six stringed sitars resound liberally throughout movie it would be difficult imagine pather panchali without its memorable score satyajit ray was unpretentious filmmaker he was genuinely uninterested commercial considerations his films were life affirming authentic honest gentle poetic truthful observations human behavior that employed simple but strong themes rays unadorned style film making was intimate probing revealing possible spoiler final scene shows grieving family leaving their home ox driven carriage begin new life trailing camera medium close up captures compelling mixture emotions their faces expressions pain resolution hope despair future past seemingly simple yet unmistakably powerful scene that typifies satyajit rays profound cinema cinema gentle but deep observation understanding unabashed love human race,0.5197131017131015,0.14862697487697488,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.4}"
