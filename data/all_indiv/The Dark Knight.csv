10.0,The Batman of our dreams! So much more than a comic book movie,"I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy Villain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's ""White Knight"" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10",batman our dreams so much more than comic book movie,i got see dark knight wednesday night reason though why im writing this movie comment this late is because i didnt wanna just jump say this movie was awesome i wanted think it through still today i cant stop thinking about this movie dark knight lives up its hype goes beyond it this is batman movie that goes where no other batman movie has gone before it gave us real sold story we are finally told why villains are way they are how all injustice world can get underneath batmans skin how you have believe that people still have faith good earth heath ledger i absolutely loved jack nicolsons performance 1989 film when i first read that heath was signed onto dark knight i was like what are they kidding once you see dark knight heath was incredible im not going compare jack heaths performance because they were two different versions joker but heaths joker was definitely more scary intense two nominations you didnt know what he was going do next he was so crazy he was also so charismatic point where you could relate his character worst part is not only that hes crazy hes driving gotham crazy treating everyone like little puppets strings that he can control guess what he is doing it so well with smile his face this was so much more than batman film this was so much more than comic book film dark knight truly delivers with drama action romance horror dark humor study psychopathic killer detective story force behind this epic movie is christopher nolan whos previous film batman begins didnt really thrill me but his incredible film making is truly shown dark knight shots that he got gotham city were absolutely fantastic made you feel part city part batman story one things that i absolutely loved about dark knight is that normally with comic book movie you know its not real people dont dress up costumes save day villains dont name themselves crazy names dress make up or crazy costumes but dark knight actually makes it seem incredibly real like it could happen bruce wayne is still learning how be his double life batman himself he has lost rachel new district attorney harvey dent hes inspiring others who are dressing up as batman are trying take villains city themselves but things are much worse when joker waltzes into town hes going bring hell upon gotham city constantly playing with gothams mind trying get batman reveal himself batman has never dealt with such psychopathic genius before joker has named himself as classy villain that gotham needs he also has brought new thought into batmans head them actually being more alike than different that batman completes him joker would be nothing without him but batman is relying harvey dent who is gothams white knight trying put all gothams scum jail but when joker plays batman commissioner gordon harvey rachel find themselves very horrific position harvey must discover if he will die hero or live long enough become villain all performances are dead this movie now everyones going crazy over heath ledgers performance but one performance i would also love credit is aaron eckhart who plays harvey dent two face his performance was just as great as heaths made two face human villain you could understand his hatred vengeance what happened him why he became two face i know that everyone is saying this but i truly mean when i say this is one best movies i have seen very long time we had some great movies these past few years but i think dark knight is seriously something special but i dont wanna build it up too much since some people go theater expecting my words be same as your own my opinion though this is not great movie i cant come up with word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was be honest i would go above 10 rating if i could this is batman film that we have been waiting ive seen it twice one weekend im going see it three times this upcoming week i dont mind one bit i cant wait sequel i would just like say rip heath wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as joker 10 10,0.5393113275613274,0.062374819624819604,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9.0,A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions,"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions.

10.0,Best superhero movie of all time,"I think that I could wax lyrical but this movie all day. It is absolutely incredible from start to finish.This is the Batman trilogy's second outing. It's filled with hard-hitting action and almost every scene is absolutely enthralling to watch. The story is really good. The twists and turns keep the viewer constantly on their toes, especially in the third act of the movie. There are so many memorable scenes packed throughout this movie, so many quotes and ideas sprinkled throughout that you probably could analyze it for hours.Because while the action and story is incredible, it is the dynamic between the Batman and the Joker that really makes this movie what it is. It is all in the contrast between the two. Right against wrong. Chaos and anarchy versus order. The Joker is the perfect villain for Batman. Batman is literally, as said in the movie, a symbol. The very essence of the idea of the Batman is centered around order, rules and moral codes. He is the embodyment of what is right. The Joker challenges the very core and foundation of who Batman is and what he stands for. He is someone who doesn't follow any rules. He is pure chaos and anarchy personified. As he so perfectly states in the third act of the movie, while hanging upside down off of a building: ""this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object"". The Joker wants the Batman to go against his morals and to break his rules. The powerful thing is also that you can see why the Joker does what he does. In some ways he has a point and that also adds another layer to the character and to the dynamic between the two. It is truly an amazing battle. The brilliant acting from Heath Ledger is a major part of it too. He is absolutely incredible as the Joker. Rest in peace.I could probably go on further about how great I think this movie is but I'll just say this. Just watch the movie. You should watch the first movie of the trilogy first but if that is something you absolutely don't wan't to do I still think you should see this movie.

10.0,"Surpasses ""Begins"" in every aspect!!!","Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace.

10.0,The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made,"I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film ""Batman Begins,"" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with ""Batman Begins."" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (""Thankyou for Smoking"") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!",dark knight is as good as everyone says easily best superhero film made,i think big question or question everyone actually cares about is this is christopher nolans follow up critically acclaimed 2005 film batman begins dark knight as good as everyone is saying quite simply yes yes it is there is no doubt about it one most anticipated movies 21st century duly deserves every amount praise lavished onto it this is no ordinary superhero movie this is character dialogue driven piece not as action orientated as you might expect i will not go into plot details because there is lot it however basic one sentence summary is batman now has face his most cunning psychotic enemy someone with no real motives joker now that that is out way i will start off with actors boy is there lot talk about christian bale has done tremendous job as our beloved caped crusader with him already blowing everyone else out water with batman begins bruce wayne has flawed personality that hangs balance between righteousness criminal his perception justice causes emotional personal shift whether he is wealthy businessman who fights crime gadget riddled suit or just normal man who is sick all scum gotham city decides give law breakers dose their own medicine because this bales tremendous acting bruce wayne is justified we emphasise with bales flawed hero more than any other actors if there ever was excellent batman this is it theme right wrong is played well with his character here course i am sure you all want know if heath ledger was that good i can safely say that he most definitely was ledgers joker is not only best but is now greatest superhero film villain ever his performance is truly terrifying chilling brilliant any synonyms previous adjectives every scene he is is stolen joker truly is batmans worst villain cunning psychotic nothing quite matches his laugh sinister makeup if ledger nabs oscar best actor i honestly will not be surprised it is true tragedy see such talented actor fall at such young age all other actors cannot be forgotten though aaron eckhart has definitely proved himself previously thankyou smoking as someone watch out here as harvey dent later two face he is very powerful all he wants is justice bring down every single criminal eckhart is definitive two face maggie gyllenhaal as wayne dents love interest rachel dawes is much better than katie holmes gyllenhaals performance has substance i really cared her her future she was terrific every scene michael caine can do no wrong as alfred pennyworth he provides some comical emotional scenes morgan freeman as lucius fox although limited role does inject some sly humour much needed morals into story finally gary oldmans lt james gordon is riveting he at least needs best supporting actor nomination his performance as another crime fighting hero who faces some challenging situations wally pfisters cinematography is simply stunning gotham has never looked so good so big deep his wide shots purvey dirty aura contribute feel film without it it may not have been same another oscar worthy portion music with hans zimmer james newton howard at helm how could it go wrong score sets mood every scene giving epic thrilling tone during action sequences it really ups adrenaline topic action dark knight succeeds having best fight sequences car chases comic book adaptation yet with no obvious or over use cgi explosions accidents are real deal thrilling edge your seat violent this is brutally awesome stuff nevertheless none this would be possible without christopher nolan man behind it all pairing up with writer brother jonathon nolan darkest batman movie yet is best best so far this year this does not feel like comic book film dialogue situations feel so realistic it is script that drives this film dialogue is very very well written is centre conflict movie it may be bold say this but this is best superhero film all time there are others that are magnificent superman x men are two examples but this is most complex most dark most spectacular epic them all see it bale ledger music action nolans flawless direction 5 5 best film 2008 so far,0.5625615967780146,0.18630360104240704,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.32}"

Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart).

10.0,The dark and sinister mood of the film really sets the theme of the movie,"(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger's performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don't ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger's performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don't think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros.

10.0,Batman at his best and beyond,"Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can't see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn't made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen.",batman at his best beyond,batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since first time i heard about him because he his human with no powers also he is much more questionable than any other superhero story film is about batman lieutenant james gordon new district attorney harvey dent beginning succeed rounding up criminals that plague gotham city they are unexpectedly challenged when mysterious criminal mastermind known as joker appears gotham batmans struggle against joker becomes deeply personal forcing him confront everything he believes improve his technology which introduces recreation batcycle known as batpod batsuit was redesigned stop madmans campaign destruction during course film love triangle develops between bruce wayne dent rachel dawes there are now six batman films i must say that dark knight is best out all them title is good because that is what batman actually is it has been 3 years adventure continue batman begins but that entire wait was worth it gotham city is very gothic looking is very haunting visionary whole movie is charged with pulse pounding suspense ingenious special effects riveting performances first rate cast especially heath ledger who gave oscar nomination performance best supporting actor it is shame that he cant see his terrific work screen cinematography is excellent which is made so dark sinister that really did suit mood film usually sequels dont turn out be better than original but dark knight is one those rare sequels that surpasses original like godfather 2 i also really liked poster where building is fire bat symbol batman is standing front it christopher nolan is brilliant director his film memento is one my most favourite films he hasnt made 10 movies yet 3 them are already imdb top 250 overall dark knight is kind movie that will make audience cheer end instead throwing fruit vegetables screen,0.5509269715791454,0.24822840203274985,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.",sequel we deserved batman we wanted,i used leave theatre after seeing highly anticipated movie specifically sequel be so revved up about what i saw that i would declare that movie be best series after each prequel star wars films i rated that one best as good as any originals time until my opinion balanced out i had more well rounded take that reason i steer away that mindset did dark knight though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen warner bros screening last night dark knight ably stands its own with or without batman begins at two half hour runtime its definitely epic movie but one that never runs out gas delightful addition this experience was healthy amount imax footage which significantly adds feel being personal gruesome tour gotham city christian bale plays such well rounded batman bruce wayne qualities that none those who have donned cowl before him have pulled off i still have remember that bale is british since he speaks with such spot american accent bale has particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well charmingly bruce wayne threateningly batman countering him is late heath ledger who plays such scary creepy joker that i found it impossible not have chills half time i saw him screen what really separates this brand joker jack nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability its obvious that be good guy think like joker it really takes toll it sure isnt easy how exactly does one take him down when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages explosives or disappearing parlor tricks initially i was uneasy about how character harvey dent would be handled my mind there was really only one faithful portrayal him that could be found batman animated series early 90s as well as tommy lee jones could have handled him batman forever he certainly did not though it still was highlight that movie aaron eckhart ably assumes mantle here delivering performance out this world easily par with batman animated series be it known this caped avenger stands good gotham city that police force its counterparts cant represent good that has no jurisdiction no procedures no rules save one i can only hope that weve seen just prelude dark knights upcoming legendary battles with worst gotham citys dark underside dark knight gets solid 10 10 stars,0.5238946608946609,0.1523102453102453,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.,"I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet. But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film. To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'. While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest. And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too. But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast. Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate. Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...?  It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame. If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment. Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks. As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea. Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz. Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK. Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz. Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister! The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action. I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin), but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.",best comic movie ever,i thought batman begins was very well conceived put together movie we finally get batman as fully rendered character we gain new insight into his motivations variables he must contend with his role as protector gotham we get see gary oldman as honest goodness good guy we get see liam neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet but after seeing dark knight batman begins will forevermore be viewed by me at least as handy little prologue frickin masterpiece superhero film say its deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin calling nolan ledger joker bit eccentric while watching it i found myself thinking it was very long which is usually sign that its too long therefore boring but thats not actually case here script is bulging with ideas philosophical musings themes which christopher nolan is not content gloss over favour cool set pieces as many comic adaptations are but wants explore wants allow characters explore at logical pace so what i guess im saying is considering what it sets out do movie is long enough while still constantly holding viewers interest thats not say thematic exploration comes at expense big action either contrary there is some truly awesome stuff going here chase with truck example is fantastic theres some great hand hand stuff too but what engages us most is characters while script is brilliant dialogue is sharp quite funny first two thirds before drama really kicks this mainly comes down cast christian bale taller than michael keaton was more menacing than val kilmer was less like adam west than george clooney was solid committed as always he gives character life actually makes us feel him word tortured keeps coming mind i suppose its pretty appropriate heath ledger yknow id heard talk oscar nomination thought it sounded bit dubious batman villain winning oscar is that what its come then i thought is it because he didnt get one brokeback or more dubious still is it because he died but well how can i put it it seems bit blasphemous compare jack nicholson cesar romero but after seeing heath at work jack who once seemed so awesome just looks well lame if youve seen it you hopefully get what i mean if you havent you need you will discover true definition commitment maggie gyllenhaal i didnt have any problem with katie first one at time but i doubt she could have pulled off more emotional stuff rachel goes through here seeing recasting was necessary does tom have problem with his wife being involved with batman too many bad memories perhaps why am i even talking about such garbage here they could have done butt load worse than maggie she rocks as does aaron eckhart but im not giving anything away suffice it say my mind was blown again makes tommy lee jones look like you get idea michael caine still one my favourite actors alfred is shiz morgan freeman morgan freeman aok gary oldman as bb no mania no psychosis no nervous tics absolute subtlety manages hold his own alongside christian heath aaron without resorting parlour tricks sign spectacular talent go gaz eric roberts william fichtner michael jai white tiny lister whole thing is just big bag thoughtful well executed entertainment its equal parts cerebral visceral ideas action ive liked every batman movie so far okay besides batman robin but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary,0.5099707440256219,0.1462293668391229,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,"""I think you and I are destined to do this forever.""","So it finally happened, a DC Comics movie adaptation that out-marveled the Marvel folks, and to such a degree that it might be quite a while before anything comes close to topping ""The Dark Knight"". This was the severely grim and gritty version of the Batman, ushered in by Frank Miller's initial treatment in the landmark graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"" in 1986. Miller's portrayal of the iconic super hero took the gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes. The movie explores this theme at many levels, and would have served up enough of a plot to keep this viewer interested even without the explosions, chases and general mayhem that modern day audiences need to get their fix on. Actually, the Joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down from one of Batman's cables over the streets of Gotham, as noted in my summary line above. In the comic book world, they HAVE been fighting each other forever, or as long as forever exists since the creation of Batman back in 1939; the Joker came on the scene in 1940 in the comic, Batman #1.I don't think this could have been the same picture without Heath Ledger in the role of Batman's all time greatest nemesis. His portrayal blows away Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989's ""Batman"", and that's through no fault of Nicholson's. Today's films are a product of harsher and deadlier times, and it's striking that Ledger's characterization would define the Joker as an extremist, perhaps even a terrorist. More than once I found myself questioning what was going on during the opening bank robbery scene. The bad guys were offing each other based on instructions delivered by the Joker, and you suddenly come to the realization that this domino game had to end with one man standing. It's how we're introduced to Ledger's definitive Joker, a performance that won't be topped.Another thought came to me as I watched the story unfold, and that was how similar the coin toss gimmick paralleled the one in ""No Country For Old Men"". Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) began using the tactic following the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and I began picturing Javier Bardem in the role of The Joker. Hard to imagine who might have been the more evil character, Bardem's Anton Chigurh in a more realistic setting, or The Joker in a fictional Gotham City. Fortunately, not a choice one would normally have to consider.I'm a little bit on the fence as to Christian Bale's portrayal of The Batman. He's more than adequate as Bruce Wayne, but the voice he gives to the Dark Knight seems a bit melodramatic. Granted, he couldn't use the same voice as his alter ego, but there were times that it sounded so forced as to come across as parody, and other times just goofy, almost a throwback to the Adam West days of the TV Batman. Strange, but have you considered that no one ever calls him the Caped Crusader anymore either?All in all, great performances all around. Gary Oldman's portrayal of the new Commissioner Gordon was excellent, while Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox were solid even with limited screen time. I thought about Katie Holmes just once while making a mental comparison when Maggie Gyllenhaal first appeared on screen. Truthfully, they looked similar enough to effect the transition smoothly to the point where it wasn't distracting for me in the least.Obviously, the set up for the next sequel was firmly set in place with the creation of Two Face, the now alter ego of District Attorney Harvey Dent. The rendering of Dent's burned face was boldly executed and quite marvelous in it's own grotesque way. I'll be looking forward to the next installment.And NOW, for a personal rant. I probably should put this in parentheses because it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but for this picture to be #1 on the IMDb list of all time best movies after 4 days of release is incomprehensible, if not downright laughable (and I did rate it a 10 myself). I think there should be a moratorium of at least a couple of years before a film qualifies for IMDb ranking, giving the dust some time to settle from all the grand opening hoopla that surrounds a picture like this. I feel the same way about other recent movies like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"", both of which garnered numerous awards and fan approval. But if they're to be considered among the best films of all time, they'll be considered that way a decade from now without the need for multiple votes from over zealous fan boys.",i think you i are destined do this forever,so it finally happened dc comics movie adaptation that out marveled marvel folks such degree that it might be quite while before anything comes close topping dark knight this was severely grim gritty version batman ushered by frank millers initial treatment landmark graphic novel dark knight returns 1986 millers portrayal iconic super hero took gloves off as far as politically correct behavior goes movie explores this theme at many levels would have served up enough plot keep this viewer interested even without explosions chases general mayhem that modern day audiences need get their fix actually joker summed it all up quite brilliantly hanging upside down one batmans cables over streets gotham as noted my summary line above comic book world they have been fighting each other forever or as long as forever exists since creation batman back 1939 joker came scene 1940 comic batman i dont think this could have been same picture without heath ledger role batmans all time greatest nemesis his portrayal blows away jack nicholsons performance 1989s batman thats through no fault nicholsons todays films are product harsher deadlier times its striking that ledgers characterization would define joker as extremist perhaps even terrorist more than once i found myself questioning what was going during opening bank robbery scene bad guys were offing each other based instructions delivered by joker you suddenly come realization that this domino game had end with one man standing its how were introduced ledgers definitive joker performance that wont be topped another thought came me as i watched story unfold that was how similar coin toss gimmick paralleled one no country old men harvey dent aaron eckhart began using tactic following death rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal i began picturing javier bardem role joker hard imagine who might have been more evil character bardems anton chigurh more realistic setting or joker fictional gotham city fortunately not choice one would normally have consider im little bit fence as christian bales portrayal batman hes more than adequate as bruce wayne but voice he gives dark knight seems bit melodramatic granted he couldnt use same voice as his alter ego but there were times that it sounded so forced as come across as parody other times just goofy almost throwback adam west days tv batman strange but have you considered that no one ever calls him caped crusader anymore either all all great performances all around gary oldmans portrayal new commissioner gordon was excellent while michael caine as alfred morgan freeman as lucius fox were solid even with limited screen time i thought about katie holmes just once while making mental comparison when maggie gyllenhaal first appeared screen truthfully they looked similar enough effect transition smoothly point where it wasnt distracting me least obviously set up next sequel was firmly set place with creation two face now alter ego district attorney harvey dent rendering dents burned face was boldly executed quite marvelous its own grotesque way ill be looking forward next installment now personal rant i probably should put this parentheses because it doesnt have anything do with movie but this picture be imdb list all time best movies after 4 days release is incomprehensible if not downright laughable i did rate it 10 myself i think there should be moratorium at least couple years before film qualifies imdb ranking giving dust some time settle all grand opening hoopla that surrounds picture like this i feel same way about other recent movies like no country old men there will be blood both which garnered numerous awards fan approval but if theyre be considered among best films all time theyll be considered that way decade now without need multiple votes over zealous fan boys,0.46821543355634243,0.08973726715203989,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,"Best superhero movie, by far.","This is the best comic/DC/Marvel/Superhero genre movie ever made.Within its genre this stands on its own, there is nothing that comes even remotely close. A proper 10/10.

9.0,Finally...an IMDB rating that fits!,"Truly awe inspiring work from the director Christopher Nolan. Nolan does his work on a epic scale from the cinematography to the extras and effects, he doesn't shy away from compelling filmmaking including the awesome score from Hans Zimmer. I thoroughly enjoyed every part of this movie even down to its most basic aspects. But most of my loyalty to this film goes to Heath Ledger. His portrayal as the Joker has to be one of if not the greatest performance ever filmed. As a Batman movie you know that the Joker will lose but even knowing this I was cheering for the villain the whole time and I have never done that before nor since.",finally imdb rating that fits,truly awe inspiring work director christopher nolan nolan does his work epic scale cinematography extras effects he doesnt shy away compelling filmmaking including awesome score hans zimmer i thoroughly enjoyed every part this movie even down its most basic aspects but most my loyalty this film goes heath ledger his portrayal as joker has be one if not greatest performance ever filmed as batman movie you know that joker will lose but even knowing this i was cheering villain whole time i have never done that before nor since,0.6164529914529915,0.18803418803418806,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.25}"
