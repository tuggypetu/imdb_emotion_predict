10.0,More than just one meaning,"If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013",more than just one meaning,if you think someone being prisoner you automatically might think someone behind bars but apart physical prison prisoner can also be trapped mentally either by his own doing or by someone else this movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy it is carried by its actors gyllenhalls characters might seem odd out place at beginning even like cardboard cutout but he does have more do as movie progresses still front row seat is hugh jackman while some might argue that female should have bigger role this you only have so much time tell story this is perfectly told cut together it might not fit your description entertainment i dont think filmmaker would love it described as such but movie is really great if you like dramas general you should be cherishing this you will we have few grey areas that we visit ending did not satisfy everyone i know friends but movie could not have ended any other way my book superb movie one best released 2013,0.5051739926739927,0.19608974358974357,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,Excellent but not for all audiences,"A few words of warning about ""Prisoners"" before you try watching it. It's a very intense, violent and disturbing movie to say the least. While it is ranked #190 on IMBD's Top 250, it's NOT a film for everyone. . I mention this just to warn you...to think about this before you watch.As for me, while this isn't the sort of film I normally would watch, it's one I decided to see because it stars Jake Gyllenhaal. He's an actor who takes lots of risks and has appeared in many unique films which I enjoyed, such as ""Source Code"", ""Nightcrawler"", and ""Donnie Darko"". In fact, I cannot think of any conventional movies he's made...and you know you're in for a few surprises when you see his films...and this definitely is no exception.The story begins with two families having a dinner party. However, partway through the evening, the parents notice that the two youngest kids are gone. Where could they be?! The search the neighborhood but find no trace. The only clue is a tenuous one...a beat up RV was seen parked nearby.The police soon locate the RV and the driver. Instead of exiting the vehicle when the police order him out, he tries to run and is soon apprehended. It seems very likely the guy knows SOMETHING but since there's no real evidence, the police are forced to let him go. Unfortunately, the father of one of the abducted girls (Hugh Jackman) isn't going to let this go....and he abducts the man and keeps him prisoner...trying to get information from him. This portion is not for the squeamish.In the meantime, Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) has found leads on two other suspects. One is a priest with a corpse in his basement. Another is a freak who likes to buy childrens' clothing and who was first noticed at a vigil for the girls. He won't talk but keeps drawing mazes for the police....mazes that look like the necklace found on the corpse...and mazes which were mentioned by the man in captivity to his captor! All three are obsessed with mazes...so what has this to do with the missing girls?!The best thing about this film is that the screenplay is impossible to predict. If anyone tells you they could predict it, they're lying! Seriously! I appreciate a film that keeps me guessing and this one sure did. As for the acting, with Jackman and Gyllenhaal it's of course excellent. Overall, an amazing film...and an amazingly hard one to watch as well. It's certainly NOT for the squeamish!",excellent but not all audiences,few words warning about prisoners before you try watching it its very intense violent disturbing movie say least while it is ranked imbds top 250 its not film everyone i mention this just warn you think about this before you watch as me while this isnt sort film i normally would watch its one i decided see because it stars jake gyllenhaal hes actor who takes lots risks has appeared many unique films which i enjoyed such as source code nightcrawler donnie darko fact i cannot think any conventional movies hes made you know youre few surprises when you see his films this definitely is no exception story begins with two families having dinner party however partway through evening parents notice that two youngest kids are gone where could they be search neighborhood but find no trace only clue is tenuous one beat up rv was seen parked nearby police soon locate rv driver instead exiting vehicle when police order him out he tries run is soon apprehended it seems very likely guy knows something but since theres no real evidence police are forced let him go unfortunately father one abducted girls hugh jackman isnt going let this go he abducts man keeps him prisoner trying get information him this portion is not squeamish meantime detective loki gyllenhaal has found leads two other suspects one is priest with corpse his basement another is freak who likes buy childrens clothing who was first noticed at vigil girls he wont talk but keeps drawing mazes police mazes that look like necklace found corpse mazes which were mentioned by man captivity his captor all three are obsessed with mazes so what has this do with missing girls best thing about this film is that screenplay is impossible predict if anyone tells you they could predict it theyre lying seriously i appreciate film that keeps me guessing this one sure did as acting with jackman gyllenhaal its course excellent overall amazing film amazingly hard one watch as well its certainly not squeamish,0.5895464852607712,0.03623809523809523,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"""Finish all the mazes and you can go home.""","I didn't realize until I came to some of the reviews for this movie that it was two and a half hours long. It didn't seem like that while watching as one gets so engrossed in the story that time manages to fly by pretty quickly.I thought the plotting for the film was nearly flawless. The one thing I found exception to was when Detective Loki (Jake Gylenhaal) got distracted by the phone call from the department store clerk, he left Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) in the abandoned house and never bothered to return in a timely fashion. He had pretty good instincts about something going on there, so a quicker follow up would have been expected.Otherwise, I thought the screenplay and director Denis Villeneuve crafted an intricately weaved mystery surrounding the missing girls, with an abduction history going back a quarter of a decade. Those who find Keller's kidnapping of Alex Jones (Paul Dano) distasteful and his subsequent beating of Alex brutal, I'd have to agree that it was beyond the pale for a movie treatment. The beating part anyway. You could understand the man's frustration, but having no success in getting any information, he should have backed off long before he did.But even that part of it was handled well. Loki conceded to Grace Dover (Maria Bello) that her husband would probably go to jail, so there was no getting around the idea that Keller would get away with what he did. For his part, Gyllenhaal displayed another nuanced character in Detective Loki, just about a hundred eighty degree turn from his depiction of news gatherer Lou Bloom in ""Nightcrawler"". There were times he showed remarkable restraint dealing with Keller, making me think about the way cops in real life situations have to hold back on their emotions when dealing with distraught victims of a crime. He and the rest of the supporting cast put in very credible performances.",finish all mazes you can go home,i didnt realize until i came some reviews this movie that it was two half hours long it didnt seem like that while watching as one gets so engrossed story that time manages fly by pretty quickly i thought plotting film was nearly flawless one thing i found exception was when detective loki jake gylenhaal got distracted by phone call department store clerk he left keller dover hugh jackman abandoned house never bothered return timely fashion he had pretty good instincts about something going there so quicker follow up would have been expected otherwise i thought screenplay director denis villeneuve crafted intricately weaved mystery surrounding missing girls with abduction history going back quarter decade those who find kellers kidnapping alex jones paul dano distasteful his subsequent beating alex brutal id have agree that it was beyond pale movie treatment beating part anyway you could understand mans frustration but having no success getting any information he should have backed off long before he did but even that part it was handled well loki conceded grace dover maria bello that her husband would probably go jail so there was no getting around idea that keller would get away with what he did his part gyllenhaal displayed another nuanced character detective loki just about hundred eighty degree turn his depiction news gatherer lou bloom nightcrawler there were times he showed remarkable restraint dealing with keller making me think about way cops real life situations have hold back their emotions when dealing with distraught victims crime he rest supporting cast put very credible performances,0.46226666666666666,0.08206666666666669,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Wonderful Mystery That Keeps You Guessing Till the End,"Prisoners (2013) **** (out of 4) Incredibly well-made and intense mystery about two little girls who go missing and the detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) put on the case to find them. When the original suspect (Paul Dano) is let go, one of the girl's father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take justice in his own hands. I really had high hopes going into PRISONERS and my expectations for a great film were met but I must admit that it wasn't anywhere near the type of great film I expected. A lot of thrillers these days are limited on talk and emotions and instead we just get one big, staged action scene after another. That's certainly not the case here because the film takes its time (153-minutes) telling its story and there are so many quiet moments where we just see the characters losing their grip and emotions as they try to make sense of not knowing where these two girls are. What really pushes the film over the edge are the terrific performances with Jackson leading the way in what's the best performance I've seen from him. This isn't your ""loving"" father in the traditional sense. Instead he's someone quite scary from the first time we see him and we see how much worse he gets as the picture goes along. While on one hand you sympathize with his situation, on the other hand you really can't support what he's doing and often wonderful about his own involvement in things. Jackman really comes off like a man full of emotion and rage and he just doesn't know how to properly let it out. The anger he shows throughout the film is something so raw that you really do feel as if you're watching a man who has a daughter missing. Gyllenhaal also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played the detective role. I really loved the various obstacles that his character gets put through and especially the own weakness and at times stuck-up approach. The supporting cast includes wonderful performances by Dano, Melissa Leo, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. The screenplay isn't going to give you a lot of easy answers and there are many times where you hate the lead characters and can't find anything in them to root for. I thought it was quite brave that the film was willing to take so many chances and it asks the viewer to ask themselves many questions about how they would react to what's going on. I can't say I agreed with all the choices but it's great that a film actually makes you think as that's something quite rare these days. PRISONERS isn't exactly an ""enjoyable"" film as it has you feeling dirty throughout the running time but if you stick with it the thing is certainly very rewarding.",wonderful mystery that keeps you guessing till end,prisoners 2013 out 4 incredibly well made intense mystery about two little girls who go missing detective jake gyllenhaal put case find them when original suspect paul dano is let go one girls father hugh jackman decides take justice his own hands i really had high hopes going into prisoners my expectations great film were met but i must admit that it wasnt anywhere near type great film i expected lot thrillers these days are limited talk emotions instead we just get one big staged action scene after another thats certainly not case here because film takes its time 153 minutes telling its story there are so many quiet moments where we just see characters losing their grip emotions as they try make sense not knowing where these two girls are what really pushes film over edge are terrific performances with jackson leading way whats best performance ive seen him this isnt your loving father traditional sense instead hes someone quite scary first time we see him we see how much worse he gets as picture goes along while one hand you sympathize with his situation other hand you really cant support what hes doing often wonderful about his own involvement things jackman really comes off like man full emotion rage he just doesnt know how properly let it out anger he shows throughout film is something so raw that you really do feel as if youre watching man who has daughter missing gyllenhaal also deserves lot credit way he played detective role i really loved various obstacles that his character gets put through especially own weakness at times stuck up approach supporting cast includes wonderful performances by dano melissa leo terrence howard maria bello viola davis screenplay isnt going give you lot easy answers there are many times where you hate lead characters cant find anything them root i thought it was quite brave that film was willing take so many chances it asks viewer ask themselves many questions about how they would react whats going i cant say i agreed with all choices but its great that film actually makes you think as thats something quite rare these days prisoners isnt exactly enjoyable film as it has you feeling dirty throughout running time but if you stick with it thing is certainly very rewarding,0.5638741083477925,0.24993846796478378,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Hard to Watch but Really Well Done,"Two very good actors ply their trade very well. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a policeman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped little girls. Hugh Jackman plays a survivalist who ""prays for the best but expects the worst."" During Thanksgiving dinner, two little girls go up to a rusty old RV and shortly thereafter, disappear. The prime suspect is a mentally handicapped young man, the driver of the RV. But the girls are nowhere to be found. He is held for 48 hours and then released. It is then that Jackman takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps the young man and, convinced he knows everything, tortures him and beats him for days. Meanwhile, another suspect arises but Jackman can't handle this and keeps pounding away. There are numerous twists and turns that seem to work well. Gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself who has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps.

8.0,"a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller","Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html",gritty incredibly well acted suspenseful thought provoking crime drama thriller,prisoners is gritty incredibly well acted suspenseful thought provoking crime drama thriller film mainly focus choices taken consequences faced by characters when worst things happen them it simply raises question when your kids life is at stake how far are you willing do protect your family it explores likelihood human behaviour when such crime is happening us blurring lines between good bad people 153 minute movie story does unfolds at slow solemn pace which hurts film might bore some audiences but dramatic scenes performed by main cast members film will keep you engaged hugh jackman jack gyllenhaal both giving intense oscar worthy performances here defining developing their characters with various layers emotions affection anger grief empathy guilt throughout film films atmosphere heavy rains stormy days icy cold winter managed create dark dreadful environment make up dreary haunting mood film every violent action taken by characters are acts desperation given that they are running out time however film is not perfect despite some plot problems various twists turns shown film superb performances casts was sufficient enough make story succeed believable highly recommended those who wanted watch serious drama thriller with powerful engaging acting performances its talented casts,0.6401742160278745,-0.018048780487804866,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.31}"
8.0,'Prisoners' is a tightly wound thriller featuring career bests from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal...,"There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film ""Prisoners"" from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.The synopsis is fully in the trailer. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot-shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing. When a mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Dano) is found near the scene of the disappearance with no hard evidence, Keller takes matters into his own hands.I have to say that I've never been this hypnotized with the works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman, who is fresh of his inaugural nomination for Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"" has capitalized in a massive way. Approaching his character with the ferocity that made him a star in the ""X-Men"" franchises, he hammers his way into every scene, keeping the audience guessing about their own moral complexities. He tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done.When it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal, many, and probably for the right reasons, gravitate towards his work in Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" as his shining moment in film history. I believe he's gone deeper in works like ""Jarhead"" and ""Zodiac"" but those were just the surface of what he can do as an actor. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. He also orchestrates character beats and ticks that's reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's towering work in ""The Master"" last year.What is very refreshing in the film is it offers a great reminder of how brilliant an actor Terence Howard is. The Oscar-nominated actor seemed to fall by the wayside following his nomination for ""Hustle and Flow"" in 2006, coincidentally the same year Gyllenhaal snagged his first, and now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic and passionate characters. In a film that centers around his involvement, Paul Dano doesn't have too much to offer but is completely adequate in form.The film however is not entirely perfect. Aaron Guzikowski's depth screenplay offers a great mystery story, full of twists and turns, all the bit a tad predictable, but that's not where he falters so much. His construction of the female counterparts, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Melissa Leo, are not as crisply or smoothly put together as I'd like them to be. They each have one ""scene"" that gives us their character's motivation and the look into their cinematic psyche however, some are thrown in quite lazily and manages to halt the story in spots.The film's technical merits all rise to the abilities of its cast. Roger Deakins, the most overdue Cinematographer in the business, captures stunning portraits of conversations, weather, and scenes that continue to prove his brilliance in the film world. The film's score is masterfully placed by Jóhann Jóhannsson while Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film to an impeccable pace. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. I feel there's a shorter cut of the film that would surely be a Best Picture nominee for this year's Academy Awards if it existed. The film could still garner that support with what they have now, but I think there are aspects of the film members won't be able to get around. A high level of violence and torture scenes infused with a longer run time could keep people at a distance. One thing that can't be denied is the towering works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in ""Prisoners"" is cut and clear their best they've offered.""Prisoners"" is a magnificent achievement for the film year. Thorough, enigmatic, and purely amazing.

10.0,A brilliant masterpiece of atmosphere and suspense,"This was one intense movie-going experience. Throughout the entire running time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.The director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano's).

8.0,Jackman Shines in Villeneuve Classic,"Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper.

8.0,Long in length and high in suspense and tension,"That 'Prisoners' is directed by Denis Villeneuve, has cinematography by Roger Deakins and a music score from Johann Johannsson promised a big deal, having seen 'Sicario' and being blown away by its brilliance, especially in these areas. As did having a cast of talented actors such as Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo.'Prisoners' almost lives up to the acclaimed hype with most of the film being absolutely exceptional, but doesn't quite make it. Its only major stumbling block is that it spirals out of control towards the end, the tension does slip, there are big lapses in credibility and characters' actions and morality issues become implausible and much less believable. Having been so impressed with the rest of the film, this was a real pity. Maybe it is a little overlong too.On the other hand, Roger Deakins shows again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror. The production values in general are impeccably audacious and deeply haunting and the editing is suitably stylish.Johannsson's music score is suitably ominous and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation.Villeneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story.While the script is not quite as taut as that for 'Sicario', it does provoke thought and its unsettled nature hits hard. The story is not perfect, but a vast majority of it is nail-biting in tension, frightening in its suspense and very much edge of your seat. It is very violent and is not for the faint hearted because it is so vivid and the turn of events are unpredictable and devastating. It's deliberate in pacing but never dull, despite slacking towards the end.Characters are interesting, especially Jackman's increasingly unpredictable Keller Dover. You don't condone what he's done and his actions are extreme and one can sort of understand why he resorts to such drastic measures.Jackman is at his most hard-hitting, a shocking atypical performance that is among his best. Gyllenhaal is firm and understated, Dano is at his most unnerving and at times affecting and Terrence Howard gives one of the best performances he's ever given (showing that with the right material, like here, that he can be good).Davis and Leo, as to be expected, are outstanding, as is a poignant Maria Bello.In summary, 'Prisoners' may be long in length yet high in suspense and tension. It had all the makings of an exceptional film, and actually was for most of its running time, but that the ending disappoints as much it does it goes down to being a very good one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",long length high suspense tension,that prisoners is directed by denis villeneuve has cinematography by roger deakins music score johann johannsson promised big deal having seen sicario being blown away by its brilliance especially these areas as did having cast talented actors such as hugh jackman jake gyllenhaal paul dano viola davis melissa leo prisoners almost lives up acclaimed hype with most film being absolutely exceptional but doesnt quite make it its only major stumbling block is that it spirals out control towards end tension does slip there are big lapses credibility characters actions morality issues become implausible much less believable having been so impressed with rest film this was real pity maybe it is little overlong too other hand roger deakins shows again why he is one best contemporary cinematographers business with cinematography thats stunning darkly gritty also bringing out visceral horror production values general are impeccably audacious deeply haunting editing is suitably stylish johannssons music score is suitably ominous pulse pulsating one can actually feel their heart beat with tension anticipation villeneuves directing has beautiful darkness but also hard edge that is perfect story while script is not quite as taut as that sicario it does provoke thought its unsettled nature hits hard story is not perfect but vast majority it is nail biting tension frightening its suspense very much edge your seat it is very violent is not faint hearted because it is so vivid turn events are unpredictable devastating its deliberate pacing but never dull despite slacking towards end characters are interesting especially jackmans increasingly unpredictable keller dover you dont condone what hes done his actions are extreme one can sort understand why he resorts such drastic measures jackman is at his most hard hitting shocking atypical performance that is among his best gyllenhaal is firm understated dano is at his most unnerving at times affecting terrence howard gives one best performances hes ever given showing that with right material like here that he can be good davis leo as be expected are outstanding as is poignant maria bello summary prisoners may be long length yet high suspense tension it had all makings exceptional film actually was most its running time but that ending disappoints as much it does it goes down being very good one 8 10 bethany cox,0.6127303956408435,0.15882077706704564,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
7.0,A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity,"Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. A spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the ""goody-two-shoes"" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. And holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. Speaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. Furthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and ""fun,"" such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",true terrific exploration moral ambiguity,wow what intensely suspenseful film prisoners was film commences with naturalistic peaceful look suburban neighborhood leafless trees calmly swaying along with cool air that encompass them all is fine perfectly normal family visits their friends neighbors delightful dinner some music everything is fine dandy until both familys two kids run off retrieve toy they left outside after pleasant conversation two families begin realize that their kids havent gotten back yet noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing chaos breaks loose we are suddenly presented with ruthless father played by hugh jackman who loves his daughter so much that hes willing transcend any morally difficult obstacles hopefully locate her spectacular cast ranging likes hugh jackman jake gyllenhaal viola davis terrence howard create such chilling atmosphere that everyone audience immediately notices discomforting subject matter as they prepare disturbing viewing one should know prior visiting movie theater that this film doesnt feature morally perfect individuals they are all human beings cast into unbelievably frightening situation this is where larges amounts debate will stir theres one side audience that will persistently detest characters actions characters themselves theres other side which i am proudly part that will essentially understand that people cant possibly always be goody two shoes heroes perceived hollywood blockbusters reality that by god i will partake morally ethically questionable activities save precious loved one absolutely such conversation argument is healthy it proves memorability factor film itself after you witness terrifically crafted picture you will find enjoyment discussing movies events with friends family with eventually two sides forming over talk holy crap is hugh jackman entirely convincing his performance you can see longing find his sweet innocent daughter through his miserable eyes filled with redness desperation anger then theres jake gyllenhaal as second lead playing ambitious cop who holds very impressive resume no unsolved cases left under his plate can that mean his skill will greatly help this predicament similar note paul dano takes prize after hugh jackman another wonderful performance no offense or anything but he completely fits into these immensely creepy eerie roles speaking soundtrack will definitely remain that shocked mind yours long after youve left theater because it fills us with sense hopelessness discomfort at times it sounds exceptionally ominous with disconcerting sound those violins play at others it sounds like music weeps all those involved pace never seems drag even though it clocks at around 150 minutes as you remain at edge seat entire time utterly perplexed by everything thats transpiring wholly befuddled by choices that these people are making film will make you cringe question humanity participants or competence our law that word could mean two things although i was slightly disappointed with end result majority film strongly intrigued me oh how could i forget cinematography is simply amazing roger deakins brilliant cinematographer behind last years skyfall manages camera work this film as well as one wise critic said drive rain never felt so disquieting moment foreboding furthermore i would not recommend skipping out prisoners unless youre type that prefers more lighthearted fun movies like avengers if you love films that explore more than just entertainment fun such as important themes moral ambiguity as whole you cannot go wrong with prisoners with mix top notch cinematography remarkably unsettling music superb performances thrilling powerful story prisoners will definitely be one this years features that ill surely be remembering true cinema season has started now lets hope every film here out delivers like this one did,0.6180395299145299,0.12373076923076924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
7.0,Crime Story For Adults.,"There is a scene in ""On Dangerous Ground"" (1951) in which half-crazy detective Robert Ryan is about to beat the living crap out of a suspect to gain information. Ryan's features twist into a pustule of hate, hardly human. ""Why do you DO it? Why do you punks make me DO it?"" And then he goes frantically to work.This is a a more complex story of the kidnapping of two little girls and the lengths to which the parents and police are willing to go to either retrieve the victims or find the bodies. But the most complicated character, the father who engages our interest because he instrumentalizes his grief and anger (Jackman), does more or less what Ryan does in the earlier film. He goes berserk, tramples on the law, and reduces a half-wit that he suspects to a bloody pulp.There are harmonies in the sometimes torpid story that I didn't quite get or wasn't sure of. There are ominous organ chords, a drunken priest who is a red herring, and references to penance. There's a candle light vigil for the girls. It's deep enough, even without any spiritual content. After all, when you get right down to it, the question raised by Jackman's tactics is: ""How far is it ethical to go in torturing a prisoner, even in a good cause?"" It's a medieval issue but recently a more contemporary one.It's a long movie -- too long, really -- and it could have benefited from more ruthless cutting, yet it all adds up. The director, Villeneuve, effectively captures the drab aspects of working-class life in one of those flat, brick, ranch-type residential neighborhoods on the outskirts of a small town in Pennsylvania, actually shot in Georgia.The acting is, well, hard to describe in a word but maybe ""naturalistic"" will do. It's something like ""All The President's Men"" in that respect. The kidding around and the hesitations and interruptions don't sound as if they were being read from cue cards.Jackman is fine as the enraged father who is determined to beat a confession out of his retarded prisoner, but he's not a sadist. He doesn't ENJOY doing it. And the scenes are truncated, avoiding the nasty current affection for torture porn that has infected movies like ""Unthinkable"" or the unbearable ""The Killing Gene."" The viewer is likely to be ""for"" or ""against"" the other characters but Jackman's is problematic. He's not just rude or irrational. He's brutal. It's what makes it the most interesting role.In fact, everyone pulls his or her weight, but Maria Bello is truly impressive, though she doesn't have that much screen time. And Mellisa Leo as the mother of the chief suspect is outstanding. One of those distant, suspicious, kindly authoritative, slightly sour Midwesterners, though she's from New York.The ending collapses in upon itself. People do idiotic things like search dangerous places without calling for back up. Without warning, a familiar character splits open and reveals the demon within. Cliché follows cliché. I still don't exactly understand it. The rest is tense, involving, quite well done.",crime story adults,there is scene dangerous ground 1951 which half crazy detective robert ryan is about beat living crap out suspect gain information ryans features twist into pustule hate hardly human why do you do it why do you punks make me do it then he goes frantically work this is more complex story kidnapping two little girls lengths which parents police are willing go either retrieve victims or find bodies but most complicated character father who engages our interest because he instrumentalizes his grief anger jackman does more or less what ryan does earlier film he goes berserk tramples law reduces half wit that he suspects bloody pulp there are harmonies sometimes torpid story that i didnt quite get or wasnt sure there are ominous organ chords drunken priest who is red herring references penance theres candle light vigil girls its deep enough even without any spiritual content after all when you get right down it question raised by jackmans tactics is how far is it ethical go torturing prisoner even good cause its medieval issue but recently more contemporary one its long movie too long really it could have benefited more ruthless cutting yet it all adds up director villeneuve effectively captures drab aspects working class life one those flat brick ranch type residential neighborhoods outskirts small town pennsylvania actually shot georgia acting is well hard describe word but maybe naturalistic will do its something like all presidents men that respect kidding around hesitations interruptions dont sound as if they were being read cue cards jackman is fine as enraged father who is determined beat confession out his retarded prisoner but hes not sadist he doesnt enjoy doing it scenes are truncated avoiding nasty current affection torture porn that has infected movies like unthinkable or unbearable killing gene viewer is likely be or against other characters but jackmans is problematic hes not just rude or irrational hes brutal its what makes it most interesting role fact everyone pulls his or her weight but maria bello is truly impressive though she doesnt have that much screen time mellisa leo as mother chief suspect is outstanding one those distant suspicious kindly authoritative slightly sour midwesterners though shes new york ending collapses upon itself people do idiotic things like search dangerous places without calling back up without warning familiar character splits open reveals demon within clich follows clich i still dont exactly understand it rest is tense involving quite well done,0.5201101029868153,-0.03738782146316392,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,Spellbinding,"Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis.

8.0,One of the most chilling thriller movies I have ever seen.,"""Prisoners"" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.This film doesn't use jumpscares (often precluded by suspenseful music to build-up the tension and are often abused in this genre) in order to thrill the audience, but rather, moments of silence and stillness. Its calm and cold vibe stirs up the kind of anxiety it wants its audience to feel, and naturally, the audience would want to get rid of that uneasiness by knowing what's going on, thus, cleverly forcing them to watch the entire film which runs about 2 hrs and 33 mins.The director, Denis Villeneuve, incorporates his ""less is more"" style of using soundtracks in this movie (just like what he did with Blade Runner 2049) to emphasize the scenes, especially with the ending (heavens know how much I liked that ending). It's not rocket suspense but the simplicity of it makes your mind wander to other possibilities which I think is often a good indication of a brilliant film since it's open for other interpetations.However, one thing that won't make me rate this a perfect 9 or 8 is the fact that I'm not entirely convinced on the motivation of the antagonists for doing the things they did. It felt a bit rushed (for the lack of a better word) and while it makes sense, it doesn't leave me satisfied",one most chilling thriller movies i have ever seen,prisoners is rich compelling narratives stellar performances ensemble cast this movie had me love hate hugh jackmans character which was so complex point making me question my moral standards because i found myself empathizing with his character other hand jake gyllenhaal did marvelous job playing frustrated cop complete with all intensity his eyes his intuition while gyllenhaal had more screentime as lead jackmans performance really stood out me this film doesnt use jumpscares often precluded by suspenseful music build up tension are often abused this genre order thrill audience but rather moments silence stillness its calm cold vibe stirs up kind anxiety it wants its audience feel naturally audience would want get rid that uneasiness by knowing whats going thus cleverly forcing them watch entire film which runs about 2 hrs 33 mins director denis villeneuve incorporates his less is more style using soundtracks this movie just like what he did with blade runner 2049 emphasize scenes especially with ending heavens know how much i liked that ending its not rocket suspense but simplicity it makes your mind wander other possibilities which i think is often good indication brilliant film since its open other interpetations however one thing that wont make me rate this perfect 9 or 8 is fact that im not entirely convinced motivation antagonists doing things they did it felt bit rushed lack better word while it makes sense it doesnt leave me satisfied,0.6048611111111113,0.1763888888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.38}"

8.0,A definite contender for best thriller of 2013,"Even if he already worked for over 20 years before that, director Denis Villeneuve rose to fame considerably after giving audiences his 2010 film ""Incendies"", a nominee for the Best Foreign Language Oscar. With ""prisoners"" he directed his very first English-language movie. Two young girls disappear and the film centers on the father (Jackman) of one of them and the cop (Gyllenhaal) investigating what might have happened to them. Jackman, who already gave one of my favorite performances last year with his impressive turn as Jean Valjean, delivers again as a father who does what needs to be done to save his daughter's life and Gyllenhaal, who I've never been that big of a fan, impressed me as well. His portrayal of a loner, in his profession as well as his private life, gave me the chills occasionally and proves that he can pull off characters that go far beyond the pretty boy / nice guy image.Mostly thanks to its two leads and very atmospheric images and music, this film turned out a success and kept me on the edge of the seat for almost all of its very long 2.5 hours. It gets slightly worse when the secret behind the disappearances gets uncovered, just because most of the quiet tension vanishes and more action ensues, but it's still pretty decent. The invisible danger is far more effective than the danger from Melissa Leo when she gets exposed as the grandma from hell. She and the whole supporting cast do a decent job overall and Dano (especially), Leo, Davis and Howard did a fine job with what they were given and all have at least one scene where they can shine and command the screen. The only one who kinda left me unimpressed was Maria Bello. Once again. Guess I'm just not a great fan of her. Besides that, there were certain flaws here and there, such as the whole maze reference or the introduction of the husband to Leo's character, but looking at the whole picture, those were really just minor factors that can't remotely hurt the overall perception.

8.0,This is a good movie in my opinion.,"The Good: 1. Acting, i should say that this is one of the best performances for both leading actors. Hugh Jackman was incredible. 2. Plot and characterization, well i can expected that by seeing the director's name. One of the best crime-thriller ever made, keep you sucked into the plot. 3. Cinematography, genius Deakins success to build the tense of the film only by his work. Film atmosphere was really good. The Bad: Overlong and the original score not pretty good to lived up the film. I mean, Johann was a really good composer, especially his work in Sicario and Arrival, but it's not work here. Conclusion: Many good aspects of the film, but its just good, not amazing.",this is good movie my opinion,good 1 acting i should say that this is one best performances both leading actors hugh jackman was incredible 2 plot characterization well i can expected that by seeing directors name one best crime thriller ever made keep you sucked into plot 3 cinematography genius deakins success build tense film only by his work film atmosphere was really good bad overlong original score not pretty good lived up film i mean johann was really good composer especially his work sicario arrival but its not work here conclusion many good aspects film but its just good not amazing,0.5956439393939393,0.3229166666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.3, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.17}"

8.0,Prisoners is compelling enough when being ambiguous about the way things eventually turn out,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who watched this yesterday though he didn't mind seeing it again. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are quite compelling as a frustrated parent of a missing child and a police detective who tries to do everything right in finding this child, respectively. They both go after different suspects and it's quite interesting what the results are. Plenty of points-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative. One might be disappointed at the way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could happen, one should still be partially informed enough as to the eventual conclusion. In summary, Prisoners could be good enough for anyone not minding everything not spelled out in a neat tidy package.",prisoners is compelling enough when being ambiguous about way things eventually turn out,just watched this with my movie theatre working friend who watched this yesterday though he didnt mind seeing it again hugh jackman jake gyllenhaal are quite compelling as frustrated parent missing child police detective who tries do everything right finding this child respectively they both go after different suspects its quite interesting what results are plenty points views methods which suspect is guilty abound it got me hooked most narrative one might be disappointed at way things end but since dialogue offers clues as what could happen one should still be partially informed enough as eventual conclusion summary prisoners could be good enough anyone not minding everything not spelled out neat tidy package,0.47556390977443613,0.049248120300751874,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.21}"
9.0,"Be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.","Prisoners is directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Aaron Guzikowski. It stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Music is by Jóhann Jóhannsson and cinematography by Roger Deakins.When Keller Dover's (Jackman) daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands...At first glance of the plot synopis, one could be forgiven for thinking this is yet another revenge thriller filled out by police procedural side-bars. How pleasant to find that Prisoners has more to offer than a simple who is the criminal? And just how far will a vengeful father go to satiate his grief?.Prisoners is such an apt title because all the main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims of their innocence, guilt or chaotic impulses. It's a multi stranded character piece that poses many questions, while of course it has a big mystery element. The narrative features a whole host of clues that might be something, or not, unanswered questions dangle throughout until the finale reveals thge edgy secrets.It's safe to say that the themes at work here are dark and upsetting, with the core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories, torture and religious mania. Gruzikowski's screenplay is quality, mesmerising even, there's no lazy filler or extranous sequences, even as the jigsaw pieces are put together in the last quarter, you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple?.This was Villeneuve's first English language picture, and it's not hard to see why he was highly touted as one of the next big director beings - his output that followed subsequently bears this out. His control of mood and pacing is superb, his garnering of high quality perfs from his cast (notably Jackman and Gyllenhaal) is impressive, and his teaming with the great Deakins is a match made in photographic heaven.This is adult film making, a thriller designed to illicit emotional responses from the audience. Relentless and powerful, a troubling examination of the human conditioning in various guises - and we are witnesses. 9/10",be prepared worst but hope best pray best but prepare worst,prisoners is directed by denis villeneuve written by aaron guzikowski it stars hugh jackman jake gyllenhaal viola davis terence howard maria bello melissa leo paul dano music is by j hann j hannsson cinematography by roger deakins when keller dovers jackman daughter her friend go missing he takes matters into his own hands at first glance plot synopis one could be forgiven thinking this is yet another revenge thriller filled out by police procedural side bars how pleasant find that prisoners has more offer than simple who is criminal just how far will vengeful father go satiate his grief prisoners is such apt title because all main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims their innocence guilt or chaotic impulses its multi stranded character piece that poses many questions while course it has big mystery element narrative features whole host clues that might be something or not unanswered questions dangle throughout until finale reveals thge edgy secrets its safe say that themes at work here are dark upsetting with core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories torture religious mania gruzikowskis screenplay is quality mesmerising even theres no lazy filler or extranous sequences even as jigsaw pieces are put together last quarter you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple this was villeneuves first english language picture its not hard see why he was highly touted as one next big director beings his output that followed subsequently bears this out his control mood pacing is superb his garnering high quality perfs his cast notably jackman gyllenhaal is impressive his teaming with great deakins is match made photographic heaven this is adult film making thriller designed illicit emotional responses audience relentless powerful troubling examination human conditioning various guises we are witnesses 9 10,0.47748511904761903,0.1456423611111111,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,"Mesmerizing, Ambiguous and Gritty Thriller","On the Thanksgiving, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello), their teenage son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and their little daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) go to the home of their neighbors and friends Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), his wife Nancy (Viola Davis), their teenage daughter Eliza (Zoë Soul) and their little daughter Joy (Kyla-Drew Simmons) to celebrate together in a lunch party. Anna and Joy want to play on the street and Ralph stays with them. The girls play in a ROV and Ralph brings them back home. Later Anna asks her father to go to their house with Joy to seek her emergency whistle and Keller tells her to call Ralph or Eliza to go with them.Later the families realize that the girls went alone have vanished and they call the police department. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and he arrests the teenager Alex Jones (Paul Dano) that drives the trailer. Soon they learn that Alex has the IQ of a ten year-old boy and he is discharged. When he is leaving the precinct with his aunt Holly Jones (Melissa Leo), Keller presses Alex and he says to Keller that ""the girls have not cried when he left them"". Keller asks to keep Alex imprisoned during the investigations, but Loki cannot hold him anymore. While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong. ""Prisoners"" is a mesmerizing, ambiguous and gritty thriller about the kidnapping of two girls by a sick serial-killer. The plot is divided in interesting premises that raise the discussion of what is right and what is wrong when the life of your daughter is in danger. Is Keller right or wrong abducting Alex after listening to what he told him? The police work is flawed, leaving Alex without surveillance just like in the real world. This movie has magnificent cast and cinematography and the story has glimpses of the dark Franc-Dutch ""Spoorloos"" (1988). The open conclusion is another plus in this movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Os Suspeitos"" (""The Suspects"")",mesmerizing ambiguous gritty thriller,thanksgiving keller dover hugh jackman his wife grace maria bello their teenage son ralph dylan minnette their little daughter anna erin gerasimovich go home their neighbors friends franklin birch terrence howard his wife nancy viola davis their teenage daughter eliza zo soul their little daughter joy kyla drew simmons celebrate together lunch party anna joy want play street ralph stays with them girls play rov ralph brings them back home later anna asks her father go their house with joy seek her emergency whistle keller tells her call ralph or eliza go with them later families realize that girls went alone have vanished they call police department detective loki jake gyllenhaal is assigned case he arrests teenager alex jones paul dano that drives trailer soon they learn that alex has iq ten year old boy he is discharged when he is leaving precinct with his aunt holly jones melissa leo keller presses alex he says keller that girls have not cried when he left them keller asks keep alex imprisoned during investigations but loki cannot hold him anymore while detective loki investigates pedophiles near location keller decides abduct alex torture him find where his beloved daughter her friend are crossing thin line between right wrong prisoners is mesmerizing ambiguous gritty thriller about kidnapping two girls by sick serial killer plot is divided interesting premises that raise discussion what is right what is wrong when life your daughter is danger is keller right or wrong abducting alex after listening what he told him police work is flawed leaving alex without surveillance just like real world this movie has magnificent cast cinematography story has glimpses dark franc dutch spoorloos 1988 open conclusion is another plus this movie my vote is nine title brazil os suspeitos suspects,0.4640692640692642,0.08538961038961038,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"
