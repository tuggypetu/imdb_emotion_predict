10.0,Great,"To make this short and quick, PK is a movie which includes drama and comedy. It focuses on a very serious topic using those two categories to further advance the plot. I recommend this movie for anyone who has watched any other movies of Rajkumar Hirani's, as well as to any one who finds satirical comedies interesting to watch. Once you watch the movie for yourself you might agree with me, that the movie delivers on what it has to offer.",great,make this short quick pk is movie which includes drama comedy it focuses very serious topic using those two categories further advance plot i recommend this movie anyone who has watched any other movies rajkumar hiranis as well as any one who finds satirical comedies interesting watch once you watch movie yourself you might agree with me that movie delivers what it has offer,0.5416666666666667,0.15357142857142855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.3, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.1}"
10.0,Hirani takes innovation and creative thinking to a different level,"While entering the theater, I was excited and so were many people in my vicinity. Being a Rajkumar Hirani flick, one can hardly expect disappointing but you never really know. After 3 idiots in 2009, it took Hirani a hiatus of five years to come up with PK. But does this deliver enough to live up to its promise? Well, I feel proud to say this, Hirani has not let us down. Aamir Khan this time in PK has left no stone unturned and has put in his best for his role. From his physique to his language, the actor is simply brilliant. Indulging himself in a role of an innocent outsider(the role which suits Aamir perfectly), he speaks more with his expressions than any of the actors do with their words. With Aamir on the frontier, it is hardly fair game for the remnant of the crew to show their finesse. Quite to the contrary, Anushka plays an adequately important role in doing her best to ameliorate the humour. Sanjay Dutt who appears in parts is also fabulous. Now, the screenplay. Magnificent. Every dialogue and the successive is written, furnished and polished with extreme care and prowess. Music by Ankit Tiwari does not differ from the director's previous movies, they are quite decent and go hand in hand with the plot. I went to the theater excited and came out learning something. PK is a movie which entertains you every minute with its creativity in successfully creating an atmosphere of humour and exuberance. PK is out to provoke but not to shock. The film asks questions via its idiot savant protagonist, but does not attempt to deliver facile, absolute answers. And that makes it all the more effective. PK is an adventure which will make you laugh heartily, make you feel heart rended and make you learn to let go, simultaneously promulgating a message. PK is something i would describe, as an emotional roller-coaster. PK is an experience of a life time.If you have people with orthodox thinking in your proximity or people who are led to blind beliefs of religious drama or are puritanical, PK is just the movie for them. For others, this goes without saying, a must watch.My rating - ""An emotional masterpiece"" Traditional rating - 9.5/10.",hirani takes innovation creative thinking different level,while entering theater i was excited so were many people my vicinity being rajkumar hirani flick one can hardly expect disappointing but you never really know after 3 idiots 2009 it took hirani hiatus five years come up with pk but does this deliver enough live up its promise well i feel proud say this hirani has not let us down aamir khan this time pk has left no stone unturned has put his best his role his physique his language actor is simply brilliant indulging himself role innocent outsider role which suits aamir perfectly he speaks more with his expressions than any actors do with their words with aamir frontier it is hardly fair game remnant crew show their finesse quite contrary anushka plays adequately important role doing her best ameliorate humour sanjay dutt who appears parts is also fabulous now screenplay magnificent every dialogue successive is written furnished polished with extreme care prowess music by ankit tiwari does not differ directors previous movies they are quite decent go hand hand with plot i went theater excited came out learning something pk is movie which entertains you every minute with its creativity successfully creating atmosphere humour exuberance pk is out provoke but not shock film asks questions via its idiot savant protagonist but does not attempt deliver facile absolute answers that makes it all more effective pk is adventure which will make you laugh heartily make you feel heart rended make you learn let go simultaneously promulgating message pk is something i would describe as emotional roller coaster pk is experience life time if you have people with orthodox thinking your proximity or people who are led blind beliefs religious drama or are puritanical pk is just movie them others this goes without saying must watch my rating emotional masterpiece traditional rating 9 5 10,0.6420138888888889,0.2116035353535354,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.2}"
9.0,P.assed with first K.ilass,"Director Mr. Raj Kumar Hirani have different sensibilities, which he proved again. His style of depiction of a serious subject on a light note with humor toppings are again delicious. I love, respect and support this subject so there would be changes of being little positively biased. This is a very good extension of one of my favorite flick ""Oh My God"". That one was of single plot but PK is multi plotted. Story is just to support and explore the basic idea of film but it's interesting. Screenplay by Director himself and Abhijit Joshi is fresh, logical and different even being very close to ""Oh My God"". Dialogues by director and writer duo are perfect and logical. In a scene, where Amir Khan is emotionally broken then blast in the background enhances the intensity and carry forward the story ahead very smoothly. The use of old song in a very light note or serious note is also interesting especially ""Pardesi Pardesi Jana Nahi"" in beginning and ""Aasman Mein Hai Khuda Aur Zameein par Hum"" in between the film, is good tribute and use of songs. Now this type of film must have been made to rebel the business of fear. We should change our lifestyle by not being God fearing but becoming God loving. Hope such type of films will make changes even a little. Love is a side track but it's very good and emotional with a message too. I personally feel that after a long gap this movie has repeat value. Performance wise Hats off to Amir Khan. He is absolute perfect and first time I witnessed him, doing fantastic in emotional scenes too. He needs extra praising for always choosing something different subject with a message too. Anushka Sharma is fantastic. Her look is different and expressions are very real. Sanjay Dutt is endearing. Shaurav Shukla and Parikshat Sahni are very good. Sushant Singh Rajput is fine. Boman Irani is impressive. Music is melodious, lyrics are perfect. Both gel with the mood and subject of the film very well.",p assed with first k ilass,director mr raj kumar hirani have different sensibilities which he proved again his style depiction serious subject light note with humor toppings are again delicious i love respect support this subject so there would be changes being little positively biased this is very good extension one my favorite flick oh my god that one was single plot but pk is multi plotted story is just support explore basic idea film but its interesting screenplay by director himself abhijit joshi is fresh logical different even being very close oh my god dialogues by director writer duo are perfect logical scene where amir khan is emotionally broken then blast background enhances intensity carry forward story ahead very smoothly use old song very light note or serious note is also interesting especially pardesi pardesi jana nahi beginning aasman mein hai khuda aur zameein par hum between film is good tribute use songs now this type film must have been made rebel business fear we should change our lifestyle by not being god fearing but becoming god loving hope such type films will make changes even little love is side track but its very good emotional with message too i personally feel that after long gap this movie has repeat value performance wise hats off amir khan he is absolute perfect first time i witnessed him doing fantastic emotional scenes too he needs extra praising always choosing something different subject with message too anushka sharma is fantastic her look is different expressions are very real sanjay dutt is endearing shaurav shukla parikshat sahni are very good sushant singh rajput is fine boman irani is impressive music is melodious lyrics are perfect both gel with mood subject film very well,0.5896153261942735,0.2823539910382016,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.19}"

9.0,Wow - I was not expecting this.,"This is a comedy about a guy who is naked in the middle of nowhere in a desert along some railroad tracks with nothing but a boom-box who is struggling, like so many of us do, with the failed promises of religion. All he wants ... is his remote back. I am a huge Aamir Khan fan and I loved 3 Idiots. In fact, I have the love song Zoobie Doobie as my ring tone. So - as soon as they announced this movie - I knew I wanted to see it. The marketing campaign only peaked my interest more. Why is Aamir naked in the middle of the desert with a boom-box? This is the question even my son was asking. Why? Who is his character. Then - they put out the posters - and - who the heck is this PK character.Well - let me just say - I had no idea that this was going to be the plot. Wow. Let's start with the disclaimer - we don't intend to offend anyone's religion. I'm thinking - OK - I wonder what that's all about. Well, that disclaimer has to go down in history as one of the biggest understatements in all of film history.Then the opening sequence. And, I'm thinking - wow - this is REALLY a) mind blowing and b) humanistic. Being a Humanist, I loved it - but it seemed a bit extreme for an Indian movie given that India is such a religious country. Having such a science based opening with the philosophy that goes with it - was a bit shocking. I loved it, but it was totally unexpected because it was so expansive.The foundation of this film is the struggle of someone to come to terms with the failed promises of religion. And it's REALLY funny. I saw it in a nearly sold out theater in America and people were applauding some of the most pointed critiques of religious practice - not because they were anti-religious - but because it was pro-human. There are some really funny moments in this movie, like Aamir trying to bring wine into a mosque had the entire audience laughing. Again, not because it was making fun of Muslims, but because of how clueless the character PK is. It's also heartbreaking - stunningly so. And as I've been digesting this movie over the past day or so - I realize that the artistic choices to break our hearts in the way this movie does - was incredibly well done. It's so sudden and unexpected that it's perfect for the story line and the social point they are making. Even the ending is really astonishing. Aamir is just staring at a shoe in his hand, and yet, what is happening around him is creating so much tension. And you know how it's going to end, but that doesn't make you any less tense hoping that it will end how you want it to. They built the tension up and released it perfectly and Aamir's performance, as understated as it was - because he was just looking at a shoe, was amazing. I was shocked by this film, but in a really good way. If you are a Humanist, you really need to see this film. If you are religious, but frustrated with the con men speaking on behalf of your faith - see this film. You won't be disappointed. As someone said as I passed by - it's about time someone said what we have all been thinking.",wow i was not expecting this,this is comedy about guy who is naked middle nowhere desert along some railroad tracks with nothing but boom box who is struggling like so many us do with failed promises religion all he wants is his remote back i am huge aamir khan fan i loved 3 idiots fact i have love song zoobie doobie as my ring tone so as soon as they announced this movie i knew i wanted see it marketing campaign only peaked my interest more why is aamir naked middle desert with boom box this is question even my son was asking why who is his character then they put out posters who heck is this pk character well let me just say i had no idea that this was going be plot wow lets start with disclaimer we dont intend offend anyones religion im thinking ok i wonder what thats all about well that disclaimer has go down history as one biggest understatements all film history then opening sequence im thinking wow this is really mind blowing b humanistic being humanist i loved it but it seemed bit extreme indian movie given that india is such religious country having such science based opening with philosophy that goes with it was bit shocking i loved it but it was totally unexpected because it was so expansive foundation this film is struggle someone come terms with failed promises religion its really funny i saw it nearly sold out theater america people were applauding some most pointed critiques religious practice not because they were anti religious but because it was pro human there are some really funny moments this movie like aamir trying bring wine into mosque had entire audience laughing again not because it was making fun muslims but because how clueless character pk is its also heartbreaking stunningly so as ive been digesting this movie over past day or so i realize that artistic choices break our hearts way this movie does was incredibly well done its so sudden unexpected that its perfect story line social point they are making even ending is really astonishing aamir is just staring at shoe his hand yet what is happening around him is creating so much tension you know how its going end but that doesnt make you any less tense hoping that it will end how you want it they built tension up released it perfectly aamirs performance as understated as it was because he was just looking at shoe was amazing i was shocked by this film but really good way if you are humanist you really need see this film if you are religious but frustrated with con men speaking behalf your faith see this film you wont be disappointed as someone said as i passed by its about time someone said what we have all been thinking,0.5618173258003767,0.11332391713747646,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.29}"
7.0,'Pk' a hilarious and entertaining movie........,"""Pk"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year, may be for Aamir Khan, Raj Kumar Hirani, or the promising promos of the film. The film tries to see the world through the eyes of an alien who has no idea of what the life in the earth is like. Through this character the film tries to make a satire to different religions and the stubbornness of the religions and the god men (managers of the god as described in the movie). In the aspect, the subject doesn't come strongly than Paresh Rawal's ""OMG: Oh My God"" in which the debate on the existence of god and religions was stronger and interesting. Anyway, the questions put in the first half and the representation of different religions are pretty witty and hold the audiences to the edge of their seats.However, the film doesn't stick to a single issue and delves much into the melodrama which makes it a light entertaining movie than a strong social issue based movie. On a whole. the film appears an amalgam of many popular movies like ""3 Idiots,""Lage Raho Munna Bhai"" or ""OMG."" However, the alien as a protagonist and the way he deals and asks the simple questions on basic truths of life make this film entertaining and novel. Overall, Aamir Khan steals the show. Anushka Sharma, Saurabh Sukla, Parikshit Sahni also deliver good performances. Direction of Raj Kumar Hirani is similar to ""3 Idiots"": entertaining and hilarious but with not very memorable characters like in ""3 Idiots,"" except ""Pk"" himself.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",pk hilarious entertaining movie,pk was one most anticipated movies year may be aamir khan raj kumar hirani or promising promos film film tries see world through eyes alien who has no idea what life earth is like through this character film tries make satire different religions stubbornness religions god men managers god as described movie aspect subject doesnt come strongly than paresh rawals omg oh my god which debate existence god religions was stronger interesting anyway questions put first half representation different religions are pretty witty hold audiences edge their seats however film doesnt stick single issue delves much into melodrama which makes it light entertaining movie than strong social issue based movie whole film appears amalgam many popular movies like 3 idiots lage raho munna bhai or omg however alien as protagonist way he deals asks simple questions basic truths life make this film entertaining novel overall aamir khan steals show anushka sharma saurabh sukla parikshit sahni also deliver good performances direction raj kumar hirani is similar 3 idiots entertaining hilarious but with not very memorable characters like 3 idiots except pk himself rating 2 5 stars out 4,0.5623673335211796,0.12058795904949751,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,The best Indian satire movie till date,"Till yesterday, the benchmark for the best Hindi movie was 3 Idiots. But after watching PK, I would say that the benchmark should be changed. The same team that brought 3 Idiots has brought another magnificent movie. Everyone in the movie acted exceptionally well. The manner in which the social issues are depicted is very good. If we see the comedy aspects alone, 3 idiots is better. But if we see the social issues taken, PK is far better than the other movie. This is Aamir's best performance till date. Ranbir Kapoor comes in a comical guest role. Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput and Saurabh Shukla are the other main characters.Overall rating- 9.5/10",best indian satire movie till date,till yesterday benchmark best hindi movie was 3 idiots but after watching pk i would say that benchmark should be changed same team that brought 3 idiots has brought another magnificent movie everyone movie acted exceptionally well manner which social issues are depicted is very good if we see comedy aspects alone 3 idiots is better but if we see social issues taken pk is far better than other movie this is aamirs best performance till date ranbir kapoor comes comical guest role anushka sharma sushant singh rajput saurabh shukla are other main characters overall rating 9 5 10,0.5210833333333335,0.23800000000000004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.3}"

8.0,A great social comedy movie,"First half of the movie focuses on comedic aspect. I think the last time I heard such hearty laughs were at 3 idiots screening. Amir Khan's acting is brilliant as always. Whoever wrote this story had given it much thought on the basic idea as it was thought provoking and tries to shatter the root of evil in our religious society. But the upper layers of the story were like any other Indian movie, with same emotional drama in awkward places, a love story, an evil guy who gets ridiculed, etc. Thus the movie couldn't get too deep. It couldn't deliver to its full potential, but at any moment in the story I didn't feel bored. Songs are right on spot and creates a good mood. The movie also makes you realize how colorful, beautiful yet complex Indian society is. If you liked the movie Oh my god! then I am sure you would like this too.

8.0,PK Makes The Important Points In Right Manner,"'PK' is latest offering from blockbuster duo of Aamir Khan and Rahkumar Hirani. They deliver first 200 cr film '3 Idiots' and this time expectations are for 300 cr. Let's see whether they manage to achieve that. Film has rather interetsing plot. Alien PK (Aamir Khan) lands in Rajasthan and he lost his connection with spaceship and so he tries to survive on earth on his own. But his mannerism and thirst for knowledge of this new planet result in questioning of basic premises of religions. Though this sounds similar to 'Oh My God!' but that was more entertaining and here the treatment is more serious. In middle of this journey he meets good friend Bhairao Singh (Sanjay Dutt), Jaggu (Anushka Sharma). Jaggu is a student from Belgium but her role is half baked though that looks deliberate. In the end how PK manages touch upon some relevant issues and leaves a mark form the climax of the film. Performance wise Aamir Khan is simply outstanding and his methodical acting in every frame is commendable. He never goes out of character and his emotional impact is superb in climax. Anushka Sharma again gets 'Jab Tak Hai Jaan' kind of character which is catalyst but not a typical actress role. She manages to make a mark despite half baked role and presence of Aamir. Sushant Singh Rajput looks like a star and even in brief role he is too good. Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla get very little to do and Sanjay Dutt is decent.Film has some real boring songs and all songs work as welcome break in the film. Editing is uneven and cinematography is decent. Background score is good. Story and screenplay are so tight that they manage to hold the film together throughout despite flaws. Dialogues are strictly average and at times Bhojpuri dialect looks out of the place. Art department and costume department are below par. Director Rajkumar Hirani again makes an entertaining social film where he raises few important points in right manner but this time impact is no where clsoe to his best work 'Lage Raho Munnabhai'. Film tries hard but then that should not be visible. Because it is releasing after 'Oh My God', the novelty goes away to some extent.

10.0,Message Received.,"Had a bulk of Expectations from PK while I was walking into the Cinema hall. This film created buzz ever since the 1st Poster was released. All the promos were intriguing & made me watch the film. And as usual Rajkumar Hirani & Aamir Khan didn't disappoint me. Rather i got more than what i expected. Started off with a Simple Love story between Anushka & Sushant Singh Rajput which could look a li'l dull at times. But it picked up nicely ever since Aamir Khan got into the frame. There are Laughter riots throughout the 1st half. The song 'Bhagwan..' was Picturised amazingly. The song sang by Sonu Nigam left me with moist eyes. But the main focus of the film was to put light on our way of thinking about the Godmen. 'PK' takes this message a few steps higher than what we saw in Paresh Rawal starrer 'Oh My God'. It also brightened the focus on people's point-of-view towards different Religions. The 1st half was full of pace and some memorable scenes. 2nd half started off a little slowly with a couple of stretched scenes (that had no need of). But it again picked up pace and headed towards the Climax with lots more drama, laughter and excitement. For me, it's one of the Best executed films i have seen recently. One of the Best fims of 2014 for sure (along with the likes of 'Haider' & 'Queen') if not the Best. It's also a very timely released film as the devastating terror attack took place in Pakistan a few days back. Talking about the acting, Aamir Khan has just Killed it once again. I can't recall when is the last time I came across such a brilliant performance in bollywood. His Acting, his expressions, his style - everything was just beautiful. Arguably his Best Ever Performance. Anushka Sharma, playing a TV Journalist has also done a commendable job. Sourabh Shukla looked extra- ordinary in his Bald look. he was awesome as usual. Sunshat & Boman were good in their respective small roles. PK is a Trademark Rajkumar Hirani Film written all over it with Laughter, Emotions, Drama & an important Message. I would Love if the whole Bollywood starts making films like Raju Hirani without caring about Box Office Records as Baba Ranchoddas says, ""Chase Excellence, success will follow you"" ;) & lastly, if you are a Bollywood lover, then you'll have a huge Surprise at the End of the Film. :)",message received,had bulk expectations pk while i was walking into cinema hall this film created buzz ever since 1st poster was released all promos were intriguing made me watch film as usual rajkumar hirani aamir khan didnt disappoint me rather i got more than what i expected started off with simple love story between anushka sushant singh rajput which could look lil dull at times but it picked up nicely ever since aamir khan got into frame there are laughter riots throughout 1st half song bhagwan was picturised amazingly song sang by sonu nigam left me with moist eyes but main focus film was put light our way thinking about godmen pk takes this message few steps higher than what we saw paresh rawal starrer oh my god it also brightened focus peoples point view towards different religions 1st half was full pace some memorable scenes 2nd half started off little slowly with couple stretched scenes that had no need but it again picked up pace headed towards climax with lots more drama laughter excitement me its one best executed films i have seen recently one best fims 2014 sure along with likes haider queen if not best its also very timely released film as devastating terror attack took place pakistan few days back talking about acting aamir khan has just killed it once again i cant recall when is last time i came across such brilliant performance bollywood his acting his expressions his style everything was just beautiful arguably his best ever performance anushka sharma playing tv journalist has also done commendable job sourabh shukla looked extra ordinary his bald look he was awesome as usual sunshat boman were good their respective small roles pk is trademark rajkumar hirani film written all over it with laughter emotions drama important message i would love if whole bollywood starts making films like raju hirani without caring about box office records as baba ranchoddas says chase excellence success will follow you lastly if you are bollywood lover then youll have huge surprise at end film,0.41477633477633485,0.16522727272727272,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.25}"
7.0,This film is definitely not a wrong number!!! Aamir lived the role of PK,"An intriguing tale, the story begins with PK (aamir) who happens to be an alien that comes to earth to study the human beings and lifestyle. But after reaching, he loses his tracker device through which he has to communicate to his spaceship. Not knowing the language, the people, PK has a tough time but he eventually finds a good friend in the form of Bhairav Singh (sanjay dutt). Few incidents occur and PK finds himself in Delhi in his search for tracker device. He is helped by Jagat Janani (anushka) in his search. What happens after that forms the rest.The director has come up with a unusual storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was quite absorbing. The dialogues were well written. The script was above average and the screenplay made it lot better. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was crisp. Costumes were well designed to suit the backdrop while the art department was majestic. Aamir Khan has given a stellar performance and he stole the show, easily one of his career bests. Anushka Sharma was competent and did her best. Sanjay Dutt was superb. Saurabh Shukla and Boman Irani were not used to their fullest. Sushant Singh was effective. Others did their bit as required and added value.The basic crux of the plot is quite interesting and it was a take on few beliefs of our society that have existed since centuries. While it has been blended with some satire, some humor and some emotion, there was some slack in energy. The first half goes about with elements of comedy, some interesting moments and the interval bang was interesting. The second half slows down a bit and takes the fizz away but it has its own share of bright moments, but predictability seeps in . Overall, this film seems to have an Oh My God, hangover as its story is quite similar. This is probably one of RKH weakest films, but thats saying a lot because the film is still great. Expectations where high and the films 1st half meet those expectations the film seemed humorous and pathbreaking, but the 2nd half syndrome does sep in. But still this film is a must watch for the films overall, message against how religious and some society norms are ridiculous, and for aamir's performance.3.5/5* or 7/10",this film is definitely not wrong number aamir lived role pk,intriguing tale story begins with pk aamir who happens be alien that comes earth study human beings lifestyle but after reaching he loses his tracker device through which he has communicate his spaceship not knowing language people pk has tough time but he eventually finds good friend form bhairav singh sanjay dutt few incidents occur pk finds himself delhi his search tracker device he is helped by jagat janani anushka his search what happens after that forms rest director has come up with unusual storyline while presentation was rich narrative was quite absorbing dialogues were well written script was above average screenplay made it lot better background score was melodious three songs were worth watching cinematography was main strength this film editing was crisp costumes were well designed suit backdrop while art department was majestic aamir khan has given stellar performance he stole show easily one his career bests anushka sharma was competent did her best sanjay dutt was superb saurabh shukla boman irani were not used their fullest sushant singh was effective others did their bit as required added value basic crux plot is quite interesting it was take few beliefs our society that have existed since centuries while it has been blended with some satire some humor some emotion there was some slack energy first half goes about with elements comedy some interesting moments interval bang was interesting second half slows down bit takes fizz away but it has its own share bright moments but predictability seeps overall this film seems have oh my god hangover as its story is quite similar this is probably one rkh weakest films but thats saying lot because film is still great expectations where high films 1st half meet those expectations film seemed humorous pathbreaking but 2nd half syndrome does sep but still this film is must watch films overall message against how religious some society norms are ridiculous aamirs performance 3 5 5 or 7 10,0.45515700483091787,0.19327294685990334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8.0,An innocent comedy movie that not just makes you laugh your hearts out but makes you think as the movie proceeds. Brilliant work done by Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan.,"2 things: Aamir Khan, Rajkumar Hirani. Actually, one needs nothing more than this to go and watch the movie. Two of the finest people in their craft when join hands, you can expect nothing short of a BLOCKBUSTER, in every sense of the word. Saw this movie first day, first show and might I add the occupancy of the theater was about 60% for a 10:00 am show. That speaks for itself about the enthusiasm that people had about the movie. The year 2014 has surely ended with a SMASH HIT. I was disappointed with Aamir after Dhoom 3 and I guess I am not alone but this movie makes up for everything, every darn thing. It is not Aamir's best performance but would surely count as one of his best. What makes it so bloody brilliant is the story which takes some pretty serious subject matters and portrays them to the audience in a way that the audience can only laugh, and when in the serious scenes, they do not laugh, what they do is reflect over what happened and THINK and the obvious BRILLIANT direction by Rajkumar Hirani. This movie makes you THINK. PK caters to both the types of audiences, one who just want uninhibited CRAZINESS and just want to ENJOY their time while they watch a movie, and the other, who want the movie to make sense and make you think, they want to learn something from it. THIS MOVIE CATERS TO BOTH!! Sushant Singh Rajput was used adequately in the movie, some might feel his role was small but I don't think so. Sanjay Dutt does justice to his role too. Boman Irani had a small role, smaller than that of Sanjay Dutt's. Anushka Sharma was pretty okay. Nothing great or spectacular. Oh and, watch out for that SURPRISE at the end of the movie!! PLEASE GO AND WATCH, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!",innocent comedy movie that not just makes you laugh your hearts out but makes you think as movie proceeds brilliant work done by rajkumar hirani aamir khan,2 things aamir khan rajkumar hirani actually one needs nothing more than this go watch movie two finest people their craft when join hands you can expect nothing short blockbuster every sense word saw this movie first day first show might i add occupancy theater was about 60 10 00 am show that speaks itself about enthusiasm that people had about movie year 2014 has surely ended with smash hit i was disappointed with aamir after dhoom 3 i guess i am not alone but this movie makes up everything every darn thing it is not aamirs best performance but would surely count as one his best what makes it so bloody brilliant is story which takes some pretty serious subject matters portrays them audience way that audience can only laugh when serious scenes they do not laugh what they do is reflect over what happened think obvious brilliant direction by rajkumar hirani this movie makes you think pk caters both types audiences one who just want uninhibited craziness just want enjoy their time while they watch movie other who want movie make sense make you think they want learn something it this movie caters both sushant singh rajput was used adequately movie some might feel his role was small but i dont think so sanjay dutt does justice his role too boman irani had small role smaller than that sanjay dutts anushka sharma was pretty okay nothing great or spectacular oh watch out that surprise at end movie please go watch you will not be disappointed,0.5762698412698413,0.20071428571428573,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.16}"
9.0,A Delight! Rajkumar Hirani is a Genius!,"Rajkumar Hirani proved his mettle with the Munnabhai series & the astounding 3 Idiots, and with 'P.K', his latest outing, the supremely talented filmmaker proves that he's indeed a Genius! A film that is funny, at times hilarious, but lastly, is a film about finding truth within ourselves. Its a powerful film, that left me astonished!'P.K' Synopsis: An alien stuck on earth, gets help from a budding TV-anchor, and later learns about Religion & a fear named God.'P.K' raises questions upon God, God-Men & Religion. I'm an atheist & I could connect with the protagonist's fight against the ""almighty"" to a great extent. The film has moral as well as a terrific message, that will leave this godly world we live in, rather stunned. Hirani's story offers moments of pure hilarity, subtle romance, tuneful songs & hard-hitting drama.Hirani's Screenplay is excellent. P.K's journey on earth, will leave you in splits. His voice against the God-Men, are clap-worthy, while his Romance with his human girlfriend, is cute. What's truly funny, is that, P.K, an alien, looks far more sorted & normal in comparison to the human characters. And that's Hirani's genius! He delivers a story about our fears & flaws & he executes it, remarkably well.Hirani's Direction is simple, yet effective. Cinematography & Editing are perfect. Music by Various Artists is tuneful. Visual Effects are decent. Make-Up is nicely done. Performance-Wise: Aamir's portrayal of 'P.K', is simply astounding! He delivers a moving, heartfelt performance, that touches the core of your heart. He carries the film on his board shoulders & steals the show. His finest performance to date! Anushka Sharma is lovely. Also, Her on-screen chemistry with Aamir, is adorable. Sanjay Dutt is lovable in a cameo. Sushant Singh Rajput, also, shines in a brief role. Saurabh Shukla is incredible as the God-Man. His scenes with Aamir, are captivating. Boman Irani is first-rate, as always. Parikshet Sahani is wonderful. Ranbir Kapoor makes an amazing appearance.

8.0,"Wrong Number, Right Film","The alien PK (Aamir Khan) arrives on a desert in India and leaves his spacecraft naked with a necklace with a remote control to contact the ship. However he is stolen by a drifter that flees in a train. Meanwhile in Burges, Belgium, the Indian student of television production Jagat ""Jaggu"" Janani (Anushka Sharma) meets the Pakistani student Sarfraz Yousuf (Sushant Singh Rajput) and they immediately fall in love with each other. When Jaggu tells her family about Sarfraz, her father consults his guru Tapasvi Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla) that tells that Sarfraz will leave her. Jaggu and Sarfraz decide to get married but while waiting for him in the temple, a boy delivers a letter to her telling that he will not marry her due to their different religions. Jaggu returns to India and works in a television network. When Jaggu meets the naive PK, he tells his journey to her and his search for God to retrieve his remote control but she does not believe in his words. But soon she realizes that he is an alien and is telling the truth. When PK discovers that Tapasvi has his remote control and claims that it belonged to God, PK tells that he is dialing the wrong number to God and giving wrong advices to his followers. Jaggu decides to use PK in a show to expose the guru and retrieve his remote control. But PK falls in unrequited love with her. What will happen to PK and Jaggu? ""PK"" is another great Indian film, with a funny and touching story of innocence, friendship and love. PK asks innocent questions that disarm his opponents and make them think. Further, is a powerful criticism to charlatans and false religious leaders that manipulate their followers to take their money.

The moment I saw the plot becoming real within the first 10 minutes, I was skeptical whether I will like this movie. But to my surprise Aamir Khan blew me away with his incomparable acting skills and cuteness of the character. He will make you feel as if you are looking at a child who has been introduced in the world for the first time but has a consciousnesses.

1.0,OMG was a lot powerful than this one!,"""Secularism doesn't mean abuse the majority!"" Someone aptly tweeted this few days back! The movie is good but it's few scenes that really stand out as offensive. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, you went too far this time. What you find comic, may not strike cord with everyone! You made a person playing Shiva (stage play), to run like a coward. Do you have guts to do the same to someone playing Prophet Mohammad or Jesus Christ made to run in same way and show cowardice! No! Because you'll be called nonsecular! The comparison between OMG and PK was inevitable as both movies tread the same path.However, OMG was a lot better than this one. I have watched OMG multiple times, and each time it got better. With PK, I can only say that it's one good time watch.Some people are saying that PK is Aamir's best performance! I seriously doubt that. Lagaan and 3 Idiots are miles ahead in terms of his performance.The movie boasts of some really good scenes. And yes, I enjoyed it in parts. But it failed to make the same impact that OMG did with me.Just because Hindus are tolerant and accept criticism, not every other movie should bash it. I mean, cmon. Had it been any other religion, you wouldn't have lived to see the light of another day.
