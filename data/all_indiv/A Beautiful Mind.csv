9.0,"Powerful, quiet, effortless Crowe","A Beautiful Mind Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says ""Russell Crowe"", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a ""hunk"" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",powerful quiet effortless crowe,beautiful mind director ron howard has experience playing with his audiences heartstrings remember apollo 13 when fate astronauts was uncertain ok so if you remember your recent history you knew but still or remember parenthood when steve martins kid was about make crucial catch ol opie can still pluck those strings with best them you know hell never stop being called opie even by those us who never saw andy griffith show during its initial run plucking heartstrings is not bad thing at all not when you can do it such sincere noncloying way as masterful beautiful mind presents its viewers john nash is mathematics prodigy who has decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems hes socially dysfunctional rarely looking anyone eye but pours all his energy soul into producing one original idea idea that will distinguish him all other mathemathical minds at princeton university but john like most who have had movies made about them had his ups downs he meets falls beautiful student his named alicia jennifer connelly they produce baby but john also suffers tremendous delusions is diagnosed with form schizophrenia schizophrenias tough disease folks its still not fully understood nash was diagnosed with it middle last century he spends time sanitarium as doctors struggle find cure russell crowe is absolutely powerful as confused confusing nash although marquee says russell crowe youll immediately forget this is hunky guy gladiator i mean after all hes playing some nerdy scientist dude but crowe completely disappears role hes unforgettable actors kill roles like this one because it gives them chance show off their acting chops many actors this is kiss death because then theyre exposed as poor thespians but not crowe if anything this proves once all that hes grand master acting i realize that sounds like overkill him but i think that when actors are labeled as hunk their skills as actors arent seen as very substantial hey looking darn good worked against tom selleck degree it has worked against crowe as well he ages well too movie takes place over fairly extended period time ending with nashs acceptance nobel prize 1994 makeup nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy he looks completely genuine thats essence crowes performance its sincere never trying win over audience with sly wink here or toss hair there crowe shows remarkable poise elegance is utterly astounding role his supporting cast is more than able jennifer connelly is better than i thought she would be most roles shes eye candy but this role had meat it she held her own it wasnt easy role play she pulled it off her scenes with crowe do have that movie magic that each us looks when we go movies that one moment that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized yes this does have some very very touching moments final scene while predictable even if you dont know outcome real life will bring more than one tear eye yes ill admit it it got me right here but its okay i did that old guy crying movie theater trick if you feel brime falling lid you make motion toward your cheek then you scratch vigorously people might think you have skin infection move away slowly but at least they wont think youre girly man at any rate its certainly one best movies year everythings place direction photography especially acting,0.5634016106442575,0.2637050653594771,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,A Beautiful Movie,"I think its a good idea to know as little as possible about this movie before seeing it. Now that I've seen it, the commercials on television seem to be giving away too much. With that in mind DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!Its a hard movie to pinpoint. Its not like any other movie I've ever seen, in that a character exists that is not real. John Nash's mind is the reality of the movie and its not until the movie is half over that you realize this and its jarring that you've been taken on a ride with this man's illness, and accepted it as the real world. Its also a very heartbreaking thing.From the middle point, John and you see the world differently because he starts to receive treatment.Russell Crowe does not overdo it for a minute and turns in his customary brilliant performance. Would not surprise me at all if he were to win his second Best Actor Oscar in March 2002. He really is that good.Just as good but with less screen time is the beautiful and beautifully talent Jennifer Connelly, who the world may finally get to see in a mainstream movie. Her chemistry with Crowe is vital to the movie and neither of them disappoint the audience at all in that respect.I enjoyed it immensely and felt like I had seen a movie when it was over. I was shown a person at their best and the worse and everything in between, by a masterful actor at the top of his game.I am sure Ron Howard deserves a lot of credit that he won't get, too.",beautiful movie,i think its good idea know as little as possible about this movie before seeing it now that ive seen it commercials television seem be giving away too much with that mind do not read this if you havent seen it its hard movie pinpoint its not like any other movie ive ever seen that character exists that is not real john nashs mind is reality movie its not until movie is half over that you realize this its jarring that youve been taken ride with this mans illness accepted it as real world its also very heartbreaking thing middle point john you see world differently because he starts receive treatment russell crowe does not overdo it minute turns his customary brilliant performance would not surprise me at all if he were win his second best actor oscar march 2002 he really is that good just as good but with less screen time is beautiful beautifully talent jennifer connelly who world may finally get see mainstream movie her chemistry with crowe is vital movie neither them disappoint audience at all that respect i enjoyed it immensely felt like i had seen movie when it was over i was shown person at their best worse everything between by masterful actor at top his game i am sure ron howard deserves lot credit that he wont get too,0.5405723905723905,0.3003787878787878,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.19}"
9.0,Crowe Does It Again!,"The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show ""Monk"" has become.Crowe's character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as ""Monk,"" but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. (One example: in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn't have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005's ""Cinderella Man.""For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning.",crowe does it again,more i watch russell crowe more i am becoming big fan his acting talent here again he demonstrates his skills role that had me spellbound course mentally ill people are usually fascinating look how popular cable television show monk has become crowes character mathematician john nash is not nearly as eccentric as monk but his schizophrenia makes fascinating portrait very troubled man this is another those ron howard based true story films so dont take everything here as gospel truth because it aint so one example real life nashs wife was anything but as supportive as jennifer connelly was portrayed here first time i saw this film i was disappointed maybe i expected more maybe i felt story was unfair viewer i felt like this was just one more attempt at liberal hollywood make fun those 1950s who were opposed communism well second viewing just few weeks ago i didnt have problem with any those things just enjoying performances classy looking cinematography thanks one best cameramen business roger deakins im not always fan director ron howard but his films are usually interesting pleasing eye he crowe seem be good pair too as witnessed by 2005s cinderella man those who enjoy cerebral thriller this is very intriguing film ed harris paul bettany adam goldberg judd hirsch josh lucas anthony rapp all deliver solid supporting help if you havent seen this this story will deliver big surprise if you know ending second viewing is even more interesting as you trace nashs actions beginning,0.4960360360360361,0.22675675675675677,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9.0,A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Lose.,"The story of John Forbes Nash doesn't seem like the subject matter anyone would want to make a film of, but Ron Howard brings forth his life-story in a way that makes one forget he was also the man behind 80s fluff such as SPLASH and WILLOW.A life destined to excel once he discovers and cracks his ""game theory,"" John Forbes Nash is, however, a man disconnected with his surroundings and reality. He can't even approach a girl without fumbling his way through an especially creepy introduction, and at the same time he can't stand losing a simple mind-game with his friend. At the same time, four other people make their appearances in Nash's life and all three are destined to change his life forever.The first of them is a college friend Charlie (Paul Bettany of GANGSTER NO. 1) who later introduces Nash to his young daughter Marcee, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), whom he marries, and a sinister figure: William Parcher (Ed Harris). Parcher has special designs for Nash: he wants him to use his keen code-cracking skills for special top-secret assignments involving the Russians and other obscure elements and on one night Nash gets to see just how dangerous the enemy is as he and Parcher are shot at after Nash delivers some information to a strange mansion posing as an intelligence office.It's not long before Nash becomes consumed with finding the perfect code and aided by the omni-present Parcher, who supplies Nash with a security code embedded into his own skin, he dives headlong into a nightmare of numbers and codes and soon enough collapses into full-fledged schizophrenia which will require shock treatment and an arduous recovery period. Alicia, instead of moving on, forcefully stays by his side even when he has a dangerous regression and almost kills their baby child.Stories like this require a tight script and thorough knowledge of the circumstance of mental illness as well as the person in question, in this case Nash. Howard directs Nash's progressive descent into his mental breakdown with ease and in a way where we're not sure if anyone who surrounded Nash is real -- the way he introduces Charlie, Marcee, and especially Parcher and the covert office is spectacular and shows just how strong schizophrenia can be in inducing its victims to completely believe what they are seeing and hearing.And then there are the performances. I don't think I need to say anything which hasn't been said of Russell Crowe. He is, right now, the only living actor who has the guts and balls to put his masculinity aside and dive head-first into the roles he plays. His screen presence oozes a magnetic, masculine power (and in one scene it's clear the man is built) but that doesn't overcome his characterization of Nash. If anything, he uses his physicality as an asset to clumsily walk around, and there is one scene later in the movie when he has returned to teach classes. He walks with the shuffle of someone who's lost in his own world. It would be hard-pressed for anyone to see the staccato waddle and the glazed eyes that he wouldn't be talking to himself in full-fledged conversations, and the hippie who mocks him, unnoticed, expresses Anyone's reaction. We know this is a genius, but one who has become damaged goods.Then there's Jennifer Connelly. An actress who as of yet has avoided selling out to blatant commercialism, her presence is as powerful as Crowe's. Quiet but intense, she is the foundation of which Crowe's feet rest on and without her he might as well be dead. Just one scene, when she is about to discover just how crazy her husband is and his colleagues are trying to stop her: just watch her reel around and casually but with authority slap one of them squarely in the face and continue on, undeterred. Marvelous acting. Her Oscar is justified.The entire supporting cast is uniformly brilliant. Ed Harris nails his creepy role as the imaginary Parcher. Paul Bettany gives off friendly dependency -- the friend who won't go away, even though he, too, isn't real. Judd Hirsch, Adam Goldberg, and Christopher Plummer provide solid support in small roles.A complex movie about mental illness as well as the power of love and the triumph of the soul (even if love -- the devotion between Alicia and John -- is excruciatingly strained at times), A BEAUTIFUL MIND is truly, a beautiful experience and justly won the Oscar for Best Movie and Director and should have also won Best Actor, but Russell Crowe will stick around for quite some time giving powerhouse performances. He is one strong actor to follow. I know I will.",mind is terrible thing lose,story john forbes nash doesnt seem like subject matter anyone would want make film but ron howard brings forth his life story way that makes one forget he was also man behind 80s fluff such as splash willow life destined excel once he discovers cracks his game theory john forbes nash is however man disconnected with his surroundings reality he cant even approach girl without fumbling his way through especially creepy introduction at same time he cant stand losing simple mind game with his friend at same time four other people make their appearances nashs life all three are destined change his life forever first them is college friend charlie paul bettany gangster no 1 who later introduces nash his young daughter marcee alicia jennifer connelly whom he marries sinister figure william parcher ed harris parcher has special designs nash he wants him use his keen code cracking skills special top secret assignments involving russians other obscure elements one night nash gets see just how dangerous enemy is as he parcher are shot at after nash delivers some information strange mansion posing as intelligence office its not long before nash becomes consumed with finding perfect code aided by omni present parcher who supplies nash with security code embedded into his own skin he dives headlong into nightmare numbers codes soon enough collapses into full fledged schizophrenia which will require shock treatment arduous recovery period alicia instead moving forcefully stays by his side even when he has dangerous regression almost kills their baby child stories like this require tight script thorough knowledge circumstance mental illness as well as person question this case nash howard directs nashs progressive descent into his mental breakdown with ease way where were not sure if anyone who surrounded nash is real way he introduces charlie marcee especially parcher covert office is spectacular shows just how strong schizophrenia can be inducing its victims completely believe what they are seeing hearing then there are performances i dont think i need say anything which hasnt been said russell crowe he is right now only living actor who has guts balls put his masculinity aside dive head first into roles he plays his screen presence oozes magnetic masculine power one scene its clear man is built but that doesnt overcome his characterization nash if anything he uses his physicality as asset clumsily walk around there is one scene later movie when he has returned teach classes he walks with shuffle someone whos lost his own world it would be hard pressed anyone see staccato waddle glazed eyes that he wouldnt be talking himself full fledged conversations hippie who mocks him unnoticed expresses anyones reaction we know this is genius but one who has become damaged goods then theres jennifer connelly actress who as yet has avoided selling out blatant commercialism her presence is as powerful as crowes quiet but intense she is foundation which crowes feet rest without her he might as well be dead just one scene when she is about discover just how crazy her husband is his colleagues are trying stop her just watch her reel around casually but with authority slap one them squarely face continue undeterred marvelous acting her oscar is justified entire supporting cast is uniformly brilliant ed harris nails his creepy role as imaginary parcher paul bettany gives off friendly dependency friend who wont go away even though he too isnt real judd hirsch adam goldberg christopher plummer provide solid support small roles complex movie about mental illness as well as power love triumph soul even if love devotion between alicia john is excruciatingly strained at times beautiful mind is truly beautiful experience justly won oscar best movie director should have also won best actor but russell crowe will stick around quite some time giving powerhouse performances he is one strong actor follow i know i will,0.5326461478900502,0.05524099883855983,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,A Beautiful Film,"It's not that common people knew John Forbes Nash jr., a Princeton mathematician after he recieved Nobel Prize for his ""Game Theory"". It's not that people started to know him after Sylvia Nasar wrote his biography. What made John Nash a household name is Ron Howard's brilliant direction and Russell Crowe's excellent performance as the scizophrenic genious.Russell Crowe exceeds all of his past performances in this film. He did not act as Nash, he became Nash. His facial expression while solving a problem, his innocent and shy smile during romantic sequences and his vacant look during the time of scizophrenia are in a word magnificient, and shockingly original. Jennifer Connelly also put a beautiful performance as his devoted wife Alicia. The actings of these two are the core of success of this film. I am still in a dark why Crowe is denied his Oscar for the best actor. Ron Howard changed the original story in some places a bit, but only to make it more enjoyable. His main goal was to feature Nash's point of view to his world and he has succeeded totally. The shot in the cafe` where Nash first understands the significance of the application of his theory is brilliantly taken and is the best example of Howard's genious as a filmmaker. The make-up throughout the film is drop-dead gorgeous as they showed Nash and Alicia aging in the course of the film. Thus the Russell Crowe in the beginning and the Russell Crowe in the end become two different entities due to the superb art of the make-up artists.A Beautiful Mind will be considered one of the best biopics ever. It is dramatic, descriptive, detailed, reflective, enthusiastic, heroic and in all, a beautiful film. 10/10.",beautiful film,its not that common people knew john forbes nash jr princeton mathematician after he recieved nobel prize his game theory its not that people started know him after sylvia nasar wrote his biography what made john nash household name is ron howards brilliant direction russell crowes excellent performance as scizophrenic genious russell crowe exceeds all his past performances this film he did not act as nash he became nash his facial expression while solving problem his innocent shy smile during romantic sequences his vacant look during time scizophrenia are word magnificient shockingly original jennifer connelly also put beautiful performance as his devoted wife alicia actings these two are core success this film i am still dark why crowe is denied his oscar best actor ron howard changed original story some places bit but only make it more enjoyable his main goal was feature nashs point view his world he has succeeded totally shot cafe where nash first understands significance application his theory is brilliantly taken is best example howards genious as filmmaker make up throughout film is drop dead gorgeous as they showed nash alicia aging course film thus russell crowe beginning russell crowe end become two different entities due superb art make up artists beautiful mind will be considered one best biopics ever it is dramatic descriptive detailed reflective enthusiastic heroic all beautiful film 10 10,0.6132882882882883,0.3650900900900901,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,"A beautifully written, acted, and crafted movie.","A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) Rating: 10/10A Beautiful Mind's greatest achievement, in my humble opinion, is the way it makes schizophrenia accessible to ""sane"" people. The general public knows schizophrenics tend to talk to themselves, repeat certain actions and do things generally at odds with the norm. But why? It's nearly impossible for a ""sane"" individual to understand why this happens...and more importantly, what that feels like. Without this essential empathy, many people become frustrated with the mentally ill, asking why patients can't pull themselves together and just bear up. We express this same impatience with the criminally insane who act upon delusions with disastrous results. It is incomprehensible.A Beautiful Mind does all it can to change that, and it succeeds. Unless you are familiar with John Nash's story, you probably won't guess he's schizophrenic until part-way into the movie. He's eccentric, abrupt, and highly intelligent, but doesn't seem crazy. His delusions are as real as reality to Nash, and likewise, they are real to the audience, who cannot tell the difference between truth and delusion.Incidentally, I came across a review from a ""professional critic"" who blasted A Beautiful Mind for including ""all that spying stuff that had nothing to do with Nash's work that was thrown in for Hollywood thrill."" I feel bad for that chap, since he missed the entire point of the film. But that just proves Ron Howard's genius in creating a picture of insanity indistinguishable from reality.There are some truly shocking moments in A Beautiful Mind. When Alicia finds her husband's secret cache of newspaper clippings behind their house, I was eerily reminded of Jack Nicholson's wife in The Shining discovering his endless, typewritten pages of the same phrase. The scene that follows, culminating with Nash's realization that his delusions are indeed a false reality is brilliant. In a moment, remembering Marcee, Nash has a flash of insight, and he finally accepts his illness -- ironically, through his intellect. When Nash imagines that someone is going to harm Alicia, he lunges at her -- and only through his eyes do we see how a seemingly senseless act of violence is a gesture of love, filtered through the smog of delusion.Now my take on the acting: Superb in every sense of the word. Russell Crowe is incredible. I can't stress that enough. There's never any question about the authenticity of his character. Crowe doesn't rely on his elaborate makeup to age Nash -- his walk, words, and voice do that elegantly in the movie's end. Crowe will get at least another Oscar nomination out of this one. And, he better win. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as well. And when Crowe and Connelly are put together, extraordinary chemistry erupts, they just gel together, they really belong with one another. Some people have had problems with the romance part of the movie, saying that the way John and Alicia even started seeing each other wasn't very realistic and why Alicia would stay with John after he becomes distant. But, I think that maybe it started out as just a crush, you know, and the math question she showed him was just her excuse for going to his office and she already knew she was going to ask him out before hand. Maybe she's just attracted to the kind of person Nash is? Who knows? A lot of people are attracted to the ""weirdest"" things sometimes. The crush took over the fact that he sort of insulted her work and she still asked him anyway. When you're around someone you like so much you can't help but be fooled by them. I can't really explain it, but I can understand why she still asked him to dinner. And I guess if you love someone as much as Alicia loved John, then you would stick with them through anything. Even how distant he became, she still stuck with him.Moving on, I think Ed Harris is, as always, great. Harris continues to prove that, simply because he's flawless. With delusions like these, no wonder Nash was torn between treatment and ""spying.""Simply put, A Beautiful Mind is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 15 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. The characters continued to haunt me after the movie (and still do), thanks to the Oscar-inducing performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and all of the supporting players. They are not merely acting, yet are transformed into the characters, leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality.Of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow, and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about A Beautiful Mind. Ron Howard contributes truly inspiring work to this film, and I hope that the critics remember him when awards are being given out.All I can tell you now is that if you're looking for an emotionally-charged movie that will make you cry, but still filters in some very funny moments as to lighten things up every now and then, with near perfect acting, cinematography, directing, editing and a screenplay which will cause the story of John Nash to inspire you, then consider A Beautiful Mind.I hope a lot of people see this film. Not just because Russell Crowe is a hunk or because it's a Ron Howard piece, but because you will learn something important. You will learn why compassion is an absolute must when dealing with the mentally ill. You won't glare at the next person you see muttering to themselves. And when someone you love is dealing with a disorder, be it schizophrenia or depression, you won't ask them to ""pull themselves together."" You will understand why they need your love -- because they are just as confused as you are.In closing, if Russell Crowe isn't awarded the Best Actor Oscar this year, then my faith in movies and its rewards system will be seriously tarnished.",beautifully written acted crafted movie,beautiful mind 2001 rating 10 10a beautiful minds greatest achievement my humble opinion is way it makes

8.0,"John Nash, schizophrenic genius.","John Nash is something of a mathematical wizard. Constantly searching for something with which to make his name, he finds his calling by code breaking for the government. But with that comes a sense of paranoia and pretty soon John is sliding desperately into schizophrenia.There is a school of thought that says any decent film about the mentally ill or afflicted is a sure fire way to attract the awards givers. Personally it bothers me that it bothers me that people view these films in this demeaning manner. If a story is worth telling then lets get it out there for all to see. Would the cinema world and all those stuffy film lovers really be happy if film makers didn't tell these remarkable stories? A Beautiful Mind is one such picture that divides opinions, although exemplary made and well put together, it doesn't adhere quite to the facts of Nash's life-it's an interpretation that smooths out the drama by way of delivering a safe and watchable biography. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning four for Best Film, Best Director {Ron Howard}, Best Supporting Actress {Jennifer Connelly} and Best Adapted Screenplay {Akiva Goldsman adapting from the book by Sylvia Nash}. Yet as great as that roll call is, the big surprise is the omission of a win for Russell Crowe in the Best Actor category. For as tidy and engrossing as the film is, and it is folks, it's because of the big Kiwi that the film breaks free of your standard emotional heart tugger. It's a superlative performance from Crowe and him not winning is probably more to do with his much publicised dust up at the BAFTAS a few weeks before the Oscar ceremony: than his undoubted acting ability.The film as a whole should not be viewed as a representation of John Nash's life, many important things from Sylvia Nash's book have been omitted. But crucially it's important to note that in making this film, the makers have brought Nobel Prize winner Nash to the public's attention, whilst simultaneously giving awareness to the sadness of those suffering with schizophrenia. OK, so it's far from perfect in its portrayal of Nash the man, but ultimately the cinematic world is a far better place when the likes of A Beautiful Mind are being made and the film lovers are flocking to see it. And then some. 8/10",john nash schizophrenic genius,john nash is something mathematical wizard constantly searching something with which make his name he finds his calling by code breaking government but with that comes sense paranoia pretty soon john is sliding desperately into schizophrenia there is school thought that says any decent film about mentally ill or afflicted is sure fire way attract awards givers personally it bothers me that it bothers me that people view these films this demeaning manner if story is worth telling then lets get it out there all see would cinema world all those stuffy film lovers really be happy if film makers didnt tell these remarkable stories beautiful mind is one such picture that divides opinions although exemplary made well put together it doesnt adhere quite facts nashs life its interpretation that smooths out drama by way delivering safe watchable biography it was nominated eight academy awards winning four best film best director ron howard best supporting actress jennifer connelly best adapted screenplay akiva goldsman adapting book by sylvia nash yet as great as that roll call is big surprise is omission win russell crowe best actor category as tidy engrossing as film is it is folks its because big kiwi that film breaks free your standard emotional heart tugger its superlative performance crowe him not winning is probably more do with his much publicised dust up at baftas few weeks before oscar ceremony than his undoubted acting ability film as whole should not be viewed as representation john nashs life many important things sylvia nashs book have been omitted but crucially its important note that making this film makers have brought nobel prize winner nash publics attention whilst simultaneously giving awareness sadness those suffering with schizophrenia ok so its far perfect its portrayal nash man but ultimately cinematic world is far better place when likes beautiful mind are being made film lovers are flocking see it then some 8 10,0.5635933806146572,0.35673758865248223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,A crazy genius,"Ron Howard has given us a film that's so different from the formula-oriented fare we receive from Hollywood, that this film, although studio born and bred, plays very much as an independent film. The madness of John Nash is approached by the director, and the writer, Akiva Goldsman, with great honesty and restraint. The production has a look that tells us we are seeing the events in the life of this crazy mathematician as it really happened. Nothing seems to be out of place here with the right touch of atmospheric detail in showing the past, when Mr. Nash went from being an up and coming star in Princeton to his being selected for the Nobel prize in 1994, with enough time going into the schizophrenia that almost ruined his academic life, as well as his own marriage.Russell Crowe plays this tormented soul with utter understanding of the man he is portraying. At no time does he strike a false note or gets too carried away with his own acting. That shows a firm hand by Mr. Howard, whose command seems to be behind every shot of this film. Ed Harris is one of the best actors around and let no one tell you otherwise. He expresses so much with the simplest gestures any actor can make. His kind of acting is seamless from film to film. Here he gives a great and understated performance as the man in John Nash's nightmares and make-believe world.The biggest surprise though, is Jennifer Connelly. She demonstrates here as well as in previous work, mainly her previous work in Requiem of a Dream, that she is in a league of her own. She's that rare breed of actresses that go from film to film acting in roles that she disappears into without any fanfare or hype. Congratulations to Mr. Howard for this film.",crazy genius,ron howard has given us film thats so different formula oriented fare we receive hollywood that this film although studio born bred plays very much as independent film madness john nash is approached by director writer akiva goldsman with great honesty restraint production has look that tells us we are seeing events life this crazy mathematician as it really happened nothing seems be out place here with right touch atmospheric detail showing past when mr nash went being up coming star princeton his being selected nobel prize 1994 with enough time going into schizophrenia that almost ruined his academic life as well as his own marriage russell crowe plays this tormented soul with utter understanding man he is portraying at no time does he strike false note or gets too carried away with his own acting that shows firm hand by mr howard whose command seems be behind every shot this film ed harris is one best actors around let no one tell you otherwise he expresses so much with simplest gestures any actor can make his kind acting is seamless film film here he gives great understated performance as man john nashs nightmares make believe world biggest surprise though is jennifer connelly she demonstrates here as well as previous work mainly her previous work requiem dream that she is league her own shes that rare breed actresses that go film film acting roles that she disappears into without any fanfare or hype congratulations mr howard this film,0.4759126984126984,0.11563492063492063,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,Not Beautifully Mined,"Spoilers herein.So frustrating. Once again we have an inept film about mathematics. Hard to understand: film is visceral, drawing from visually-based insights as abstractions of reality. That also describes the most exciting kind of mathematics.The magic of the Lord of the Rings books wasn't in the story, but in the creation of an alternative world, complete with cosmology. The film lacks that inner reality and instead focuses on the story, basically one escape after another. But it is rousing good fun on that level. And so we have here. As with `Lord,' `Mind' knows where all the emotional strings are and pulls enough of them in the right order that we get successfully manipulated. But this film misses the opportunity of a lifetime to merge the images of math and film.There are three good opportunities here, all missed:The Nash Story Part 1: Mathematics is a matter of invention more than discovery. A clever mathematician can shape abstractions that influence all thought that follows. It is as close to God as one can get, and since most of the world is imaginary, one can argue that God will be bested at some point -- if it hasn't already occurred. There are conflicting factors involved: you need to be novel, but it must bind to some part of the world that exists. The unfamiliar made familiar; which can be done through `proofs' which is a way of presenting the new in such a way that everyone believes the world was made that way all along.Which means you have to be extraordinarily clever in approaching a problem from an odd angle and finding the linkage. Nash was the best mind of the century in this first (challenging both Einstein and Von Neumann!). That's saying a whole lot. It means you have to have an intense focus that you maintain uninterrupted for months. The very idea exhausts. Nash had this in spades, perhaps his most remarkable quality because it was something he taught himself to do. Finally, mathematics is a verbal art, constructed in narratives with colleagues, not intrinsically in funny symbols as cartoons and movies would have it.So think of this: you must talk with peers using a common vocabulary; but you must not in order to stay important and novel. You must shape the new in small terms, but have a global focus, holding mental orgasms for months. The tension between reaching far into the cosmos and keeping it in a conversation must have been immense. The book on which this film is based focuses on the social devolution of Nash, but the more interesting side is where his unanchored voyages took him. The film didn't mine this lode. In reality, Nash was not incompetent with soliciting sex: in fact he was very smooth and conducted multiple simultaneous bisexual affairs. That was part of the focused exercise to relate to the `world as-is.' Where he was incompetent was in mapping his visions to our lesser reality.The Nash Story 2: Nash's madness was almost certainly caused by his `breaking' his mind by straying too far from reality to get outside this large problem he was working. The conspiracies came not from cold war silliness but something far deeper: Phil Dick science fiction and Kabbalah. Not stupid numbers but topologies (forms). Not codes but manifold patterns in higher spaces. Literally extraterrestrial voices. By the way: Alicia was as crazy, but I suppose since she had an uninteresting mind, it is not worth watching.The most powerful scene (in the book at least) is when Nash and poet Robert Lowell were in the same `hospital.' Lowell entered Nash's room and mind daily and held forth on both for visitors. `Every word was his best friend.' Quite possibly the century's most imaginative and literate minds melded. I would have loved to have been there. (In fact I was in a thin way. I took the class Nash taught right after he was first committed -- his acolyte emulated his manner.)The Nash Story 3 is the story about the Nobel. Uncle Alfie didn't like mathematicians (read `Jews') so refused to establish a prize in math. The `economics' was an independent prize grafted onto the Nobels as an `almost' Nobel. Most scientists are uncomfortable with economics being treated like physics because it is more obviously a constructed reality. Nash's prize prompted a debate within the Nobel community that destroyed the economics prize and is eating away at whether there is anything left but math when you skim more than superficially. It is one of the most profound institutional self-examinations ever. The film didn't mine this lode either.All missed opportunities. Wouldn't you like to have been transported rather than merely made to cry?What we get instead is a powerful actor and a competent director. Crowe's trick is to project his character not only into the space around him but into the space of the following scene -- largely by physical motion, usually involving the forehead. Good. But the mannerisms are not those of a mathematician in the Wiener tradition. The accent is not accurate, just an excuse to give new rhythms to the bland lines. The effect of the madness is not true, reflecting prior movies more than reality.Howard's directing is completely without risk, art, interest. The one effect he tries is a bunch of fiddling with glass: shots through windows, often with (irrelevant) mathematical doodles. These are amateurish because the film has no inner cosmology within which one can register the metaphor. Compare this with the use of glass in `Spy Game.' MIT has a specific, abstract feel that is very easy to capture, but it somehow eluded the location scout.See it. Enjoy it. But weep for the `lesser mortals' who fabricated it and mind the opportunities they missed.",not beautifully mined,spoilers herein so frustrating once again we have inept film about mathematics hard

10.0,Simply put: Beautiful,"I wasn't actually planning on going to see ""A Beautiful Mind"" in the first place, but as it was, I was convinced by the friend that accompanied me that it was truly something to see. And now, after seeing it, I thank her for that. Instead of spending two and a half hours watching George Clooney and Matt Damon rob casinos or Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore dealing with their problems in New Foundland, I found myself pulled into another kind of story, a powerful, emotional story of how one man learned to battle his own demons and dazzle the world.""A Beautiful Mind"", based on the novel by Sylvia Nasar, is the story of John Forbes Nash Jr., the genius mathematician, whose life suddenly takes a turn for the worse when he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After fierce battles with his inner self, he overcomes this and returns to win the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his brakethrough game theory in economics that he had been working on during his years in Princeton University in the 1950s.John Nash, portrayed very well by the versatile and brilliant Russell Crowe, is a partly shy, yet ironic and sometimes even arrogant, gifted young student studying in Princeton University in the late 1940s. He dedicates his time to numbers and equations, set on to solving every problem at hand, rather than mingling with co-students on the football field or in the pub.Nash is later on introduced to Sylvia (played by the lovely Jennifer Connely), a physics student attending his classes. She helps Nash to open up and eventually discover love.Enter William Parcher (played by Ed Harris), a shadowy and mysterious agent working for the Department of Defense. Parcher, after realizing Nash's ability to see mathematical and geometrical patterns everywhere, approaches Nash with a mission that involves national security.Now, amidst his work and relationship, Nash is suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of emotions and disbeliefs as he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. And this is the part where ""A Beautiful Mind"" truly shines: in portraying the disorder from Nash's own point of view. In a powerful and emotional way, it shows the viewer how difficult an illness like this can be to not only face, but overcome, something that people today may not always realize.Before seeing this movie, I must admit that I was a bit afraid that casting such a well-known actor as Russell Crowe as the main character would ruin the image of John Nash, forcing the viewer to see Crowe, rather than Nash. This is a common problem when dealing with famous actors, but to my surprise, it didn't much bother me much. And the same goes for Ed Harris.As a movie, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is absolutely great (It is so much more, but I cannot find the words to praise it enough, so I will simply go with ""great"" =). Not only does it have a strong point and an importaint message to the viewer, but it delivers it in a touching and sensitive, partly even humourous kind of way, with the help of powerful actors, a great screenplay and even a few special effects to boost it up. So for anyone whose grown tired of the consant pointless action-movies out there, and instead want to immerse themselves into a character-driven story that might actually bring a tear to your eyes, I sincerily recommend ""A Beautiful Mind"".",simply put beautiful,i wasnt actually planning going see beautiful mind first place but as it was i was convinced by friend that accompanied me that it was truly something see now after seeing it i thank her that instead spending two half hours watching george clooney matt damon rob casinos or kevin spacey julianne moore dealing with their problems new foundland i found myself pulled into another kind story powerful emotional story how one man learned battle his own demons dazzle world beautiful mind based novel by sylvia nasar is story john forbes nash jr genius mathematician whose life suddenly takes turn worse when he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia after fierce battles with his inner self he overcomes this returns win nobel prize 1994 his brakethrough game theory economics that he had been working during his years princeton university 1950s john nash portrayed very well by versatile brilliant russell crowe is partly shy yet ironic sometimes even arrogant gifted young student studying princeton university late 1940s he dedicates his time numbers equations set solving every problem at hand rather than mingling with co students football field or pub nash is later introduced sylvia played by lovely jennifer connely physics student attending his classes she helps nash open up eventually discover love enter william parcher played by ed harris shadowy mysterious agent working department defense parcher after realizing nashs ability see mathematical geometrical patterns everywhere approaches nash with mission that involves national security now amidst his work relationship nash is suddenly thrown into whirlwind emotions disbeliefs as he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this is part where beautiful mind truly shines portraying disorder nashs own point view powerful emotional way it shows viewer how difficult illness like this can be not only face but overcome something that people today may not always realize before seeing this movie i must admit that i was bit afraid that casting such well known actor as russell crowe as main character would ruin image john nash forcing viewer see crowe rather than nash this is common problem when dealing with famous actors but my surprise it didnt much bother me much same goes ed harris as movie beautiful mind is absolutely great it is so much more but i cannot find words praise it enough so i will simply go with great not only does it have strong point importaint message viewer but it delivers it touching sensitive partly even humourous kind way with help powerful actors great screenplay even few special effects boost it up so anyone whose grown tired consant pointless action movies out there instead want immerse themselves into character driven story that might actually bring tear your eyes i sincerily recommend beautiful mind,0.6249780167748918,0.21448187229437235,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8.0,Beautifully done,"Now this is the Russell Crowe I know and love. The Insider, L.A. Confidential... and now chalk up another calculating masterful performance.A Beautiful Mind tells the autobiographical story of John Forbes Nash Jr. a distinguished professor from Princeton who went on to make some great theories and win the nobel prize. The centerpiece of the story is the fact that John Nash suffers from schizophrenia a debilitating condition for most people which leaves them helpless. Thus it is amazing that Nash has been able to achieve what he has. For the most part of the story his hallucinations turn out to institutionalize him at one point, when he thinks the Russians are trying to secretly send him coded messages through news publications.First off the main performance by Crowe as Nash is amazing. This is the performance that I know he is capable of, complicated, passionate and serious, none of this gutteral one line BS that he uttered in Gladiator. Here we have a marvelous performance that Crowe spins as we watch Nash fall into despair, every twitch, eyes darting, and Nash's helplessness this is not an easy task for any actor. Nash is a recluse, almost an autistic savant, we see how he trys out his theories by writing on glass windows and stuffing himself in a corner of the library. He is seriously gifted, but a social misfit. Early on we hear how Nash describes how a grade school teacher mentioned that he was born with 2 heapings of brain but only 1/2 of heart.Ron Howard's direction is great in exposing Nash's life. Probably the best scenes involve the use of how Nash comes up with his theories such as why the dynamics of a colleagues tie is so bad, or how a plan to get all of his college buddies laid leads to a theory that makes him famous.Also what else can I say about Jeniffer Connely who plays his wife in the film. She is passionate and gives a full perfect 10 performance as well as the wife who is trying to survive with a husband she can't help. But the greatest achievement of this film is how it portrays mental illness from the perspective of the person suffering it.Most films that deal with someone with a mental condition always place the focus on the people who are outside the person suffering, watching from a distance, trying to understand. Here we have a film that literaly puts us in the mind of the sufferer, as to what it is to live with such a debilitating illness. We get Nash's sense of accomplishment, but also his demons and paranoia. And probably the most important thing is that we understand that mental illness isn't something that gets cured, the people have to live with it, and it never goes away.Also Crowe and Connely age in this film wonderfuly, so many films try to age actors/actresses in makeup and it doesn't work, but here it is done flawlessly..Minor faults in the film deal with that some of the supporting characters are reduced to props and people we don't know, and at one point the film bogs slightly when Nash is trying to return to Princeton to study. But these points are minor since the performances of the main characters are so well done, and the stories focus is on them to begin with.Crowe will probably get the best actor for this. Great film.Rating 8 out of 10.",beautifully done,now this is russell crowe i know love insider l confidential now chalk up another calculating masterful performance beautiful mind tells autobiographical story john forbes nash jr distinguished professor princeton who went make some great theories win nobel prize centerpiece story is fact that john nash suffers schizophrenia debilitating condition most people which leaves them helpless thus it is amazing that nash has been able achieve what he has most part story his hallucinations turn out institutionalize him at one point when he thinks russians are trying secretly send him coded messages through news publications first off main performance by crowe as nash is amazing this is performance that i know he is capable complicated passionate serious none this gutteral one line bs that he uttered gladiator here we have marvelous performance that crowe spins as we watch nash fall into despair every twitch eyes darting nashs helplessness this is not easy task any actor nash is recluse almost autistic savant we see how he trys out his theories by writing glass windows stuffing himself corner library he is seriously gifted but social misfit early we hear how nash describes how grade school teacher mentioned that he was born with 2 heapings brain but only 1 2 heart ron howards direction is great exposing nashs life probably best scenes involve use how nash comes up with his theories such as why dynamics colleagues tie is so bad or how plan get all his college buddies laid leads theory that makes him famous also what else can i say about jeniffer connely who plays his wife film she is passionate gives full perfect 10 performance as well as wife who is trying survive with husband she cant help but greatest achievement this film is how it portrays mental illness perspective person suffering it most films that deal with someone with mental condition always place focus people who are outside person suffering watching distance trying understand here we have film that literaly puts us mind sufferer as what it is live with such debilitating illness we get nashs sense accomplishment but also his demons paranoia probably most important thing is that we understand that mental illness isnt something that gets cured people have live with it it never goes away also crowe connely age this film wonderfuly so many films try age actors actresses makeup it doesnt work but here it is done flawlessly minor faults film deal with that some supporting characters are reduced props people we dont know at one point film bogs slightly when nash is trying return princeton study but these points are minor since performances main characters are so well done stories focus is them begin with crowe will probably get best actor this great film rating 8 out 10,0.5745370370370372,0.28097643097643105,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.39}"
6.0,Well Made But Lacks Integrity,"!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!Ron Howard's A BEAUTIFUL MIND shares something in common with SLEEPERS , PAPILLION and THE EXCORCISM OF EMILY ROSE in that it claims to be a true story but when you stop to examine the truth you realise that it's not really a true story at all . Perhaps I'm being unfair in comparing it to the aforementioned because in reality the story is similar to Oliver Stone's adaptation of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS in that the source material is based upon a real character but the film invents it's own version of reality Professor John Nash was a mathematical genius but he was also a bi-sexual and a rabid anti- Semite , you wouldn't know this from seeing Akiva Goldsman screenplay where he's deeply in love with Alicia . I guess centering a story around a romantic subplot adds to the film's commercial appeal , never let truth get in the way of good box office . Unfortunately the producers decide to introduce an espionage subplot where it's revealed later on is part of a schizophrenic delusion suffered by Nash . This subplot is very insulting to anyone with any knowledge or experience of schizophrenia because the victim wouldn't suffer the type of delusions seen here . He would suffer from things like abstract signals where the television would try to contact him etc , a schizophrenic wouldn't find himself meeting mysterious men in black or finding himself with a room mate who is part of his imagination etc There are somethings that make Howard's film worth seeing , things like Crowe's performance which might have won him an Oscar if it wasn't down to Academy politics . Connelly's award for best supporting actress was well deserved as was James Horner's nomination for score though perhaps Ed Harris might be upset about not being nominated for best supporting actor . I have to be honest and say that despite director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman making an interesting movie about mathematics neither of them deserved the Oscar that year . Best director and best adapted screenplay should have gone to FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING along with the Oscar for best picture And remember if you want to know about the real John Nash please read Sylvia Nasar's biography and ignore this Hollywood version",well made but lacks integrity,spoilers ron howards beautiful mind shares something common with sleepers papillion excorcism emily rose that it claims be true story but when you stop examine truth you realise that its not really true story at all perhaps im being unfair comparing it aforementioned because reality story is similar oliver stones adaptation midnight express that source material is based upon real character but film invents its own version reality professor john nash was mathematical genius but he was also bi sexual rabid anti semite you wouldnt know this seeing akiva goldsman screenplay where hes deeply love with alicia i guess centering story around romantic subplot adds films commercial appeal never let truth get way good box office unfortunately producers decide introduce espionage subplot where its revealed later is part schizophrenic delusion suffered by nash this subplot is very insulting anyone with any knowledge or experience schizophrenia because victim wouldnt suffer type delusions seen here he would suffer things like abstract signals where television would try contact him etc schizophrenic wouldnt find himself meeting mysterious men black or finding himself with room mate who is part his imagination etc there are somethings that make howards film worth seeing things like crowes performance which might have won him oscar if it wasnt down academy politics connellys award best supporting actress was well deserved as was james horners nomination score though perhaps ed harris might be upset about not being nominated best supporting actor i have be honest say that despite director ron howard writer akiva goldsman making interesting movie about mathematics neither them deserved oscar that year best director best adapted screenplay should have gone fellowship ring along with oscar best picture remember if you want know about real john nash please read sylvia nasars biography ignore this hollywood version,0.48692810457516356,0.2508169934640523,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
9.0,A big winner at Sunday's 74th annual Academy Awards..,"Schizophrenia, a disease of the brain, is one of the most disabling and emotionally devastating illnesses known to man...

Russell Crowe ventures on a journey of fear, humiliation and vulnerability, giving a real and moving portrait of a troubled man whose gifts were his downfall...

He spends his days writing perplexing formulas on his dormitory window in search of a breakthrough idea... He gets it one night, while out with his fellow scholars at a local bar where a stunning blond grabs their attention... He recreates the design of a classmate's tie reflecting light through glass... He follows the movements of pigeons as they compete for food... He stares obsessively at too many numbers, and reveals his natural ability helping the Pentagon crack the mathematical codes the Soviets are using...He becomes friend with his roommate, Charles Herman, who is everything he is not  charming and charismatic... He somewhat refines his social manners enough to win the love of a beautiful physics student who would become his wife...Then he begins to look for secret messages in newspapers and magazines, interpreting vague, undecipherable connections between letters and numbers... His mental derangement grows to uncontrolled proportions and the lines between reality and delusion begin to occur as his hallucinations take control of his life in every instant... Nash soon begins to understand the nature of his mental illness and, while he is never cured of his hallucinations behavior, eventually keeps struggling to overcome it...Crowe imparts every facet of John Nash's personality with clarity and feeling... He wins our sympathy merely by showing us a man climbing to the top, falling to the very bottom, and through love and determination fully, recapturing his potential once again...Jennifer Connelly begins to establish herself as a young actress to watch for... She exudes class and sophistication... She makes a marvelous loving wife forced to face the realities of schizophrenia... She tries to do what's best for her husband, but in the face of adversity to take the decision she does, it is inspiring to think that love is the seed of all hope, and what makes the ride worthwhile... Paul Bettany gives another charming turn as Nash's only true friend... He is able to extend any sympathy or understanding, frequently pushing Nash to leave his inquiries for a pizza and beer break...Ed Harris looks nicely menacing in his black fedora... You never know if the man is real, a delusion or both as he constantly drives Nash to the verge of insanity and beyond... Adam Goldberg makes a quiet impression as a Princeton alumnus...Ron Howard evokes the beauty of Nash's mind, and brings us with tenderness, the story of a tortured-genius... His choice to shoot much of the film from Nash's point-of-view is both effective and intriguing... The film peacefully highlights the value of a very clever man who gains a beautiful heart, mainly through the love, faith and strength of his lovely wife...",big winner at sundays 74th annual academy awards,schizophrenia disease brain is one most disabling emotionally devastating illnesses known man it is characterized by constellation distinctive predictable symptoms these include thought disorder delusions hallucinations film recounts story john forbes nash jr princeton brilliant mind who rides up heights mathematical prowess down through mental breakdown finally up regain equilibrium russell crowe ventures journey fear humiliation vulnerability giving real moving portrait troubled man whose gifts were his downfall we see him impolite rude too smart have attend class lacking social skills insulting great ideas his colleagues calling their work derivative declaring find truly original idea is only way distinguish myself nash is obsessed with patterns he spends his days writing perplexing formulas his dormitory window search breakthrough idea he gets it one night while out with his fellow scholars at local bar where stunning blond grabs their attention he recreates design classmates tie reflecting light through glass he follows movements pigeons as they compete food he stares obsessively at too many numbers reveals his natural ability helping pentagon crack mathematical codes soviets are using he becomes friend with his roommate charles herman who is everything he is not charming charismatic he somewhat refines his social manners enough win love beautiful physics student who would become his wife then he begins look secret messages newspapers magazines interpreting vague undecipherable connections between letters numbers his mental derangement grows uncontrolled proportions lines between reality delusion begin occur as his hallucinations take control his life every instant nash soon begins understand nature his mental illness while he is never cured his hallucinations behavior eventually keeps struggling overcome it crowe imparts every facet john nashs personality with clarity feeling he wins our sympathy merely by showing us man climbing top falling very bottom through love determination fully recapturing his potential once again jennifer connelly begins establish herself as young actress watch she exudes class sophistication she makes marvelous loving wife forced face realities schizophrenia she tries do whats best her husband but face adversity take decision she does it is inspiring think that love is seed all hope what makes ride worthwhile paul bettany gives another charming turn as nashs only true friend he is able extend any sympathy or understanding frequently pushing nash leave his inquiries pizza beer break ed harris looks nicely menacing his black fedora you never know if man is real delusion or both as he constantly drives nash verge insanity beyond adam goldberg makes quiet impression as princeton alumnus ron howard evokes beauty nashs mind brings us with tenderness story tortured genius his choice shoot much film nashs point view is both effective intriguing film peacefully highlights value very clever man who gains beautiful heart mainly through love faith strength his lovely wife,0.579437737536329,0.15587413369103512,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,A movie with a difference - It's realistic.,"I went along to the movies not really wanting to see this movie, thinking it was a 'girly' movie, one which had more technical skill rather than a storyline. I was surprised more than anything I could imagine. I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this movie just took me by storm. Its uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work. This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience, and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly. As for the cast, I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actors/actresses before. I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definately the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade. Perhaps politics played a bigger part than I previously would have thought.",movie with difference its realistic,i went along movies not really wanting see this movie thinking it was girly movie one which had more technical skill rather than storyline i was surprised more than anything i could imagine i have seen lot movies my time but this movie just took me by storm its uniqueness ironically enough because it was based real life situation was refreshing change usual hollywood blockbuster this movie provided brilliant pardon pun insight into many aspects genius at work this movie touched me many levels psychology movie was intriguing mathematical philosophies was actually realistic my own experience icing cake making movie stand out was surprisingly humanistic side love while love is common basis most movies interaction this theme with other aspects plot was planned phenomenlly as cast i have never noticed actual difference skill between many actors actresses before i like mel gibson tom cruise etc but i wouldnt be able pinpoint classic actors performance but russell crowe this film showed me what it was like act way where i was awe his skill playing this character especially when considering extreme difference characters his other movies such as gladiator insider russell crowe was one big reasons this movie was so brilliant added that stellar performances jennifer connelly ed harris adam goldberg this made perfect movie beautiful mind was by far most original intelligent entertaining movie i have ever seen this movie i didnt expect big things kudos ron howard cast crew this movie it was truly worthy oscar russell crowe was definately most deserving this production team miss out highest accolade perhaps politics played bigger part than i previously would have thought,0.551595744680851,0.29397163120567377,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.37}"

Instead, Opie extracts the aspects of John Nash's life and person he decided we grown-ups couldn't handle. Gone is Nash's racism, snobbery, arrest for indecent exposure, history of violent behavior, messy relationships with both sexes, the woman and son he abandoned, the voices that told him aliens were transmitting messages to him via the New York Times, the repeated stays at various loony bins, the nine months he spent wandering Europe trying to renounce his citizenship, the fact that Alicia divorced him in 1963, and that their son is schizophrenic. In short, gone is everything about Nash that made him such a enigmatic yet despicable human being to begin with.The whitewashing doesn't end there.

The cruel irony that a man who finessed a mathematical theory of rational behavior should succumb to insanity is totally lost on Opie and fellow hack Akiva Goldsman.

5.0,Well-acted but dull,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD** True story about John Forbes Nash Jr. (Russell Crowe), a brilliant mathematician, and his struggles with schizophrenia. Well-acted by Crowe, Jennifer Connelly (as his wife), Ed Harris (as a government agent) and Paul Bettany (as a college roommate) but dull dull dull!!! It's needleslly long (over 2 hours), very slow and I had a hard time staying awake. A few people walked out after about an hour--I wish I had joined them. This movie purports to be a true story. It isn't. They make Nash into a saint-like character. In real life he cheated on his wife (with women AND men), was addicted to drugs and divorced her. All this is left out of the movie to make him more acceptable for mainstream audiences. Basically though, they're lying. They end up making his character boring. Only Crowe's acting gives his character any depth. The film just moves at a turtle's pace with characters talking and talking and talking endlessly about boring subjects (the schizophrenia doesn't kick in until after an hour). Only the acting is good. Anyways, this film was made for only one reason--to win Oscars. It has a very cold, calculated feel about it. Everybody looks perfect, everything looks beautiful, there's a big lush musical score, the schizophrenia is presented tastefully--nothing to offend anybody. That is the type of film that wins Oscars--sadly this cleaned up at the Golden Globes so the Oscars might happen. It's just annoying that this movie says it's all about schizophrenia and trying to make the public aware of it, when it's actually all about winning awards and nothing more.

1.0,A Beautiful Lie,"If this movie is the nadir of Hollywood dishonest trickery and whitewashed falsehoods masquerading as fact, how does one explain its popularity? Here are some clues:In the part where the film does talk about mathematics, it makes the viewer feel that he is more intelligent than he actually is, which is always a good idea when you're aiming for the lowest common denominator and you want your picture to sell tickets in the Ozarks as well as in Hollywood.In the part where the film talks about romance, the worst possible woman's picture clichés are dragged out to show Nash as ""different"" and desirable. In actuality, he was nerdish, odd and gay.In the part that talks about his schizophrenia, terrible care is taken to avoid mentioning the fact that the 1950's persecution of homosexuals had a lot to do with Nash's worsening condition. John Nash was forced to conceal his homosexuality and was persecuted for it by the same government that expected him to decrypt secrets for them and keep quiet about it.

8.0,Moving but overrated...,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film. I'd say more, but I don't want to ruin it--especially since the film makers did such a great job in presenting Nash's mental illness--something he's struggled with for many years.I enjoyed ""A Beautiful Mind"". It was a lovely semi-fictional biography of the life of a brilliant mathematician. But, as I just said, it's SEMI-fictional--meaning a lot of the film just never occurred and the story of the man's life was often sanitized. The result is a very uplifting film...but one that is also a bit phony. And, as a retired history teacher, I hate this about the film. Additionally, I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year, as although the film did win the Best Picture award, the competition wasn't particularly strong. As a result of all these factors, I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrong--and they did here. And, incidentally, another thing that is just plain wrong was Russell Crowe's accent. I don't know where he was supposed to be from, but it was no where near West Virginia.",moving but overrated,beautiful mind is film about mathematician john nash it is very cleverly written directed as about mid way through film you learn something very very interesting about film id say more but i dont want ruin it especially since film makers did such great job presenting nashs mental illness something hes struggled with many years i enjoyed beautiful mind it was lovely semi fictional biography life brilliant mathematician but as i just said its semi fictional meaning lot film just never occurred story mans life was often sanitized result is very uplifting film but one that is also bit phony as retired history teacher i hate this about film additionally i think 2002 oscars was rather poor year as although film did win best picture award competition wasnt particularly strong as result all these factors i think film is overrated does that mean you should not watch it certainly not just understand that hollywood often gets it wrong they did here incidentally another thing that is just plain wrong was russell crowes accent i dont know where he was supposed be but it was no where near west virginia,0.6106930272108844,0.20950255102040818,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,Crowe should have won the Best Actor Oscar for this film,"Crowe does a great job of playing mathematical whiz John Nash who always had a hard time dealing with people, partially because he just didn't get them, partially because social niceties were just beside the point to him. But Nash had big dreams due to his mathematical genius until schizophrenia stole those dreams. What is great about this film is that the viewer does not know that Nash's imaginary friends are imaginary until the film reveals that fact. What is real to Nash is real to the audience, up to a point.His wife is not made out to be some kind of saint. She is frank after John is released from the hospital in that she mainly feels obligation. The anti psychotic drugs John is on make him unable to respond to her sexually, unable to carry on with his work in mathematics, unable to do much more than sit at home and stare. This is not what she signed up for, yet she stays.And after several months of this, John makes a decision to stop taking the anti-psychotic drugs, try to deal with the illusions with will and with work, and try to scratch and claw his way back into mathematics. In the 1950s he is actually allowed back on campus at Princeton where he once was faculty. Today, insurance and legal issues would take that out of the hands of Princeton itself.It's ultimately the story of how a man has to ""cut one's coat according to one's cloth"", as the old saying goes, of maybe not lowered expectations as much as slower expectations brought on by unforeseeable circumstances and obstacles.A couple of minor things I really noticed were some touches Ron Howard put into the film. One is how as the years rolled on from the 1950s into the late 1960s young people were just ruder in general. Some of the students start mimicking Nash and his odd gait for laughs. So I guess a growing lack of empathy was part of social progress? The second thing is the reality that in the mid 20th century doctors really believed in insulin shock therapy, even though it is now known to be meaningless torture. What you are actually doing is taking somebody who is not diabetic and giving them insulin which induces seizures. It has been known to lead to coma and death in actual insulin dependent diabetics who end up with an overdose due to their body just absorbing insulin and excreting their own insulin slightly differently than is normal for them day to day.Do realize this is not exactly the story of John Nash's life. He had a first marriage that he walked out on after his wife became pregnant. His second wife, Alicia, divorced him after six years of marriage in 1963. They did remarry in 2001. And Crowe definitely does not sound like he is from West Virginia, which was Nash's birthplace. But then all of these details would have been distracting and made the characters less sympathetic. After all, if I want to see the unvarnished truth about John Nash I should watch a PBS documentary, not a Hollywood movie!But back to Crowe. Although every part of this film is well crafted, his performance is the heart of the film. I believe him when he is being a jerk, when he is a socially clueless romantic clumsily courting his wife, when he is afraid for his life, afraid for his sanity, afraid for the nothingness his life could become post diagnosis, and I believe his immersion into mathematics as he battles bravely to come back to the field that he loves.I'd highly recommend this one as one of the more accessible 21st century Oscar winners.

1.0,A beautiful revisionism (dvd),"My cinema hobby is an escapist one, searching values in movies that our actual world ignores. So there's nothing worst for me that a movie that tramples morality and beauty. In this genre, this one ranks among high.It begins with the extras: 30 minutes of deleted scenes with Howard saying that they are all beautiful, perfect but it had to cut them because of the time. Where's the rule that says that this biopic must run 130 minutes exactly? The length is never fixed, it depends of the story.Then, he proposes a scene with his real father: ""cut for show business"". What are his values? Money over Family? One of the finest French director (Richard Berry) always finds a part (big or small) for his daughter in all his movies! Next, the movie starts and it's the carnival of Horror: To depict that the story happened in the 50's, Howard uses very strong golden colorization! Then, we have to believe that Crowe is a 22 years student! And ice on the cake: his delusions are ""real"", which is total nonsense. In other words, the director found brilliant to embody his delusions like normal people. I didn't know that mental illness was a fairy tale! All the power of this drama is killed at birth and it's a shame. It reminds me of the french movie ""l'adversaire"" that stars also a psychotic. This one cheats all his family for years and it's his ultimate moment that reveals his madness. With that climax, our french ""Howard"" thought also brilliantly to start the movie by the end! Well, the great error of this biopic is to treat illness like a thriller, a spy movie. Others much talented directors (Lynch) can really depict what is madness and a dangerous reality.Sadly, Jennifer isn't acting so wonderful to earn her Oscar instead of Crowe, who is really convincing as a big man becoming very fragile. If you add that the story eludes his first child, his homosexuality and his divorce (!) and that you saw all the Oscars it won, I conclude that Hollywood has really gone psychotic now!

10.0,Superb Acting and a Gem of a Film,"Ed Harris, Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Paul Bettany were terrific.The film had great balance and is worth a viewing.The story boldly addresses mental illness as a handicap.Because of the quality of the acting and directing, this movie is a beacon of hope for people of all disabilities. The film illustrates to the viewer how deeply a handicap can infiltrate the domestic, professional, and personal lives of those unfortunate to have these types of issues. I hope Ron Howard and the acting crew can get together again for something similar.
