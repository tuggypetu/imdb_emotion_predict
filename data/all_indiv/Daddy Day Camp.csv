2.0,God-awful Family Film with Little to Offer,"After sitting through the entirety of Daddy Day Camp, I have to wonder what was going through everyone's minds who were involved in the making. The most likely reason was probably them thinking, ""Is it really possible to make a movie this year that is worse than Evan Almighty and Delta Farce? Let's go for it!"" Fortunately, Daddy Day Camp is nowhere near as horrible as those other two films, but lord know that it does come very close. This abomination of a movie somehow manages to feature a great actor, Cuba Gooding, Jr., in by far his worst role yet.Anyone even slightly familiar with the first film will know the deal here. Low on money, Charlie Hinton decides to open up a camp similar to the day care service he ran in the first movie. Along the way, he must resolve problems with his father and show his son that he really loves him.Yes, I know the plot sucks. While the first movie wasn't anything to write home about, Daddy Day Camp is about a thousand times worse. In the few scenes where there is supposed to be something meaningful occurring, everything just comes off in the wrong way. It might be because everything about this careless sequel is just ridiculous. Was it really necessary to make a sequel? The first film is almost entirely disregarded and almost every role is recast (although I haven't seen the first one in quite some time so there might not be any of the original cast members returning.) When Eddie Murphy turned down the movie, they should have just dropped it and forgotten about it. He was part of what made the first movie work, to some sort of level. His manic energy, his great comedic timing, his general appealÂ… Cuba Gooding Jr. is a great actor, but this role was just altogether wrong for him. It just didn't work as well as it should have. That being said, however, he was certainly the best aspect about this utterly atrocious film.Daddy Day Camp is missing much of the magic that made the first movie watchable. None of the scene meld together very well (some of the younger characters go from heartfelt moments, to being rude to other kids for no reason to be rude and increasingly annoying) and the writing and dialogue are as unbelievable as they come. The villain is just pathetic, and the lesson that is supposed to be learned by the end of the film is a very weak one. Since none of the younger characters follow this lesson throughout the movie or seem to have learned anything by the film's end, it all feels just so useless. There are also, of course, those same old gross-out gags that you find in any boring family comedy. Here, however, they are not done as tastefully as in Underdog or as effectively as in the Cheaper By the Dozen films. In Daddy Day Camp, just like with the first film, it is pretty much lame gag after lame gag, watching flashy boring moments thrown onto the screen in the hopes that something will stick and not come off as completely and totally immature. In the first film, more often than not, most of the gags worked to a certain extent. In this film, there are very few redeeming factors, though. Barely any of those gags work. In fact, I didn't even crack a smile throughout the whole movie, and I am incredibly easy to please.Another huge problem of the film was that most of the child actors were not only annoying, but their acting was so bad that I wanted to kill myself. Each person had their moments, but the kids mostly came off as incredibly inexperienced. Movies as bad as Daddy Day Camp could at least have the common decency to provide us with a semi-likable cast of children that won't annoy us to death throughout the movie. The people who cast this predictable shame of a movie should have learned a lesson from the talents of the kids in the feature film adaption of How to Eat Fried Worms. All of those kids were incredibly likable, and I loved every minute spent with them and their childhood lives. That film is much more interesting and complex than this simplistic bore-fest that cannot even credit a single laugh to its name. With Evan Almighty, I did at least laugh quite a few times. In Daddy Day Camp, I cannot even give it that compliment. The only reason that it ended up better than Evan Almighty was because of the story between Charlie and his father. Surprisingly enough, it actually worked at times, and it worked very well I must say. And not all of the kids were completely terrible.So all in all, Daddy Day Camp was a pretty crappy movie filled with wasted talent and some of the worst child actors I've seen on screen. It is really obvious from the get-go that very little effort was put into this boring sequel. I just hope that nobody goes into this movie expecting even a relatively good movie, because it disappoints with even the lowest of expectations. 2.5/10",god awful family film with little offer,after sitting through entirety daddy day camp i have wonder what was going through everyones minds who were involved making most likely reason was probably them thinking is it really possible make movie this year that is worse than evan almighty delta farce lets go it fortunately daddy day camp is nowhere near as horrible as those other two films but lord know that it does come very close this abomination movie somehow manages feature great actor cuba gooding jr by far his worst role yet anyone even slightly familiar with first film will know deal here low money charlie hinton decides open up camp similar day care service he ran first movie along way he must resolve problems with his father show his son that he really loves him yes i know plot sucks while first movie wasnt anything write home about daddy day camp is about thousand times worse few scenes where there is supposed be something meaningful occurring everything just comes off wrong way it might be because everything about this careless sequel is just ridiculous was it really necessary make sequel first film is almost entirely disregarded almost every role is recast although i havent seen first one quite some time so there might not be any original cast members returning when eddie murphy turned down movie they should have just dropped it forgotten about it he was part what made first movie work some sort level his manic energy his great comedic timing his general appeal cuba gooding jr is great actor but this role was just altogether wrong him it just didnt work as well as it should have that being said however he was certainly best aspect about this utterly atrocious film daddy day camp is missing much magic that made first movie watchable none scene meld together very well some younger characters go heartfelt moments being rude other kids no reason be rude increasingly annoying writing dialogue are as unbelievable as they come villain is just pathetic lesson that is supposed be learned by end film is very weak one since none younger characters follow this lesson throughout movie or seem have learned anything by films end it all feels just so useless there are also course those same old gross out gags that you find any boring family comedy here however they are not done as tastefully as underdog or as effectively as cheaper by dozen films daddy day camp just like with first film it is pretty much lame gag after lame gag watching flashy boring moments thrown onto screen hopes that something will stick not come off as completely totally immature first film more often than not most gags worked certain extent this film there are very few redeeming factors though barely any those gags work fact i didnt even crack smile throughout whole movie i am incredibly easy please another huge problem film was that most child actors were not only annoying but their acting was so bad that i wanted kill myself each person had their moments but kids mostly came off as incredibly inexperienced movies as bad as daddy day camp could at least have common decency provide us with semi likable cast children that wont annoy us death throughout movie people who cast this predictable shame movie should have learned lesson talents kids feature film adaption how eat fried worms all those kids were incredibly likable i loved every minute spent with them their childhood lives that film is much more interesting complex than this simplistic bore fest that cannot even credit single laugh its name with evan almighty i did at least laugh quite few times daddy day camp i cannot even give it that compliment only reason that it ended up better than evan almighty was because story between charlie his father surprisingly enough it actually worked at times it worked very well i must say not all kids were completely terrible so all all daddy day camp was pretty crappy movie filled with wasted talent some worst child actors ive seen screen it is really obvious get go that very little effort was put into this boring sequel i just hope that nobody goes into this movie expecting even relatively good movie because it disappoints with even lowest expectations 2 5 10,0.5540652927837801,-0.039003768173936235,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.34}"
1.0,simply a horrible idea,"This movie was just awful. The plot is 2 guys who run a day care decide to take over a day camp. One of the guys, Charlie, is at odds with the guy who runs the other more fancy camp. Charlie doesn't want that guy to take over the older camp. Some of the ""funny"" parts were the cleaning up of the camp. It's always so funny to see someone fall through a roof while hammering or cleaning up a nasty bathroom. It will have you rolling in the floor, NOT!! So, the ending is the predictable competition between the 2 camps and the other camp cheats to win some of the games. But, Charlie's kid saves the day by winning.Why would Cuba Gooding be in this. He must have been desperate for a check.FINAL VERDICT: You will hate yourself if you waste 90 minutes on this.

1.0,Send Fred Savage to Movie-making Day Camp,"It is impossible to have a spoiler for this movie, because it is already rotten. At age 31, Fred Savage should know better. Directing his first feature film after years of work in television, he allows Cuba Gooding, Jr. to shamelessly mug the camera as if his eyebrows needed exercise. I have had high school student directors who exercised more restraint than this. I really don't mind fourth-grade gross-out humor either (my wife teaches fourth grade), but the bits in this sad excuse for a movie are merely gross without being remotely funny. Brown (did it have to be brown?) water gushing from the most disgustingly filthy toilet in history is not funny. Having a small boy throw up in the camp director's tent is not funny, no matter how tightly Gooding can clench his facial muscles in response. The most amateurish comedian knows that jokes have to be set up. In this movie there is no setup, there is no payoff, hence there is no joke. Having Gooding's character take a pratfall every third time he stands up doesn't help. In a theater full of families we were 50 minutes into an 80 minute movie before anyone actually laughed.It would be tedious to note every major problem in this movie. Here is one. The big bully kid (there has to be one, of course) who looks to be about twelve going on thirteen, turns out to have a bed wetting problem (note the originality of this plot twist). A big, bad Marine colonel admits that he had the same problem until he was ten. This means the bully must be under the age of ten. But in his first appearance in the movie this same kid complains, ""I wanna stay home and watch nudie movies."" For those who may have forgotten fourth grade, this is not normal nine-year-old dialog. I begin to wonder about Fred Savage's childhood. Oh, that's right. He grew up in Hollywood.There is only one exception to the annoying hyperactivity of the entire cast: the quiet dignity of Richard Gant as Gooding's Marine colonel father. An excellent actor who has never made it big, Gant almost manages to make his scenes work. The problem is that even though others are on screen at the same time, Gant is always working alone.Not even the moral of the story - and this being a ""family film"" there must be a moral - provides any redemption for this movie. The closing scenes seem to establish that if the other guys cheat, you should cheat right back. Let's hope director Savage watches a few good comedies before he tries again.",send fred savage movie making day camp,it is impossible have spoiler this movie because it is already rotten at age 31 fred savage should know better directing his first feature film after years work television he allows cuba gooding jr shamelessly mug camera as if his eyebrows needed exercise i have had high school student directors who exercised more restraint than this i really dont mind fourth grade gross out humor either my wife teaches fourth grade but bits this sad excuse movie are merely gross without being remotely funny brown did it have be brown water gushing most disgustingly filthy toilet history is not funny having small boy throw up camp directors tent is not funny no matter how tightly gooding can clench his facial muscles response most amateurish comedian knows that jokes have be set up this movie there is no setup there is no payoff hence there is no joke having goodings character take pratfall every third time he stands up doesnt help theater full families we were 50 minutes into 80 minute movie before anyone actually laughed it would be tedious note every major problem this movie here is one big bully kid there has be one course who looks be about twelve going thirteen turns out have bed wetting problem note originality this plot twist big bad marine colonel admits that he had same problem until he was ten this means bully must be under age ten but his first appearance movie this same kid complains i wanna stay home watch nudie movies those who may have forgotten fourth grade this is not normal nine year old dialog i begin wonder about fred savages childhood oh thats right he grew up hollywood there is only one exception annoying hyperactivity entire cast quiet dignity richard gant as goodings marine colonel father excellent actor who has never made it big gant almost manages make his scenes work problem is that even though others are screen at same time gant is always working alone not even moral story this being family film there must be moral provides any redemption this movie closing scenes seem establish that if other guys cheat you should cheat right back lets hope director savage watches few good comedies before he tries again,0.40525108225108225,0.017551948051948048,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
5.0,Average movie..definitely NOT worst in the history!,"This is my first comment on IMDb, because i am not very good in English. But seeing that this movie was so underrated, i cant resist to write review. This is good kid-movie! It kinda remind me my childhood. Kid's acting was not annoying, and directing - not boring. Storyline - simple, but not crazy unbelievable. Jokes makes me smile, but not laugh of course, i am probably too old for this humor :) But kids may like it very much. And most important, movie is not stupid and has some moral thoughts.It is definitely NOT 2nd worst movie in history! I see A LOT of movies every day and to half of them i am not paying attention too much or just turn off after few boring minutes.

,You'll know what you'll get even before you watch it,"One day, I would really like to see an interview with Cuba Gooding Jr. as to why he accepted one crappy movie project after another after getting an Oscar, eventually finding himself only able to get work in direct-to-DVD projects - or movies originally intended to go direct-to-DVD, as this project was. His performance here isn't exactly one that suggests he cares about how he comes across - he is constantly mugging and overacting, and it's hard to care for his character or for Gooding himself. It's also hard to care about anything else in this movie. The bad guys are cartoon characters, and the white partner of Gooding's character is given almost nothing to do. As for the rest of the protagonists, they are a group of people you will hope will fail, mainly because the kids are obnoxious stereotypes.

6.0,Family movie,"The movie starts off a bit like a slapstick, with humor more aimed at (very) young kids (although it didn't bother me that much; I'm still a child at heart). The second half of the movie is just good, when the plot picks up, evolving around a rivalry between two summer camps, intertwined with ""lessons"" about the father-son relationship. Despite that this movie is currently rated on average 1.7, I don't think that any child will be disappointed by it; they just don't vote on IMDb that young.

2.0,Not quite craptastic enough to be in the Bottom 100....but this isn't exactly high praise.,"Wow. I can only assume that either Cuba Gooding Jr.'s agent is crazy. How else can an actor go from an Oscar-winning performance in ""Jerry McGuire"" to making crap like ""Daddy Day Camp"" in a decade? As the expression goes....""my how the mighty have fallen""! Here, you know you are in for trouble when this film is meant as a DVD sequel, of sorts, to an Eddie Murphy comedy--a man whose taste in film projects in recent years has also been baffling to say the least! Both men play the same character, Charlie Hinton, and I guess we are to assume he's been through a major accident and massive plastic surgery between films--only this would explain how much Charlie has changed! So why would I choose to watch a film that from all appearances will be crap? After all, in addition to the down and out Gooding, the film also has the distinction of being on IMDb's Bottom 100 list--the 100 lowest rated films with at least 1500 ratings. Well, by this point, I've done over 8000 reviews and I've gotten bored. After watching a lot of foreign, art and independent films, I have recently decided to try watching the very worst there is to offer as a change of pace! I've already seen 41 of the 50 worst films from the Harry Medved book (""The Fifty Worst Films of All Time"") and since the other 9 just don't seem to be available, I'm now working on IMDb's list. This particular film is about the 55th film from this list I have seen. Wow, am I a glutton for punishment!! But also, I like laughing at the ineptness of many of these films--they often really are unintentionally funny. Of course, occasionally they are just horrible...period.The film begins with a Black actor and a White actor (just like in ""Daddy Day Care""--just with different actors). They are trying to find the perfect summer day camp experience for their kids. They hit upon the lame idea of re-opening the camp that they'd gone to as kids--as it's bankrupt and COULD be run successfully if they use their ""Daddy Day Care"" method they used in the last film.As for the camp, the kids and their parents are all kooky characters (or is it 'caricatures'?. Of course, things soon completely fall apart at first and things look dire for the future of the camp--especially when the folks at Camp Canola (who bear a lot of similarity to the folks at Cobra Kai) try to put them out of business and buy their land. But, given that this is a Hollywood film, you can safely assume that against all odds, everything will magically work out by the end of the movie. So what is their secret for making it all work? Charlie brings in his drill sergeant-like father, the Colonel, to help run things--since he is an organized man of action. And, of course, there is the obligatory sports competition between the nice camp and the evil one. Overall, the film isn't quite as bad as you might think, though it's all formulaic and predictable and has every clichÃ© this sort of film could possibly have. Now I am not saying it's good--but it's also pretty harmless entertainment for kids. However, I can't imagine teens or parents watching this poorly written fluff and actually enjoying it because the writing is amazingly broad and the humor awfully dim.",not quite craptastic enough be bottom 100 but this isnt exactly high praise,wow i can only assume that either cuba gooding jr s agent is crazy how else can actor go oscar winning performance jerry mcguire making crap like daddy day camp decade as expression goes my how mighty have fallen here you know you are trouble when this film is meant as dvd sequel sorts eddie murphy comedy man whose taste film projects recent years has also been baffling say least both men play same character charlie hinton i guess we are assume hes been through major accident massive plastic surgery between films only this would explain how much charlie has changed so why would i choose watch film that all appearances will be crap after all addition down out gooding film also has distinction being imdbs bottom 100 list 100 lowest rated films with at least 1500 ratings well by this point ive done over 8000 reviews ive gotten bored after watching lot foreign art independent films i have recently decided try watching very worst there is offer as change pace ive already seen 41 50 worst films harry medved book fifty worst films all time since other 9 just dont seem be available im now working imdbs list this particular film is about 55th film this list i have seen wow am i glutton punishment but also i like laughing at ineptness many these films they often really are unintentionally funny course occasionally they are just horrible period film begins with black actor white actor just like daddy day care just with different actors they are trying find perfect summer day camp experience their kids they hit upon lame idea re opening camp that theyd gone as kids as its bankrupt could be run successfully if they use their daddy day care method they used last film as camp kids their parents are all kooky characters or is it caricatures course things soon completely fall apart at first things look dire future camp especially when folks at camp canola who bear lot similarity folks at cobra kai try put them out business buy their land but given that this is hollywood film you can safely assume that against all odds everything will magically work out by end movie so what is their secret making it all work charlie brings his drill sergeant like father colonel help run things since he is organized man action course there is obligatory sports competition between nice camp evil one overall film isnt quite as bad as you might think though its all formulaic predictable has every clich this sort film could possibly have now i am not saying its good but its also pretty harmless entertainment kids however i cant imagine teens or parents watching this poorly written fluff actually enjoying it because writing is amazingly broad humor awfully dim,0.5785112847222222,-0.045633680555555535,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"

2.0,Poor,"Daddy Day Care was flawed, but actually pretty watchable. Daddy Day Camp however is a poor film. The production values are pretty good, but for me nothing else works.The story is very predictable with one too many clichÃ©d and unfunny situations, while the script is weak. The direction is lacking, the pacing is rushed and the characters are never believable. The acting is nothing special, Cuba Gooding Jnr tries hard to make something out of his character and replacing Eddie Murphy, but instead comes across as bland and annoying.

Everyone is stuck on ""Cuba won an Oscar and now he's making this?"". I thought it was a good idea not to have Cuba Gooding Jr act like Eddie. Cuba doing an ""Eddie"" impression for 90 min would have been a mistake. He's his normal neurotic/slightly geeky self. Director Fred Savage did a capable job.

5.0,Better than most reviewers say,"This film does depend too heavily on various ""stink"" jokes, but the performances are generally strong.The father-son relationship is well portrayed, especially by Cuba's father (Richard Gant). It could use more convincing development of the motivation for the ""loss"" that haunts Cuba's character so many years later. However, Lance (L. Munro) is a good, bad-guy.Paul Rae, who plays Cuba's sidekick is impressive. I've seen him called a John Goodman clone, but other than in general appearance, that isn't true. Rae gives a subtle performance that goes far beyond the usual fat-guy role.Fred Savage does a good job with the kids. All of the are realistically cute, without being over-the-top. Tyger Rawlings is good as the ""bully"", but I worked several days on this shoot and Tyger is a natural comedian. He could carry a leading comedy role with ease.A bit of trivia -- it was very cold and raining or snowing most of the days the competition scenes were shot.

This time however the studio and the director could get no one from the original movie to come back. I think the preview was funny when it said ""from the studio that brought you Daddy Day Care"", like the studio ever really matters. That's like saying, ""Yea we made that one and then we made Bikini Sluts 9"", since studios make a wide variety of movies.

5.0,Fair Family Fare without overly perverse antics,"Saw this at a sneak preview Saturday (August 4) with mostly families who were excited about being with their family members AND seeing a free movie. Cuba Gooding, Jr., is not as wildly off the wall as Eddie Murphy, nor as funny. Still, the conflict between his character and his character's father is something that many fathers and sons encounter and can relate to. The interplay between Cuba and his on screen wife is also something to which many husbands and wives can relate.Most of the laughs are for wacky, wildly inappropriate adventures, and the conflicts between Camp Driftwood and the exclusive rival camp brings up many noteworthy topics for family members to discuss long after the movie is over. This is a silly, pleasant movie, that is probably just as good on cable or DVD as it is in the movie theater. However, that being said, with so many non-family friendly movies in the theater this summer of 2007, this might be one of the better movies for the family to see before school is back in session.",fair family fare without overly perverse antics,saw this at sneak preview saturday august 4 with mostly families who were excited about being with their family members seeing free movie cuba gooding jr is not as wildly off wall as eddie murphy nor as funny still conflict between his character his characters father is something that many fathers sons encounter can relate interplay between cuba his screen wife is also something which many husbands wives can relate most laughs are wacky wildly inappropriate adventures conflicts between camp driftwood exclusive rival camp brings up many noteworthy topics family members discuss long after movie is over this is silly pleasant movie that is probably just as good cable or dvd as it is movie theater however that being said with so many non family friendly movies theater this summer 2007 this might be one better movies family see before school is back session,0.6045833333333334,0.3591666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.28}"
4.0,a bad sequel,"i saw the first part in the cinema and the second ant home, not expecting much. I was right, the movie was boring and not much funny at all, the first thing was that Eddie Murphy was missing, he did an great job in the first part and gave a lot to the humorous part of the movie. This second part had a more serious lead actor that does bot seem to be funny enough. The idea was also a bit boring and one-sided. Predictable and lacking reality. The kinds also had no idea about acting and that had its on contribution to the boringness of the movie. What else to say than the characters were not developed enough... one by one, the puzzle shows to be boring, predictable and plain humor.

2.0,Don't Bother,"The first film in this series was okay, a lighthearted comedy that managed to appeal to different age groups. The sequel is so much different that... well, it really isn't a sequel. Every roll has been recast. The plot, instead of being humorous, is nonexistent. Eddie Murphy, who was a highlight of the original, isn't here. The children seem passive-aggressive, one moment having a heartfelt conversation and the next screaming at each other or breaking into a snack shack for ice cream. But the real problem is, this film is just... not funny. It tries to be, and several scenes, if they were in another film, would have been. However, the idiocy of the plot, stale acting, and psychologically disturbed children take away from a possible slapstick laugh. Of course, the adults are stupid too. Why have a mock-war with someone who vandalizes your camp? Why not just call the police? Great things to teach three-year-olds, alright. Other things they love to teach kids? Underlying stereotypes run rampant in the film. There are scenes where girls, ""jocks"", and ""gamers"", are all stereotyped, (albeit unfairly). If this film were actually funny, there would be nothing to complain about. But the stereotyping is actually serious, and comes off a little strangely. The only highlight of this film is the man who plays Cuba Gooding's father. Never seen him before, but being able to actually act well in this mockery of a movie awards him some merit.",dont bother,first film this series was okay lighthearted comedy that managed appeal different age groups sequel is so much different that well it really isnt sequel every roll has been recast plot instead being humorous is nonexistent eddie murphy who was highlight original isnt here children seem passive aggressive one moment having heartfelt conversation next screaming at each other or breaking into snack shack ice cream but real problem is this film is just not funny it tries be several scenes if they were another film would have been however idiocy plot stale acting psychologically disturbed children take away possible slapstick laugh course adults are stupid too why have mock war with someone who vandalizes your camp why not just call police great things teach three year olds alright other things they love teach kids underlying stereotypes run rampant film there are scenes where girls jocks gamers are all stereotyped albeit unfairly if this film were actually funny there would be nothing complain about but stereotyping is actually serious comes off little strangely only highlight this film is man who plays cuba goodings father never seen him before but being able actually act well this mockery movie awards him some merit,0.55234375,0.03684895833333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.28}"
7.0,"May seem like Deja Vu all over again, but if it inspires laughter, no one cares!","Charlie (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Phil (Paul Rae) have been running their successful Daddy DayCare for several years now. However, summer vacation starts and the kid care guys are ready for a break. Not so fast! Charlie's wife thinks it would be good for their now elementary ages son to go to day CAMP. This horrifies Charlie, who hates bugs, snakes and competitive sports. But, when he finally agrees, there is no other camp choice but the one he, Charlie, went to, Driftwood. Driving out to the woods, though, with his son and Phil, they are astonished by a couple of things. First, there is a flashy day camp just next to Driftwood, run by an medal-winning and obnoxious Olympic athlete (Lochlyn Munro). Secondly, Driftwood is about to go under from the competition and is extremely rundown. Guess who steps in to turn it around, Charlie and Phil, that's who. Good at promotion, they snag a bus load of kids for their first week. But, after exposing the kids to poison ivy, wet boots, getting lost among the trees, etc., they lose a good deal of the children to the nearby ""super"" camp. Not wanting to be defeated, Charlie calls on his retired Marine-father colonel, Buck (Richard Gant). to help save the day, even though they have crossed horns many times. Eventually, the wangle more kids AND a day of competition with their foes next door. Who will win? Viewers may think they are traveling down Deja Vu lane, which is true, but the movie still hits the funnybone. The cast is one big reason, for Gooding, Jr., Paul, Munroe, Gant and the rest enthusiastically play out the slapstick script.

3.0,Creatively bankrupt,"In the midst of big blockbusters and award-winning films, it's all too easy to forget that most of Hollywood's output is stale, rehashed trash. That is, until you come face-to-face with one of those films. This is a boring, by the numbers film designed purely to cash in on the nostalgia of American parents for something they did when they were young. No one working on it had any idea how to make the characters' motivations fit the script, and the result is a cast of unlikeable characters who make stupid decisions. The entire premise for the story falls apart when you realise the main character could have just called the police on the other camp and solved all his problems, but no, Hollywood has to fill its quota of films teaching manly self-reliance as a religious absolute, and that the little guy can always stick it to the man if he believes (despite the mountains of evidence that this approach fails 99.9% of the time). If this worked, why is there a police force? Why are there laws? Above all, why is it 'the man' keeps promoting this message via terrible children's films?Aside from the crippling problems with the overall story, this so called comedy only ever attempts jokes on a par with The Garbage Pail Kids Movie. Your film has a problem if it's possible to draw parallels between characters in your film and TGPKM based on the disgusting qualities of the characters. The resolution of the film even has similarities to that of TGPKM, with protagonists winning various events using skills such as projectile vomiting, or throwing urine over another child.This is an awful film.

7.0,Decent family film,"I don't think this film is that bad. It's for kids...no question about that. It's just a fun movie with the kind of very light raunch that kids like (like an occasional fat). The emotional aspect is that a father and son learn to see each other's strengths. Not a bad lesson to learn. And that, in turn, is passed on to another father and son. It also teaches a lesson about cheating.Cuba Gooding is one actor I sort of feel sorry for. I don't feel too sorry for him...he's supposedly worth about $15 million, but his career has not fulfilled its early promise. I think there have been a number of bad selections of projects to work in. But I like him in a film. He does fine here as the co-owner of Daddy Day Care.Lochlyn Munro plays Gooding's childhood enemy and the owner of a rival camp. He does fine, also, though I imagine he's a more limited actor than Gooding. Richard Gant plays Gooding's somewhat estranged father -- a retired military officer who takes army tasks too seriously. He's good here. Interestingly, Spencir Bridges, who plays Gooding's son, is the real life son of Todd Bridges.He was quite good here.Look, it ain't Shakespeare. Nor was it intended to be.
