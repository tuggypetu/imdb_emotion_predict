9,"A Wonderful Tale Of Horror, Deception, Life & Love!","While most of the new-age films are related to drama, comedy and sci-fi, débutante Karthik is a guy from whom I will expect more thrilling movies.Pizza tells you a story of a pizza-delivery guy who gets entangled in a story of horror, love and deception. The first part is a juxtaposition of initiation, life and horror. While the second half is where it gets horrid, severe and mind-blowing. The genre of this sort changes as you proceed and every genre will make you even more interested. The screenplay is terrific and the camera-work is just par excellence. The background score just adds to the thrills. Boy, this is one Tamil movie I could see again and again.The plot is very rare and ingenious. Performances are pure and inventive. Except a very big hole in the plot that I found with the help of my critic sister, Pizza is a very good entertainer, spine-chilling horror movie and thought-provoking piece of cinema. And the ending just makes it a movie with great climax which can easily be said in one line: As you sow, so shall you reap!WATCH OUT FOR: Vijay and his anecdote!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

10,One of the Most exciting movie experiences I ever had!!,"I saw this movie with a friend, not knowing anything about the story, just with the idea that the movie is good. And I had surprise waiting in the theater. It was the most exciting movie for me as far as I can remember (after Kanchana - which was again a Tamil Horror movie, which exciting to watch in the theater too) It is a movie which has to be watched in a good theater a loads of people to scream and cry along with you, which makes the movie experience the best. If you missed theater, I would suggest watching it in Home theater, with lots of friends who haven't seen the movie too. Now as for the technical aspects, the editing, cinematography and music are great plus along with Karthik Subburaj's excellent narration makes it an wonderful One time watch.

8,"Probably, The best use of ""Deux Ex Machina"" ever done in thriller genre. Meet World's First horror-con-thriller ever.","Pizza (2012) : Brief Review -Probably, The best use of ""Deux Ex Machina"" ever done in thriller genre. Meet World's First horror-con-thriller ever. I think i have given away too much in the first two lines only which might turn a big spoiler unless you don't think about it too much. So, first you should know what is ""Deux Ex Machina"". If you know it then it's great and if you don't then please go to Wikipedia and read about it there. That will save some copy-paste work for me in this BRIEF review. So, now you know what that term means basically and let me tell you it's not complex as you think. Actually, we all have been through it with many comedy films over the years but just didn't think that it could mean something intricate like this. So better leave it UNSOLVED and that's what it means here. Pizza is horror film but we all know that there's nothing like ghosts and all so we start finding solid reasons for it. Remember, Malayalam Classic 'Manichitrathazu'? Even that belongs to horror genre but as we all know it's not a real thing so we start finding logic into it. That film provides it by the perfect use of Psychological medical terms so while watching Pizza you also wish there would be something logical at the end to cover all the unrealistic loopes. It's a sign of an intelligent movie viewer who easily don't believe in spilled stuff and rather likes to wait for intriguing turnarounds. With Pizza, the same thing happens. They show you horror images because you are a smart movie buff, you don't believe it and wait for the suspense to get revealed. A pizza delivery boy lands in a mysterious circumstance and it works a dramatic change in his life. I am not spoiling anything here because i want you to watch the film without any speculations and i am sure it will blow you away. It's little predictable but still very hooked and surprising. Thanks to Team Pizza for trying something different and for me that's the best thing about it.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",probably best use deux ex machina ever done thriller genre meet worlds first horror con thriller ever,pizza 2012 brief review probably best use deux ex machina ever done thriller genre meet worlds first horror con thriller ever i think i have given away too much first two lines only which might turn big spoiler unless you dont think about it too much so first you should know what is deux ex machina if you know it then its great if you dont then please go wikipedia read about it there that will save some copy paste work me this brief review so now you know what that term means basically let me tell you its not complex as you think actually we all have been through it with many comedy films over years but just didnt think that it could mean something intricate like this so better leave it unsolved thats what it means here pizza is horror film but we all know that theres nothing like ghosts all so we start finding solid reasons it remember malayalam classic manichitrathazu even that belongs horror genre but as we all know its not real thing so we start finding logic into it that film provides it by perfect use psychological medical terms so while watching pizza you also wish there would be something logical at end cover all unrealistic loopes its sign intelligent movie viewer who easily dont believe spilled stuff rather likes wait intriguing turnarounds with pizza same thing happens they show you horror images because you are smart movie buff you dont believe it wait suspense get revealed pizza delivery boy lands mysterious circumstance it works dramatic change his life i am not spoiling anything here because i want you watch film without any speculations i am sure it will blow you away its little predictable but still very hooked surprising thanks team pizza trying something different me thats best thing about it rating 8 10 by,0.45754477004477007,0.2302808302808303,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.52, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.3}"
3,"With an egregious use of deus ex machina, Pizza leaves a bad taste in our mouths and we feel cheated.","It is 'Pizza' which should be charged for cheating its audience with an overloaded use of 'deus ex machina'. Before I move further, let me explain what the term 'deus ex machina' signifies the same way film critic Roger Ebert did while reviewing Spike Jonze's delectable 'Adaptation' – by quoting from Wikipedia; the term is used for 'a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved, with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object'. While Adaptation is able to inventively, ingeniously and effectively fit this device into its plot structure, Pizza leaves its audience puzzled searching for answers only to reveal after that important pieces were kept hidden from them all the while. The only purpose of its deus ex machina is for its writer- director Karthik Subbaraj to show just how 'unbelievable' his twist is; the problem is that the audience doesn't go 'Oh, how could I miss this!' in Pizza because the film's plot never allowed them to catch it in the first place. The twist takes the film to an altogether new tangent which we couldn't have guessed at all, and we are left cold: I want my money back!Pizza opens with a group of ghost hunters scanning for paranormal activity in a supposedly haunted house, which ends in a cliffhanger the moment their device detects a presence. That's when our lead actor switches off the television on which the 'movie' was running and we're taken to the actual setting where our lead couple is cuddled up, talking about ghosts. We learn that the lady Anu is a writer of horror stories and is researching by watching a number of films and books while her guy Michael is a pizza delivery man who has his reservations about anything supernatural. While delivering a file to his boss' home, Michael finds out that his boss' daughter is possibly possessed by a spirit and her father is desperately trying to cure her. This incident haunts him especially because the girl looks directly at him while possessed and screams out the name 'Nithya!' demonically. The other incident that besets him is Anu's announcement that she's pregnant, but they reconcile and get married privately. One night, he is found by the owner in the pizza joint covered in blood along with his colleagues, who are also bruised badly. He then tells the others about his nightmarish experience at a home where he had gone to deliver pizzas. After this incident, Anu goes missing and attempts to locate her also fail.The film failed to give me anything to search for, and Subbaraj left missing too many things which could have made my attempts easier in finding some sense in the film. You should be able to tease your audience throughout in a manner that when they are tricked, they don't feel cheated. In a great movie like M. Night Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense', the twist didn't need a major clarification because we knew we were sold by it, and later we could sit and think of all the subtle hints we missed during the film. In Pizza, the twist fails badly and the most explicit proof for its failure is the fact that it required about five to ten minutes of clarifications in the resolution to show us how it actually worked. This time is taken in revealing things that weren't shown to us at all before, and could've simplified our confusion without losing the intended twist's effectiveness.Although I commend Karthik Subbaraj's attempt of blending the genres of horror, suspense, comedy, thriller and mystery, his film Pizza fails to whet our appetite. We leave the theatre with a bad taste in our mouths. (note: I watched two films of Vijay Sethupathi in two days, Soodhu Kavvum yesterday and Pizza today, without realizing until checking his Wikipedia page that he was one and the same actor! That's some good acting!)More on sashankkini.wordpress.com/",with egregious use deus ex machina pizza leaves bad taste our mouths we feel cheated,it is pizza which should be charged cheating its audience with overloaded use deus ex machina before i move further let me explain what term deus ex machina signifies same way film critic roger ebert did while reviewing spike jonzes delectable adaptation by quoting wikipedia term is used plot device whereby seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly abruptly resolved with contrived unexpected intervention some new event character ability or object while adaptation is able inventively ingeniously effectively fit this device into its plot structure pizza leaves its audience puzzled searching answers only reveal after that important pieces were kept hidden them all while only purpose its deus ex machina is its writer director karthik subbaraj show just how unbelievable his twist is problem is that audience doesnt go oh how could i miss this pizza because films plot never allowed them catch it first place twist takes film altogether new tangent which we couldnt have guessed at all we are left cold i want my money back pizza opens with group ghost hunters scanning paranormal activity supposedly haunted house which ends cliffhanger moment their device detects presence thats when our lead actor switches off television which movie was running were taken actual setting where our lead couple is cuddled up talking about ghosts we learn that lady anu is writer horror stories is researching by watching number films books while her guy michael is pizza delivery man who has his reservations about anything supernatural while delivering file his boss home michael finds out that his boss daughter is possibly possessed by spirit her father is desperately trying cure her this incident haunts him especially because girl looks directly at him while possessed screams out name nithya demonically other incident that besets him is anus announcement that shes pregnant but they reconcile get married privately one night he is found by owner pizza joint covered blood along with his colleagues who are also bruised badly he then tells others about his nightmarish experience at home where he had gone deliver pizzas after this incident anu goes missing attempts locate her also fail film failed give me anything search subbaraj left missing too many things which could have made my attempts easier finding some sense film you should be able tease your audience throughout manner that when they are tricked they dont feel cheated great movie like m night shyamalans sixth sense twist didnt need major clarification because we knew we were sold by it later we could sit think all subtle hints we missed during film pizza twist fails badly most explicit proof its failure is fact that it required about five ten minutes clarifications resolution show us how it actually worked this time is taken revealing things that werent shown us at all before couldve simplified our confusion without losing intended twists effectiveness although i commend karthik subbarajs attempt blending genres horror suspense comedy thriller mystery his film pizza fails whet our appetite we leave theatre with bad taste our mouths note i watched two films vijay sethupathi two days soodhu kavvum yesterday pizza today without realizing until checking his wikipedia page that he was one same actor thats some good acting more sashankkini wordpress com,0.47773892773892795,-0.022719988344988336,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9,"A Bit Wonkey, but not bad","This is an unconventional film (in terms of the Hollywood standards I'm used to, at least). Unconventional movies have their ups and downs. In some ways they're annoying. One example of this is the general plot structure of this film. The movie feels fairly jumbled and messy because there are many different perspectives in it that don't entirely mesh and the tension does not build evenly to a climax like it does in most films. That said, there are also great things about unconventional movies. This movies feels like a breath of fresh air in many ways especially considering how formulaic most horror films are these days. There are some parts of this film that are fairly tropey, but I think in general the movie is fairly self-aware. It audaciously avoids some of the most pernicious tropes and puts a new spin on a lot familiar setups. The film is really pretty innovating, but it feels more strange than revolutionary, so I guess Karthik Subbaraj didn't get it quite right. It is well made, however. The acting is good especially compared to the one other Tamil movie I've seen. The cinematography is also good. Probably the best technical aspect of the film is the sound design although the soundtrack is a little spotty.",bit wonkey but not bad,this is unconventional film terms hollywood standards im used at least unconventional movies have their ups downs some ways theyre annoying one example this is general plot structure this film movie feels fairly jumbled messy because there are many different perspectives it that dont entirely mesh tension does not build evenly climax like it does most films that said there are also great things about unconventional movies this movies feels like breath fresh air many ways especially considering how formulaic most horror films are these days there are some parts this film that are fairly tropey but i think general movie is fairly self aware it audaciously avoids some most pernicious tropes puts new spin lot familiar setups film is really pretty innovating but it feels more strange than revolutionary so i guess karthik subbaraj didnt get it quite right it is well made however acting is good especially compared one other tamil movie ive seen cinematography is also good probably best technical aspect film is sound design although soundtrack is little spotty,0.5363035113035114,0.2523493867243867,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.2}"

1,Worst horror movie I've ever watched!,"I went in with very high expectations because of the review score of 8 (upon initial posting of this review). The opening elevator sequence should have made me stop watching it already, but somehow I was dupe-d that the movie will get better eventually, but I was so wrong. The scare tactics kept on breaking my suspension of disbelief. The movie even tries to justify this at the end, but even the resolution was even a try-hard at being intelligent. It was as if every piece of the material was aimed at being a plot device and justify the ending. Usually, movies with plot twists develop organically, wherein the journey itself makes the story and the twist is just an icing on the cake (e.g. Mother by Bong Joon Ho)",worst horror movie ive ever watched,i went with very high expectations because review score 8 upon initial posting this review opening elevator sequence should have made me stop watching it already but somehow i was dupe d that movie will get better eventually but i was so wrong scare tactics kept breaking my suspension disbelief movie even tries justify this at end but even resolution was even try hard at being intelligent it was as if every piece material was aimed at being plot device justify ending usually movies with plot twists develop organically wherein journey itself makes story twist is just icing cake e g mother by bong joon ho,0.5770740740740741,-0.0704074074074074,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"
