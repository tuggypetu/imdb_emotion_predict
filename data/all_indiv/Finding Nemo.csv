8.0,"Yes, it's THAT good !!","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it. I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",yes its that good,ill be totally honest confirm you that everything what they say about this movie is true its brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots humor that actually works plot that really brings tears your eyes time time modern artists pixar never cease amaze audience expanding their horizons finding nemo is visually stunning you can have nothing but respect people who created it i was more or less skeptic about watching it because it was so overhyped two days before it got released my country tv press loudly announced that dvd broke all records usa during its first release day thats usually sign being typically mainstream fake but finding nemo is not im allergic fake sentiment pathetic feel good movies but i was really touched by this one moral valuable life lessons are always present but theyre not shoved down your throat or thrown your face all time this movie really relativates itself thats important good comedy its hilarious every side character finding nemo there are lot them is exceptional worth mention voices are cast perfectly as well like voice willem dafoe gill example perfect choice character dory speaks through voice ellen degeneres steals show shes adorable blue fish who suffers amnesia she forgets what shes doing or going every five minutes that really leads hilarious situations movies like this arent just being made children exclusive theyre good everyone realize you have entertain yourself time time just enjoy little things life i recommend this everyone world no matter if youre 9 or 99 years old finding nemo will bring smile your face leave behind warm feeling your heart,0.5729974160206719,0.20558785529715765,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,Pixar's best feature to date,"I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"" to DreamWorks films like ""Shrek."" But ""Finding Nemo"" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the ""Toy Story"" movies and in ""Monsters Inc.,"" but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in ""Finding Nemo,"" as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of ""Far Side"" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.The story employs the same basic formula used in ""Toy Story,"" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, ""Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat."" That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.",pixars best feature date,i have enjoyed most computer animated films made so far ranging pixar films like toy story incredibles dreamworks films like shrek but finding nemo is one that remains unparalleled not because its comedy or creativity both which are equaled toy story movies monsters inc but because it truly more than any previous computer animated features reinvents genre childrens animated film humor traditional animation is usually based broad slapstick physical exaggeration there are occasional nods this brand humor finding nemo as when flock seagulls ram into boat we see their beaks crowing other side sail but such sequences only call attention how far this movie generally departs old cartoon conventions instead movie invests its world sentient animals with surprisingly scientific texture all animals are based real species fish tank is constructed out real devices there is strong sense locale as marlin albert brooks travels across pacific australia where even animals speak with australian accent scene that im sure gary larson far side fame loved pelican discusses with group fish intricate details dentistry fact that animals talk understand whats going is treated as though it were natural feature world realism is so striking that by end film youll almost believe it possible fish plot escape tank far making film pedantic this approach results intelligent but still entertaining picture most humor is based parodies human behavior repentant sharks start club thats like alcoholics anonymous school fish act like obnoxious djs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns four year old girl behaves like most kids that age oblivious destructive manner which marlin finds his way his son is so inventive that we can forgive film number coincidences involved story employs same basic formula used toy story which two characters one uptight other clueless are thrown together as theyre forced journey through world populated by creatures that are lot more knowing than humans realize this movie however creates unique character dory ellen degeneres fish with short term memory loss give cartoon character real human disorder is risky say least im glad filmmakers didnt lose nerve include this ingenious device which not only generates some films biggest laughs but reinforces character interaction that is so central story this is fact only pixar film feature true character development course his voyage marlin learns be more adventurous getting parenting tips surfer dude turtle voiced by films director andrew stanton while his son nemo learns be self reliant course none sharks jellyfish whales gulls pelicans lobsters humans that marlin encounters along way really mean any harm theyre just doing what they do as nigel pelican tells nemo at one point fish gotta swim birds gotta eat thats perhaps films most interesting insight that there are no true villains just creatures that act according their nature few that transcend it,0.5592791005291005,0.19361111111111107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.44}"
,amazing visuals,"Has there ever been a better-looking feature-length animated film than `Finding Nemo'? We doubt it. With its shimmering underwater landscapes - be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium - the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before. The fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eye-popping, many-hued visual splendor.Although the script by Andrew Stanton doesn't scale the comedic heights of, say, `Aladdin,' `Shrek' or `Toy Story 2,' it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing. I hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and off-color humor that have blighted so much alleged `kiddie' fare in recent years. This is a film on e can watch with one's children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so. Creators of children's films please take note (and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take).Like many tales designed for the junior set (`Dumbo,' `Bambi' etc.), `Finding Nemo' taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents - and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children. It is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film. In this case, it is little Nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia. The subject of the film's title is Marlin, Nemo's overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke. Along the way, this Nervous Nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and Nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is.Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love. Those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their live-action performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying.As directed by Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and executed by an army of wonder-working animators and technicians, `Finding Nemo' takes PIXAR technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection - till the studio's next release, that is.",amazing visuals,has there ever been better looking feature length animated film than finding nemo we doubt it with its shimmering underwater landscapes be they vast immensity limitless ocean or cramped confines dentist office aquarium film sports look unlike anything we have ever seen before fish tank setting particular is veritable wonderland eye popping many hued visual splendor although script by andrew stanton doesnt scale comedic heights say aladdin shrek or toy story 2 it still sparkles with enough wit inventiveness entrance youngsters beguile grownups who will be joining them their viewing i hasten point out that screenplay is blessedly free all double entendres off color humor that have blighted so much alleged kiddie fare recent years this is film e can watch with ones children grandchildren not once have blush or turn away embarrassment while doing so creators childrens films please take note take note too its phenomenal box office take like many tales designed junior set dumbo bambi etc finding nemo taps into fear all children have being separated their parents concomitant fear all parents have being separated their children it is upon this common ground that members both generations will meet their emotional response this film this case it is little nemo adorable clownfish who is plucked out ocean plunked down into saltwater aquarium dentist sydney australia subject films title is marlin nemos overprotective worrywart dad who swims his way towards continent find rescue his little tyke along way this nervous nellie parent learns little something about giving his son freedom boy needs grow up become man nemo himself learns thing or two about just what kind fish his dad really is albert brooks ellen degeneres are brilliant as marlin dory respectively latter befuddled daffy utterly good natured fish who helps marlin his epic quest not only his lost son but his own definition filial love those familiar with these two fine comedic talents their live action performances will actually be able see many their distinctive inflections facial expressions reflected animated characters they are portraying as directed by stanton lee unkrich executed by army wonder working animators technicians finding nemo takes pixar technology its ultimate final level perfection till studios next release that is,0.5145138888888889,0.2002493686868687,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"
8.0,Another Disney/Pixar Classic,"Those guys and girls at Disney/Pixar have done it again, they've created the perfect underwater world, full of fascinating Disney characters.A truly enchanting story of a father (Marlon) who loses his son (Nemo), and with help of his new found friend (Dory) ventures out into the ocean to try to find him. On this epic voyage he gets to battle sharks, surf with some turtle dudes, dice with some jellyfish and survive an encounter in a whales stomach.All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but my favourite is Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, pure genius.All in all this is another success for Disney and Pixar, It brings out the child in all of us.Solid family fun 8/10",another disney pixar classic,those guys girls at disney pixar have done it again theyve created perfect underwater world full fascinating disney characters truly enchanting story father marlon who loses his son nemo with help his new found friend dory ventures out into ocean try find him this epic voyage he gets battle sharks surf with some turtle dudes dice with some jellyfish survive encounter whales stomach all characters are vibrant with disney charm but my favourite is dory comic relief probably one funniest disney characters ever written superbly voiced by ellen degeneres pure genius all all this is another success disney pixar it brings out child all us solid family fun 8 10,0.4396103896103897,0.31314162028447745,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"
10.0,Swimming with Sharks is a Whale of a Time,"Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes  from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes  ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents.",swimming with sharks is whale time,marlin nervous neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective his son nemo who only wants explore sea its entirety when nemo gets caught by scuba diver taken away it is up marlin swallow his own fears find nemo ensuing search rescue organized by him is mass effort by swimming flying creatures all sizes personalities such as threesome vegetarian sharks fish with short term memory aged turtle all helping him realise error his ways restricting himself just his home as charming as it is beautiful finding nemo is joy both visually cinematically characters are all so appealing sweet that you want hug each every one them nemo dory particular but film transcends above just generic animated film there are lessons be learnt by it too film often tells childrens tale adults point view with risky situations emotional soul searching putting stress disjointed family sea is brought us such memorable unique way that there is brilliance beauty every frame animation is all time high pixar sound mixing editing are also be credited as they capture heart sea creditably but perhaps best thing about film is musical score by thomas newman he creates essence sea as well as emotions felt by fish throughout note masterwork that occurs as upbeat jovial number quickly escalates into something darker matter minutes short music is superb voice cast are capable cannily chosen young alexander gould as na ve nemo as well as albert brooks as bumbling marlin but star show is ellen degeneres as dory as forgetful but caring fish she is sweet soulful provides much comedy film but humour is also provided by great script which delivers potentially dull story with wit soul shies away sentimentality that could so easily arise disney film jokes what jokes satire spoof slapstick theyll be one liner everybody here gorgeous look at utterly adorable finding nemo sets standard how animated movies should being terms entertainment value as well as story themes ending with touching thought provoking message how too much protectiveness parents side will repel but no matter how independent child or fish believes themselves be theyll always need their parents,0.49599206349206343,0.26492063492063495,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
9.0,Who said fish are boring?,"""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.

8.0,Pixar Remains the Best Family Film Industry Out There Today...,"Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2 and ""Monsters, Inc."" are some of my favorite family films; ""Finding Nemo"" isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like ""A Bug's Life,"" and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.As always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In ""Toy Story"" they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" they showed us the monster world. In my review on ""A Bug's Life,"" I said that the reason the film didn't work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because ""Finding Nemo"" is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.This tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.Years later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot's son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)Pixar doesn't let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.""Finding Nemo"" gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist's office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe's vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist's tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie ""Platoon"" might have something to do with that.This is taken from my ""Monsters, Inc."" review: ""Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my 'Toy Story' review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for 'Toy Story 3') and gives them the bare minimum.With ""Finding Nemo,"" I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they separate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it's almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself.",pixar remains best family film industry out there today,pixar animation studios has very good knack making thoughtful intelligent humorous family films note that i didnt say kid films toy story 1 2 monsters inc are some my favorite family films finding nemo isnt one my favorites but it isnt disappointing like bugs life it is thoughtful intelligent humorous incredibly watchable just like other pixar films as always pixar takes world something completely builds their story around it toy story they gave life toys created world through their eyes monsters inc they showed us monster world my review bugs life i said that reason film didnt work very much is because it was about bugs not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories well i guess i was sorta wrong because finding nemo is all about fish nothing too mystical about fish i still loved it this tale takes place underwater with fish marlin voiced by albert brooks whose spouse baby fish eggs get eaten by vicious shark beginning all but one egg which marlin names nemo years later nemo voiced by alexander gould elliots son is bit older heading off fish school first time but haunted by fact that his spouse offspring were all killed years ago marlin is extremely over protective his one remaining family member nemo sick being treated like baby proves how brave he is by swimming near fishing boat only be captured by scuba diving dentist so marlin heads off find nemo with help his newfound companion dory voice ellen degeneres who has short term memory loss forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out like when she is showing marlin way towards fishing boat suddenly forgets why marlin is following her pixar doesnt let down audience this film there are few things that one can always expect pixar films they can expect something such as toys be given their own world they can expect that world be given careful attention detail they can expect humor finding nemo gives fish their own world underwater realm they live is paid careful attention painstakingly captured film with computer graphics humor is always there all characters are funny i especially like sequences inside fish tank dentists office with bunch fish including gill willem dafoes vocal talents who constantly tries escape by doing so gill has suffered major injuries including landing dentists tools getting sliced up this is course parody escaping pows fact that willem dafoe was great war movie platoon might have something do with that this is taken my monsters inc review pixar once again not only expands our mind but our very worlds i respect their company commitment values very much as you can read my toy story review they stick values that made disney films so family friendly back fifties sixties respect audience respect quality respect audiences intelligence something disney who has recently coughed up bunch lousy thoughtless sequels has forgotten now i know that legally disney is co creator toy story monsters inc but they really are not they just give pixar money get their name branded front box film even then i have heard multiple claims that disney is very mean spirited towards pixar read into sequel trouble toy story 3 gives them bare minimum with finding nemo i still stick towards what i said pixar animation studios is probably best family film company out there right now i really hope they separate disney some day form their own production company they know what interests both kids adults its almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging fun watch this is one take kids afterwards maybe even sneak back into again by yourself,0.5517751924001926,0.1648508078621715,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,"""Finding"" A Flight odf Fancy","Remember back when you were little.you know, back when tall to you was about as high as a mailbox? In those days, Disney animated films (e.g. `Lion King' and `Beauty and the Beast') were some of the coolest things out there and were movies to watch over and over (much to your parents' chagrin). Now, animated movies aren't exactly the `coolest' things to see, but an exception can be made for the uber-hip Pixar movies, the most recent of which being `Finding Nemo'.After losing all but one of his brood, Marlin (Albert Brooks) an over-protective clown fish that strangely lacks a sense of humor, has resolved to protect his one (slightly disabled) `child' remaining, Nemo (Alexander Gould). But disaster strikes as Nemo is taken by a Sydney dentist and plopped into a fish tank where he is comforted by a host of other captive fish (William Dafoe, Vicki Lewis, Allison Janney, et al). But back in the big ocean Down Under, Marlin has resolved to search out his one remaining progeny.Along the way on his quest, Marlin acquires a tag-along `friend', Dory (Ellen DeGeneres)-a fish with, well, the memory capacity of a fish. The two must surmount hurdles like a group of sharks (Eric Bana, Barry Humphries and Bruce Spence) that have (mostly) sworn off eating other fish, a nasty swarm of jellyfish, a bird-brained flock of seagulls, and others.This is the bridge! Well, in a way. Back when I was younger, one of my favorite films was `The Incredible Mr. Limpet', which, for the uninitiated, combined live-action with under-the-sea fish animation. What Pixar has done here was bring back that film to my mind and start me thinking, because they have created a wondrous undersea environment (with `normal-looking' fish instead of 1960s animated fish).My favorite feature in this movie chock-full of sweet treats must be the sharks. I have always been partial to the shark family, but what has been done in creating three humorous sharks (what a movie concept), just sent paroxysms of laughter through me. Another thing that (mostly) works is Ellen DeGeneres' fish (character?) that provides a fairly constant source of laughter with her antics (although a couple gags do wear on the viewer with time). On the whole though, there is not a single bit of shoddy voice-acting or animation in it.Compared to `Monsters Inc.', `Finding Nemo' is something of a revival for Pixar. I like how they have stepped up their efforts to make an altogether pleasing film without any big flaws. The thing that I did not like with `Monsters' was the inclusion of a single key (but EXTREMELY annoying) character.

,quite a catch,"Pixar Studios have done it again. I have to say that these guys are totally good in computer animation, as well as in storytelling. Rarely do those qualities come together but here they are, delivering unto the audience once again something that one can only be drowned with wonder. Such is the marvel of Finding Nemo.The story is about Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a young clownfish who is fed up with his dad Marlin's (Albert Brooks) excessive paranoia over him. He swims to a place where his dad forbids him and ends up being captured by a scuba diver. He is then placed in a fish tank in a dental clinic somewhere along the harbors of Sydney. Thus the quest of Marlin, along with Dory (a hilarious forgetful blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) to find Nemo before it's too late.The story is a simple one but where the film more than makes up is on the overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colors and textures as if we aren't really watching an animated film at all. Scenes such as Marlin bringing Nemo to school while swimming through corals and anemones, to the aquarium where Nemo was taken to, are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtedbly one of the most outstanding animation ever to hit the screen.The world of ""Finding Nemo"" is simply alive with lovable creatures swimming about their daily lives under the ocean, darting across the screen in playful manners. The viewer almost literally dives into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely captivated. The music and screenplay also blend very well with the visual feast that it produces such a high quality movie. From its basic storyline, to the father-and-son relationship theme, to the wonderful underwater world throughout, this is really an adventure through an ocean of stunning visuals and storytelling.Grade: A",quite catch,pixar studios have done it again i have say that these guys are totally good computer animation as well as storytelling rarely do those qualities come together but here they are delivering unto audience once again something that one can only be drowned with wonder such is marvel finding nemo story is about nemo voiced by alexander gould young clownfish who is fed up with his dad marlins albert brooks excessive paranoia over him he swims place where his dad forbids him ends up being captured by scuba diver he is then placed fish tank dental clinic somewhere along harbors sydney thus quest marlin along with dory hilarious forgetful blue tang voiced by ellen degeneres find nemo before its too late story is simple one but where film more than makes up is overwhelming sense detail rich lavish colors textures as if we arent really watching animated film at all scenes such as marlin bringing nemo school while swimming through corals anemones aquarium where nemo was taken are nothing short breathtaking undoubtedbly one most outstanding animation ever hit screen world finding nemo is simply alive with lovable creatures swimming about their daily lives under ocean darting across screen playful manners viewer almost literally dives into another world nearly two hours one cannot help but be completely captivated music screenplay also blend very well with visual feast that it produces such high quality movie its basic storyline father son relationship theme wonderful underwater world throughout this is really adventure through ocean stunning visuals storytelling grade,0.5278571428571428,0.2142647058823529,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,What an outstanding movie!,"This movie is just gorgeous to look at, really the animation is just stunning, with the blue backgrounds and colourful characters. My only criticism is that although there are some very funny moments, like Doreen speaking whale(Ellen DeGeneres was born to speak whale, really she was) and Barry Humphries's shark, I don't think it is as laugh-out loud funny as Toy Story. Finding Nemo is definitely the most beautiful visually of the Pixar movies, I would certainly pick it over Cars. The music by Thomas Newman was just beautiful, and I always look out for this in a movie, and it was a delight hearing ""Beyond the Sea"" over the end credits. The characters are genuinely memorable, especially Doreen and Bruce. And who can forget the girl Darla, with the Psycho music?(that is really terrifying)The voice talents are very good indeed, especially Ellen DeGeneres, and I liked Willem Dafoe's Gil. Albert Brooks made a wonderfully paranoid father figure, and I loved the plot about Marlin's son Nemo being taken by divers and Marlin (a clown fish) racing to find him. That is simple, but we meet characters like the turtle, so the film is filled with fun, enough to satisfy the fussiest child. In conclusion, 9/10 for the visuals and the characters. Outstanding!

10.0,Just keep swimming...,"Can Pixar and Disney miss with a film? Both Toy Story's, A Bugs Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. These movies are instant classics.The movie in focus is Finding Nemo, a story of a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to find his son Nemo who was taken away by scuba divers. With the help of a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres)Marlin bumps into on his journey, they set out on finding Nemo. The only problem is that Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She can't remember anything except her name. It's sad but brings a lot of comedy to the movie.Along the way they meet some priceless characters like Crush (voiced by writer/director Andrew Stanton), the thrill seeking sea turtle. They also encounter a trio of friendly sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. They have sworn to never eat a fish again. They also run into some potentially deadly situations with an ugly deep sea fish, also a huge swarm of jellyfish, and a whale. Marlin and Dory must tough it out and make it to find Nemo.Meanwhile, Nemo is now the new addition to an Australian dentist's office aquarium. There he meets some interesting characters. Peach the starfish, Bloat the blowfish, and more sea dwellers. There Nemo tries to fit in, becoming a member of the tank named ""Shark Bait"". He tries to help out Gill (William Defoe) with his plan to escape from the tank and get everyone out. Nemo must come through in order to see his father ever again. A local pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) also tries to help out in the escape. Word has spread around the world of Marlin's trip to find his son, reaching Nigel.FInding Nemo is an instant classic. With great lines and unforgettable characters, this movie is a delight. The animation itself is remarkable. It's as though the fish are really swimming. You can even see particles floating in the water. Light shines through and currents make the fish and surrounding react.

,Space,"Spoilers herein.Steve Jobs drags us all into higher awareness. He does so by grabbing our attention by conventional means but does his real work subliminally.In the computer world, what we see is a coherent, accessible approach with appealing style. In the movie world we see the same, except the art of excellent character development and storytelling is substituted for sheer functionality and ease of creativity. In both, we all are pulled by this tractor into a more refined space.And space is what it is all about, in particular a notion of location in space coupled with a higher degree of freedom within that space.This has been a concern of intelligent filmmakers all along. Griffith merged the theatrical space with grand vistas of mass movement and did so from a spot no human would normally have. Welles and Kurosawa played with this, the first by working with architecture, the other by flattening in deep focus. But until the eighties we always had to deal with the reality of the ground -- and the horizon.The real appeal of ""Star Wars"" wasn't the cowboy story or guns, nor the pseudo-religious trappings, though we all thought it was. It was the freedom from that hard bottom, the Earth which we interact with in as consistently as breath and blood. ""Star Wars"" -- and ""2001"" before -- gave a thrill because our visual vocabulary was now expanded spatially rather than ALWAYS being referenced to the floor.Pixar's work has always been cognizant of this new frontier even when owned by Lucas. Under Jobs, every film has become more and more dimensional until now. We don't honk around with the camera as much as I would like, but we do set a new standard for interacting space. Naturally, all else is well crafted but serves this notion of space ? especially the fishtank business.Ted?s Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",space,spoilers herein steve jobs drags us all into higher awareness he does so by grabbing our attention by conventional means but does his real work subliminally computer world what we see is coherent accessible approach with appealing style movie world we see same except art excellent character development storytelling is substituted sheer functionality ease creativity both we all are pulled by this tractor into more refined space space is what it is all about particular notion location space coupled with higher degree freedom within that space this has been concern intelligent filmmakers all along griffith merged theatrical space with grand vistas mass movement did so spot no human would normally have welles kurosawa played with this first by working with architecture other by flattening deep focus but until eighties we always had deal with reality ground horizon real appeal star wars wasnt cowboy story or guns nor pseudo religious trappings though we all thought it was it was freedom that hard bottom earth which we interact with as consistently as breath blood star wars 2001 before gave thrill because our visual vocabulary was now expanded spatially rather than always being referenced floor pixars work has always been cognizant this new frontier even when owned by lucas under jobs every film has become more more dimensional until now we dont honk around with camera as much as i would like but we do set new standard interacting space naturally all else is well crafted but serves this notion space especially fishtank business ted s evaluation 3 4 worth watching,0.43086962057550293,0.2119079449961803,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.55}"

,The now-traditional mix of adult wit and kiddie laughs  although less sharp than usual (but still very funny),"Scarred by the loss of his wife and eggs, Marlin has over sheltered his only child, Nemo. However when Nemo's first day at school comes about, that mothering leads Nemo to swim out to the open ocean where he is caught by a scuba diver and be put in a fish tank far away. Enlisting help from the forgetful Dory, Marlin tracks the boat and his ocean adventure begins.Now as much as a tradition as national holidays, the latest Pixar animation arrives in the UK on a wave (d'oh!) of hype and marketing. Officially the biggest summer film in the US and all over buses and Happy Meals (which seems a little perverse when you think about it) it is hard not to want to see it or prevent your kids from demanding they see it. Happily the well establish benchmark of being kiddie friendly but fun for adults is maintained and the film does exactly what you know it will. The plot is a little like Toy Story's quest but is fleshed out enough to be interesting and the themes of `letting go' and loss are actually quite well handled and will speak more to adults than kids.The slight problem with the film is that is does do just what you expect and the `animated film with adult wit and kiddie characters' stuff is hardly cutting edge anymore. However this is a picky flaw as it is still very good fun. It may not be the strongest of this genre, indeed some bits flag and the sentimental core, while a break from cruel humour or sarcasm, does then to slow things down a bit at times.The adult references are all good but not as frequent as I'd have liked  they seem to be separate from the main flow where I wanted them integral with all of it. Clever homage's to Jaws (Bruce was the pet name of the rubber shark) and The Birds are distracting and make you feel good about yourself, and the banter is mostly witty if lacking a real sharpness at times.The voice cast are all good are quite an all star bunch. Brooks does a workmanlike job in the lead  it must be said I didn't think he distinguished himself but then he did have to carry the moral weight of the film. DeGeneres is much better and her dippy character is a delight at times. The support cast is not as deep and fun as in other films  Janney and Dafoe are both fun in the tank (as are all the tank characters) it's just that none of them are really consistent. My favourite characters were the one word seagulls  `mine?'Overall I have been unfair to this film in my review. If I saw this in isolation I would be praising it to the roof, however using the others as a benchmark this does have a few weaknesses that show signs of wear and tear in the genre. Not to cancel everything I have said, these weaknesses are all things that I realised after I had watched it  while I was watching it I was too busy laughing!

10.0,The little fish movie that could.,"My Take: Simply magical, down to the last computer-animated detail. I was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out, and only now am I reviewing it. But that can't stop me, I have to lay out my sentiments for this clever and occasionally brilliant animated achievement. Not only is it the best, so far, in Pixar's portfolio of animated films, it's one of the very best animated films ever made, period. FINDING NEMO is a well-told fairy tale adventure, but a well-told story is only a bonus compared to the film's awesome look and feel. The movie is visually stunning, with images that flow like living paintings, some of which almost but leaps out the screen. The movie is beautifully crafted, and sometimes, I almost didn't care about anything else. Almost.On the contrary, the story is quite simple. After a tragedy introduced in the opening scenes, Marlin the clown fish (voiced by Albert Brooks) becomes too over-protective of his last son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). Every move he makes is always under the watchful eye of his over-protective father, who couldn't afford to lose him. To prove that he can walk with his own two feet (or is that swim with his own fins?), Nemo approached an anchored divers boat and is abducted by two curious divers and taken far off the Great Barrier Reef. Marlin, guilty for his loss, is determined to find his son, captured by a dentist and placed inside a too-small-for-a-fish aquarium in the dentist's clinic. Along his side is a joyous yet forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who gives a helping fin a long the way, whatever she can remember.This is quite an adventure too. Not only are we introduced to a closer-than-life-like reef, we are also introduced with a clever and elaborate band of characters, including a trio of sharks who swore their lives to be vegetarians (until the call of the wild kicks in), a couple of surfer-dude turtles, a charade-playing school of fish and many other wonders. The animation here is, by far, the most brilliant ones I have ever seen. A colorful and life-filled reef, a forest of jellyfish and a crystal-clear aquarium filled of plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine in this lavish and elaborate adventure. But other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough to recommend the picture, the film is not without a good story, and it is told well. The characters have a great deal of features and characteristics. This is most evident on the character of Dory, who not only has the showmanship of the voice who dubbed her, but also the delight we expect from a true family film.If the story may not apply to you, or you might find it cliché, then FINDING NEMO will still do as a brilliant eye-candy, with one of the best sights I have ever seen in an animated film then and now. Sometimes, sitting in front of a theater or even the small screen and just let the elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough to see a movie. Sometimes it's a movie like this one that reminds you the fun that going to movies are.Rating: ***** out of 5.",little fish movie that could,my take simply magical down last computer animated detail i was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out only now am i reviewing it but that cant stop me i have lay out my sentiments this clever occasionally brilliant animated achievement not only is it best so far pixars portfolio animated films its one very best animated films ever made period finding nemo is well told fairy tale adventure but well told story is only bonus compared films awesome look feel movie is visually stunning with images that flow like living paintings some which almost but leaps out screen movie is beautifully crafted sometimes i almost didnt care about anything else almost contrary story is quite simple after tragedy introduced opening scenes marlin clown fish voiced by albert brooks becomes too over protective his last son nemo voiced by alexander gould every move he makes is always under watchful eye his over protective father who couldnt afford lose him prove that he can walk with his own two feet or is that swim with his own fins nemo approached anchored divers boat is abducted by two curious divers taken far off great barrier reef marlin guilty his loss is determined find his son captured by dentist placed inside too small fish aquarium dentists clinic along his side is joyous yet forgetful fish named dory voiced by ellen degeneres who gives helping fin long way whatever she can remember this is quite adventure too not only are we introduced closer than life like reef we are also introduced with clever elaborate band characters including trio sharks who swore their lives be vegetarians until call wild kicks couple surfer dude turtles charade playing school fish many other wonders animation here is by far most brilliant ones i have ever seen colorful life filled reef forest jellyfish crystal clear aquarium filled plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine this lavish elaborate adventure but other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough recommend picture film is not without good story it is told well characters have great deal features characteristics this is most evident character dory who not only has showmanship voice who dubbed her but also delight we expect true family film if story may not apply you or you might find it clich then finding nemo will still do as brilliant eye candy with one best sights i have ever seen animated film then now sometimes sitting front theater or even small screen just let elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough see movie sometimes its movie like this one that reminds you fun that going movies are rating out 5,0.6648373666406451,0.2971474108769191,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.44}"

10.0,Pixar has yet to top this movie.,"Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after.",pixar has yet top this movie,long have i loved this movie this is story lovable yet over protective clown fish his son marlon nemo respectively first day school nemo is taken off reef by dentist sydney marlon sets out rescue his son way he quite literally runs into blue dart named dory dory has disorder where she can not retain short term memories two set out together hilarity ensues this is disney owned movie so course there are some touching moments as well as happy ending but substance movie is phenomenal detail animators put into it is fantastic they also manage squeeze some easter eggs not all them are pixar disney related great white shark is named bruce which was nickname given animatronic shark jaws me there is no better film realm animation out there before or after,0.49888888888888894,0.31,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8.0,"Thoroughly enjoyable, but the sum does not equal the parts.","Fresh off a viewing in a packed theater of kids and parents, my initial impression of ""Finding Nemo"" was that I had a great time throughout, but don't necessarily remember why. The film is similar to the ""Toy Story"" pacing, in that we follow two different protagonists in their attempt to return to one another. In brief summary, Marlin the overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear of open ocean to try and find his only son, Nemo, who has been captured by a diver and transplanted to an ocean-view dentist's office fish tank.The visual impact of ""Finding Nemo"" is unparalleled in animated film. At its best, it compares to the experience of seeing the sweeping landscapes of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" for the first time - not until we own the DVD and my son has watched it a dozen times will I really have an opportunity to see the details crammed into the lush backgrounds of the coral reefs. It was noticeable, however, that frequent close-ups in open water were used to reduce the amount of time spent rendering those brilliant backgrounds. In comparison to Pixar films like ""A Bug's Life"", where every moment of the film includes rich textures and detailed background perspective, this seemed jarring at times. It should be noted that this is true to what the ocean looks like - if you're not diving in a coral reef, you are probably seeing a lot of floating detritus and gray water - but it's worth mentioning that the fish tank environment of Nemo and his fellow captives is, at times, more interesting than the open ocean.Pixar took chances (or else saved money) with many of the voice actors used in the film. It was refreshing not to instantly ""know"" a voice was familiar in the case of many of the characters - all of them did a serviceable job, although the well-known actors also turned in some of the best performances. Ellen DeGeneres had no fear as the voice of Dory, gleefully pulling off vocal pratfalls that would have been hampered by someone else's sense of dignity. I can think of only one other actress - Julia Louis-Dreyfuss - who I think would have been able to do Dory well. Kudos to Ellen. Willem Dafoe is also noticeably brilliant as Gill, and it's a bonus that the animated character he plays is gorgeously realized. John Ratzenberger does a hysterical turn as the school of fish we all saw in the previews.I am surprised at the number of characters whose voices are not credited in this film. I wanted to know, among others, who voiced Mr. Ray the schoolteacher and the trio of parents with whom Marlin banters.I laughed out loud frequently and heartily throughout the film, but at the end, I looked back and wondered how those moments of amusement added to the story. Many people have commented that they loved the 12-step program for sharks (""Fish are our friends, not food!"") but in the final analysis, it added very little to the arc and seemed out of character (I realize I'm stating the obvious). The frequently-dropped comedic digressions were the weak point in this picture, especially compared to ""A Bug's Life"", where the funniest moments of the film are all critical to the progress of the protagonist and impact the end of the story.My 2 and a half year old son was frequently frightened to the point of crying out and grabbing on to me during the movie, and he followed the primary issues easily. At a particular moment in the film when things seemed hopeless, I heard dozens of young children beginning to cry. If your child is very affected by scary or dramatic moments in movies, you may want to talk with them about ""pretend"" versus ""real"" and prepare them for the eventuality that everything will turn out all right well before you go into the theater. His final analysis was that ""the fish movie was good!"" - so take it under advisement if you have kids of similar age.I give ""Finding Nemo"" an 8 out of 10 on the strength of its visual lushness, its enjoyable voice work, and its moments of perfectly timed humor. It does not, in my opinion, match the strength as a *film* of earlier Pixar offerings, but even in its innocuous state, it's higher quality than most of the family films I've seen in the past 3 years.",thoroughly enjoyable but sum does not equal parts,fresh off viewing packed theater kids parents my initial impression finding nemo was that i had great time throughout but dont necessarily remember why film is similar toy story pacing that we follow two different protagonists their attempt return one another brief summary marlin overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear open ocean try find his only son nemo who has been captured by diver transplanted ocean view dentists office fish tank visual impact finding nemo is unparalleled animated film at its best it compares experience seeing sweeping landscapes fellowship ring first time not until we own dvd my son has watched it dozen times will i really have opportunity see details crammed into lush backgrounds coral reefs it was noticeable however that frequent close ups open water were used reduce amount time spent rendering those brilliant backgrounds comparison pixar films like bugs life where every moment film includes rich textures detailed background perspective this seemed jarring at times it should be noted that this is true what ocean looks like if youre not diving coral reef you are probably seeing lot floating detritus gray water but its worth mentioning that fish tank environment nemo his fellow captives is at times more interesting than open ocean pixar took chances or else saved money with many voice actors used film it was refreshing not instantly know voice was familiar case many characters all them did serviceable job although well known actors also turned some best performances ellen degeneres had no fear as voice dory gleefully pulling off vocal pratfalls that would have been hampered by someone elses sense dignity i can think only one other actress julia louis dreyfuss who i think would have been able do dory well kudos ellen willem dafoe is also noticeably brilliant as gill its bonus that animated character he plays is gorgeously realized john ratzenberger does hysterical turn as school fish we all saw previews i am surprised at number characters whose voices are not credited this film i wanted know among others who voiced mr ray schoolteacher trio parents with whom marlin banters i laughed out loud frequently heartily throughout film but at end i looked back wondered how those moments amusement added story many people have commented that they loved 12 step program sharks fish are our friends not food but final analysis it added very little arc seemed out character i realize im stating obvious frequently dropped comedic digressions were weak point this picture especially compared bugs life where funniest moments film are all critical progress protagonist impact end story my 2 half year old son was frequently frightened point crying out grabbing me during movie he followed primary issues easily at particular moment film when things seemed hopeless i heard dozens young children beginning cry if your child is very affected by scary or dramatic moments movies you may want talk with them about pretend versus real prepare them eventuality that everything will turn out all right well before you go into theater his final analysis was that fish movie was good so take it under advisement if you have kids similar age i give finding nemo 8 out 10 strength its visual lushness its enjoyable voice work its moments perfectly timed humor it does not my opinion match strength as film earlier pixar offerings but even its innocuous state its higher quality than most family films ive seen past 3 years,0.5460265924551638,0.20985235003092137,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.48}"
9.0,"There are 3.7 trillion fish in the ocean, and they're looking for one.","''Finding Nemo'' is one of the sweetest movies I have watched this days. Produced by the both powerful Disney and Pixar with amazing graphics and a nice story, I am not surprised that this movie won the Oscar.In the Ocean, we see Marlin and Coral, a couple of clown fish that are very happy to have kids. But when both Marlin and Coral needs to hide from their predator, Coral stays so worried with the eggs that runs out of their shelter to save them. But the worst happens, and Coral and the eggs are all consumed by the predator. Marlin is devastate, when he sees one little egg that wasn't taken away. He decides to call him 'Nemo'and take care very well of the only son that lasted. Time passes, and Nemo needs to go to school and do other stuff, but his father is always forbidding him because of his trauma with Coral and the other sons. When Marlin finally let Nemo go to the school, he is captured by a scuba diver and taken to live in a dentist office's fish tank. Decided to take his son back, Marlin will find other animals that are very funny and different, like Dory, who is always forgetting things, vegetarian sharks and turtles who are surfers.",there are 3 7 trillion fish ocean theyre looking one,finding nemo is one sweetest movies i have watched this days produced by both powerful disney pixar with amazing graphics nice story i am not surprised that this movie won oscar ocean we see marlin coral couple clown fish that are very happy have kids but when both marlin coral needs hide their predator coral stays so worried with eggs that runs out their shelter save them but worst happens coral eggs are all consumed by predator marlin is devastate when he sees one little egg that wasnt taken away he decides call him nemoand take care very well only son that lasted time passes nemo needs go school do other stuff but his father is always forbidding him because his trauma with coral other sons when marlin finally let nemo go school he is captured by scuba diver taken live dentist offices fish tank decided take his son back marlin will find other animals that are very funny different like dory who is always forgetting things vegetarian sharks turtles who are surfers,0.6955882352941176,0.09110962566844921,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.21}"
