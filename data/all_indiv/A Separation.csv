9.0,Do yourself a favor - make sure you see this movie,"Caught ""A Separation"" in Amsterdam last night, fully unprepared for its greatness. I hadn't been swept off my feet for a while, but this Iranian Hitchcockian drama sucked us in for 123 minutes and left us very, very impressed.I'm mainly writing this review to assure every non-Iranian IMDb-reader that you absolutely SHOULD see ""A Separation"". I will be shocked if this movie doesn't win an Academy Award. The acting is great, and the script is probably the best I've seen in five years. The genius of Asghar Farhadi's story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. Very few screenwriters have this capacity.If this movie reminds me of anything, it is ""Ladri di Biciclette"" (Bicycle Thieves), which has a similar seemingly ""simple"" story setup. But then ""A Separation"" is much more developed, much more complex, much richer. Go see it.",do yourself favor make sure you see this movie,caught separation amsterdam last night fully unprepared its greatness i hadnt been swept off my feet while but this iranian hitchcockian drama sucked us 123 minutes left us very very impressed im mainly writing this review assure every non iranian imdb reader that you absolutely should see separation i will be shocked if this movie doesnt win academy award acting is great script is probably best ive seen five years genius asghar farhadis story is that it piles tension drama without resorting fireworks trickery or shock awe plot effects it also manages perfectly balance plights several protagonists very few screenwriters have this capacity if this movie reminds me anything it is ladri di biciclette bicycle thieves which has similar seemingly simple story setup but then separation is much more developed much more complex much richer go see it,0.43933484504913073,0.26222222222222225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,Mankind Is Flawed,"In Tehran, the teacher Simin (Leila Hatami) has requested the divorce from her husband, the bank clerk Nader (Peyman Moadi). Simin wishes to live abroad to give a better life to her eleven year-old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi) and Nader, who is a family man but very arrogant, wants to stay to take care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) that has Alzheimer. Simin moves to the house of her mother and Nader hires the religious Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he is working. Razieh is pregnant but she does not tell her husband Hodjat (Shahab Hosseini), who owes a large amount to the creditors, that she is working. When she arrives with her daughter Somayeh (Kimia Hosseini)at Nader's house, she distracts and Nader's father goes to the street and she goes and gets him back home. On the next day, when Nader arrives home with Termeh, they find Nader's father tied up to his bed and Razieh and Somayeh are not at home. When they arrive at home, Nader accuses Razieh of theft and expels her. Razieh feels offended and argues with him, and Nader pushes her out at the front door. Razieh falls and has an abortion. She goes to the court with her husband and the witnesses are summoned to testify. ""Jodaeiye Nader az Simin"" or the separation of Nader and Simin, is among the best Iranian films I have seen and is a fantastic drama that shows how flawed mankind is, no matter in Iran, Brazil, Europe or wherever. Despite the different values of the Iranian society comparing with the Westerns ones, all the characters are flawed; therefore, the plot is realistic. Nader is a family man that loves his father and his daughter, but commits perjury, is stubborn and arrogant and asks his acquaintances to lie. Simin uses the secret that Razieh had told her to take advantage. Termeh lies to save her father from justice. Razieh is religious and worried with Allah and sins, but she was capable to lie fearing the reaction of her husband. Hodjat is a rude and impulsive man that is violent. The direction is perfect and the acting is top-notch. The story is engaging and believable and differences of cultures between Iran and Brazil are intriguing. I really recommend this film for any cinema lover or people interested in learning a little about the Iranian culture. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Separação"" (""The Separation"")",mankind is flawed,tehran teacher simin leila hatami has requested divorce her husband bank clerk nader peyman moadi simin wishes live abroad give better life her eleven year old daughter termeh sarina farhadi nader who is family man but very arrogant wants stay take care his father ali asghar shahbazi that has alzheimer simin moves house her mother nader hires religious razieh sareh bayat take care his father while he is working razieh is pregnant but she does not tell her husband hodjat shahab hosseini who owes large amount creditors that she is working when she arrives with her daughter somayeh kimia hosseini at naders house she distracts naders father goes street she goes gets him back home next day when nader arrives home with termeh they find naders father tied up his bed razieh somayeh are not at home when they arrive at home nader accuses razieh theft expels her razieh feels offended argues with him nader pushes her out at front door razieh falls has abortion she goes court with her husband witnesses are summoned testify jodaeiye nader az simin or separation nader simin is among best iranian films i have seen is fantastic drama that shows how flawed mankind is no matter iran brazil europe or wherever despite different values iranian society comparing with westerns ones all characters are flawed therefore plot is realistic nader is family man that loves his father his daughter but commits perjury is stubborn arrogant asks his acquaintances lie simin uses secret that razieh had told her take advantage termeh lies save her father justice razieh is religious worried with allah sins but she was capable lie fearing reaction her husband hodjat is rude impulsive man that is violent direction is perfect acting is top notch story is engaging believable differences cultures between iran brazil are intriguing i really recommend this film any cinema lover or people interested learning little about iranian culture my vote is ten title brazil separa o separation,0.4269345238095238,0.10666091720779222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9.0,Maybe the movie of the year,"And it comes from Iran. The first thing you read on the screen is ""In the name of God"". Well, anyway it's the best story, the best cutting, the best actors you've seen for long. And few films are that stomach-turning, although there's hardly any physical violence.A wife wants to go abroad. Her husband can't because he wants to take of his senile father. The wife moves and the husband hires a woman to look after his father.And then the screw turns, although most of the story takes place in everyday Iranian life. The center of it all is perhaps the daughter, who is nearly teared apart. But it takes time until you realize that.

10.0,The Swan Song of Iranian cinema?,"Asghar Farhadi's new film after the ingenious 'About Elly' is running for the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival and, with half of the competition done and the rest of the program not looking too promising, appears to be an almost inevitable winner. Although maybe it won't for that very reason: Jahar Panahi's repeat inability to attend his jury duties because of Iran's government refusal to issue him a travel permit, a retrospective of his works including the 2006 Silver Bear-winning 'Offside', a variety of other Iranian productions and renewed demonstrations in Iran proper put the spotlight firmly on that country's elaborate, yet constrained film industry. All that buzz may outshine the film's artistic value, and prompt the jury to go for a less favored competitor. I should hope not, for Farhadi manages once again to embed lots of social criticism into a straight-laced, realistic narrative.As in 'About Elly', the story begins rather unassumingly and takes an abrupt turn into a spiral of increasingly dramatic events: Nader and Simin are a couple about to break up over the question of moving abroad, for which they have obtained a permit after waiting for 18 months. Nader, however, has his father to take care of, who is suffering from Alzheimer's. Sirin still wants to leave, but not without her daughter (yes, pun intended) Termeh, a somewhat shy, bespectacled 11-year-old who cannot accept her parents' break-up. She therefore decides to stay with her father, which prompts Simin not to leave the country, but move to her mother. Nader is thereby forced to hire someone to take care of his dad, and a colleague of Sirin recommends the pregnant Razieh. Being deeply religious, she should not work in a single man's household, but her husband has been out of a job for a long time and is threatened with jail by his creditors. Her pregnancy and the necessity to attend to her daughter additionally stress her out. When Nader comes home one day to find his father left alone and tied to his bed, a struggle with the returning Razieh ensues, with catastrophic consequences for everyone around...This is a much more complicated set-up than in 'About Elly', but it allows Farhadi to put a lot of additional information into his film as may be obvious to those who are just trying to follow the story (I hesitate to give examples because the film is as of yet to be released in Iran, which means an open-source comment such as this one needs to be carefully phrased). Much of the action takes place in courtrooms, where judges try to negotiate between the parties without any lawyers present. There's a lot of familiarity, and also a lot of menace, which succeeds to create the same climate of anxiety, accusation and deceit as in 'About Elly'. The realism of the narrative is embedded into a carefully planned scenography which makes almost every shot linger in the memory. And as in 'About Elly' the decisive moment, the one that solves the mystery is omitted in the picture, only to be explained verbally at the very end.What makes me feel even more for this film is the fact that it might be the last film of its kind from Iran for some time. Ali Samadi Ahadi, the German-Iranian director of the comedy 'Salami Aleikum' and the upcoming documentary on the July 2009 protests 'The Green Wave', wrote that the film industry has come to a virtual standstill. 'Nader and Simin' was in development at the time of the protests; since then, regulations have become far more repressive, with even established masters like Kiarostami or Makhmalbaf forced to work abroad, and others threatened with jail and work prohibitions, of whom Panahi is only the most famous example. All the more reason to give this film the credit it deserves - winning Berlin may cause Iran's bureaucrats to reconsider, for cinema is almost the last link remaining to our world. Without film, how could we understand that Iranians are a modern people with issues like our own, and not dangerous fanatics as some media and politicians would have us believe?",swan song iranian cinema,asghar farhadis new film after ingenious about elly is running golden bear at this years berlin film festival with half competition done rest program not looking too promising appears be almost inevitable winner although maybe it wont that very reason jahar panahis repeat inability attend his jury duties because irans government refusal issue him travel permit retrospective his works including 2006 silver bear winning offside variety other iranian productions renewed demonstrations iran proper put spotlight firmly that countrys elaborate yet constrained film industry all that buzz may outshine films artistic value prompt jury go less favored competitor i should hope not farhadi manages once again embed lots social criticism into straight laced realistic narrative as about elly story begins rather unassumingly takes abrupt turn into spiral increasingly dramatic events nader simin are couple about break up over question moving abroad which they have obtained permit after waiting 18 months nader however has his father take care who is suffering alzheimers sirin still wants leave but not without her daughter yes pun intended termeh somewhat shy bespectacled 11 year old who cannot accept her parents break up she therefore decides stay with her father which prompts simin not leave country but move her mother nader is thereby forced hire someone take care his dad colleague sirin recommends pregnant razieh being deeply religious she should not work single mans household but her husband has been out job long time is threatened with jail by his creditors her pregnancy necessity attend her daughter additionally stress her out when nader comes home one day find his father left alone tied his bed struggle with returning razieh ensues with catastrophic consequences everyone around this is much more complicated set up than about elly but it allows farhadi put lot additional information into his film as may be obvious those who are just trying follow story i hesitate give examples because film is as yet be released iran which means open source comment such as this one needs be carefully phrased much action takes place courtrooms where judges try negotiate between parties without any lawyers present theres lot familiarity also lot menace which succeeds create same climate anxiety accusation deceit as about elly realism narrative is embedded into carefully planned scenography which makes almost every shot linger memory as about elly decisive moment one that solves mystery is omitted picture only be explained verbally at very end what makes me feel even more this film is fact that it might be last film its kind iran some time ali samadi ahadi german iranian director comedy salami aleikum upcoming documentary july 2009 protests green wave wrote that film industry has come virtual standstill nader simin was development at time protests since then regulations have become far more repressive with even established masters like kiarostami or makhmalbaf forced work abroad others threatened with jail work prohibitions whom panahi is only most famous example all more reason give this film credit it deserves winning berlin may cause irans bureaucrats reconsider cinema is almost last link remaining our world without film how could we understand that iranians are modern people with issues like our own not dangerous fanatics as some media politicians would have us believe,0.4739596425080296,0.11717637201508169,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.52}"
10.0,Wow! Just.. wow!,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --Wow! I didn't have any expectation and that's what probably helped but A SEPARATION is a great drama. Foreign language film or not, this is just an excellent, excellent drama. You can't get a more Oscar worthy material than this. To me what makes A SEPARATION unique is that writer/director Asghar Farhadi takes conflict, secrets, relationships and other elements that we're familiar with and mixes them with the culture, religion and gender elements from that specific region. This film, to a certain extent, lets you in on how the justice system works in a place where some of us may be ignorant about. And it's really not about our way is better than theirs or vice versa, it's just how different some things are doneAnd this is not just about a divorce or a separation of two individuals The film starts out that way and it ends on that note as well but what happens in between is more of a spin-off story or it stems from when the lead characters Nader and Simin stop being on the same page. A SEPARATION is a very dialogue-driven, a very character driven story, all the actors in this film are marvelous. When the tension is high, they're extremely convincing, I couldn't take my eyes off any of them, especially lead actress Leila Hatami who holds a certain photogenic beauty.On one spectrum, you have Nader and Simin with their daughter, on the other end of the spectrum you have Hodjat and Razieh with their little adorable daughter. Because Simin takes time off from her marriage with the intent to divorce her husband, Nader has to hire Razieh to take care of his father who suffers from Alzheimer's. An incident occurs that escalates into a courtroom drama but there is actually another incident or a card that Asghar Farhadi hides until it's time to show it further on in the story and the way everything progresses and eventually unravels keeps you intrigued. A big part of what draws me in is the film's depiction of Iranian law and traditions when it comes to divorces and allegations. What may be considered murder, how important it is for an individual to see someone swear on a Koran, how a judge deals with opposing alibis. I don't know how accurate it is but it's nothing short of interesting. It would certainly cause debate and discussion among the audiences as to the fairness of it all. And the story goes through those problems and makes a full round circle back to the separation of Simin from Nader. A highly engrossing film.-- www.Ramascreen.com --",wow just wow,www ramascreen com wow i didnt have any expectation thats what probably helped but separation is great drama foreign language film or not this is just excellent excellent drama you cant get more oscar worthy material than this me what makes separation unique is that writer director asghar farhadi takes conflict secrets relationships other elements that were familiar with mixes them with culture religion gender elements that specific region this film certain extent lets you how justice system works place where some us may be ignorant about its really not about our way is better than theirs or vice versa its just how different some things are done this is not just about divorce or separation two individuals film starts out that way it ends that note as well but what happens between is more spin off story or it stems when lead characters nader simin stop being same page separation is very dialogue driven very character driven story all actors this film are marvelous when tension is high theyre extremely convincing i couldnt take my eyes off any them especially lead actress leila hatami who holds certain photogenic beauty one spectrum you have nader simin with their daughter other end spectrum you have hodjat razieh with their little adorable daughter because simin takes time off her marriage with intent divorce her husband nader has hire razieh take care his father who suffers alzheimers incident occurs that escalates into courtroom drama but there is actually another incident or card that asghar farhadi hides until its time show it further story way everything progresses eventually unravels keeps you intrigued big part what draws me is films depiction iranian law traditions when it comes divorces allegations what may be considered murder how important it is individual see someone swear koran how judge deals with opposing alibis i dont know how accurate it is but its nothing short interesting it would certainly cause debate discussion among audiences as fairness it all story goes through those problems makes full round circle back separation simin nader highly engrossing film www ramascreen com,0.5793632336655593,0.2249695459579181,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,A gripping and heart-pounding universal masterpiece ... made in Iran ...,"""A Separation"" is an intense and powerful examination of the eternal conflict between human emotions, personal convictions and Law, whether political or religious, and it happens to be –I believe- the best film of 2011.The movie is set in Iran, in an upper-middle class area, and features a series of unfortunate incidents, all guided by sincere and genuine emotions, but that nonetheless end up judged by the Islamic Law. Written and directed by Ashgar Farhadi, the film is a triumph on the field of intelligence as it never patronizes the viewer by pointing a finger on an obvious 'antagonist'. Ultimately, the victims are not innocent, nor the accusers are wrongdoers, and the only 'responsible' is a Law that fails to take into consideration human feelings.Still, Law isn't negatively portrayed as it remains true to its obligatory neutrality, a notion hinted in the very first scene of the film. Indeed, the realism and intensity of the dialog, a back and forth verbal fight between a wife and a husband sets in the very first minutes what would be the enthralling tone of the film. The core of the conflict is not unusual in family dramas, it's about a child custody, Simin (Leila Hatami) wants a divorce because her husband Nader (Peyman Moadi) refuse to emigrate in a country that would –in her opinion- provide a better education to her daughter Termeh, Sarina Farhadi as a strong-minded adolescent yet the hostage of an inextricable situation, even more ironic because the two parents don't want to divorce.But Nader gives legitimate reasons to his refusal: he must take care of his father, an old eighty-something man suffering from Alzheimer disease. ""But he doesn't know you!"" ""Yes, but I know him"", this brilliant exchange plays like the movie in microcosm; it's all about contradictory opinions guided by legitimate emotions or convictions. When the opening scene ends, those who agree with Simin's arguments understand Nader and vice-versa. If there is ever one, that's the greatest achievement of Farhadi's Oscar-nominated screenplay; still, the force of the script enough couldn't have elevated ""A Separation"" to such a universal and miraculously unanimous acclaim. The film works as a perfect combination of writing, acting and directing to such an extent that it could have easily been nominated to more than two Oscars without garnering much surprise.Farhadi's direction is perfect for this kind of narrative as it uses a hand-held camera work in many scenes, as to create the dizzying and uncomfortable effect of documentary-like realism. The film reminds of Cassavetes' naturalistic work in the way it conveys a sort of one-set room intimacy and place the viewer in the unsettling situation of a witness, caught in the middle of a scene, I mean by 'scene' an embarrassing and uncomfortable situation. We just see and watch, and our hearts pound from these displays of aggressiveness, hostility, cries, shouts and thankfully sometimes, love and affection. Farhadi's film is a masterpiece of storytelling on that level, proving that even plain dramas can be as emotionally engaging as thrillers, and the film does it so well that the content can invite any audience to question its own legal system, no more or no less immune from similar issues.Law has been established by men in order to find the truth within the chaotic succession of facts that can speak for two opposite sides, but the genius of ""A Separation"" is that it deals with a particular situation where no one is aware of all the facts, even the viewer is left with some hints and clues, and can only assemble them as the movie progresses. Razieh (Sareh Beyat) is a young religious mother hired as a caregiver for Nader's father. She has a miscarriage and pretends it was caused by Nader's brutality. Nader claims he didn't know anything about the pregnancy and was upset because she left his father alone. The domino's effect introduces the peripheral characters as Simin wants to protect Termeh from Razieh's hot tempered full-of-debts husband Hodjat (Shahab Hossein) who vents his anger on the system, and through his scene-stealing performance paints an indirect social commentary on actual Iran.The film is full of confrontations that are some of the most realistic ever: everything in the dialogs and the acting sounds true and make the whole experience so nerve-wracking that we never know if we're embarrassed to see these lives being destroyed or because the script didn't let us determine which side we're supposed to take. But ""A Separation"" is beyond these sterile considerations: it's not about sides to take or opinions to make, it's about the innate limits of Law. Law is even incarnated by a decent judge who shows some signs of reason and magnanimousness sometimes, and sometimes can't handle Hodjat's outbursts of anger. In a way, he embodies our position as the powerless observer of a situation that goes out of control because it engages a wide range of emotions, sometimes positive, sometimes negative but always sincere, creative a psychological cocktail about to explode if a resolution doesn't come to appease the nerves.The resolution, or let's say, the conclusion, is satisfying because it never betrays the film's 'philosophy' and leaves us with the penetrating sensation that we've just watched a miracle, a modest creation whose emotional and intellectual force spoke some uncomfortable truths about human nature and its antagonism with Law's cold realism. And on the surface, it also features an Iran far from the current stereotypes launched by the infamous ""Not Without My Daughter"", where women aren't all submissive chador-wearers and men macho wife-beaters.(I feel terrible to pollute this review with these comments because they insult the intelligence of the film, which already takes for granted that 'Iranian are normal people' but

9.0,Iranian cinema lands in the west with a bang. Phenomenal.,"I've never seen an Iranian move but the country has a rich movie culture that has broken through with A Separation which won the Golden Bear, best actor and best actress awards at Berlin earlier this year. And I can understand why.Don't go expecting lavish cinematography, this is shot on hand held cameras, or certainly on fairly shaky tripods throughout, often under the harsh glare of fluorescent lighting that throws a watery blue cast over the action at times. But that is highly appropriate because this movie has a creeping sense of voyeurism throughout as the intensely private happenings of a family, and perhaps country, in turmoil steadily build up into a furious climax.The plot is complex to say the least, but one can keep up by fully concentrating on each twist and turn of this micro-thriller.The oppression of the Koran in this staunchly Muslim country carries a heavy burden throughout the film and it's the most frequently used prop as one of the characters in particular, the victim of a central crime, seeks spiritual guidance throughout. It's importance and oppression is palpable.The story concerns the vain attempts of a wife (superbly acted by Leila Hatami) to leave Tehran with her husband to improve the life of their 12 year old daughter. But the husband cannot force himself to leave his Alzheimer's afflicted father behind and so stalemate ensues and divorce becomes the only alternative, this results in a separation and so the father (played to perfection by Peyman Moaadi) is forced to hire a nurse to look after his desperately sad father during the day.One thing leads to another and inadvertently the husband pushes the nurse so that she ends up aborting her child.This sets off a horrendous chain of events that I will not reveal here for fear of spoiling it for you.Suffice to say the tension mounts throughout the movie and culminates in a heartbreaking decision for the couple's 12 year old daughter that is resolved in a way that Michael Hanneke would applaud vigorously.This movie deals with important themes of family loyalty (more than love), duty, the oppression and folly of religion and pride.Without overbearing pride much of the consequences of this film would not happen. Time and again you silently shout at the screen ""just do the right thing and this mess will be resolved."" They never do.It could almost be played for laughs so farcical are the the situations the main protagonists find themselves in. But this is no comedy, far from it. It's a tearjerker and feels bitterly real, believable and often futile.It's as good as its billing. See it.",iranian cinema lands west with bang phenomenal,ive never seen iranian move but country has rich movie culture that has broken through with separation which won golden bear best actor best actress awards at berlin earlier this year i can understand why dont go expecting lavish cinematography this is shot hand held cameras or certainly fairly shaky tripods throughout often under harsh glare fluorescent lighting that throws watery blue cast over action at times but that is highly appropriate because this movie has creeping sense voyeurism throughout as intensely private happenings family perhaps country turmoil steadily build up into furious climax plot is complex say least but one can keep up by fully concentrating each twist turn this micro thriller oppression koran this staunchly muslim country carries heavy burden throughout film its most frequently used prop as one characters particular victim central crime seeks spiritual guidance throughout its importance oppression is palpable story concerns vain attempts wife superbly acted by leila hatami leave tehran with her husband improve life their 12 year old daughter but husband cannot force himself leave his alzheimers afflicted father behind so stalemate ensues divorce becomes only alternative this results separation so father played perfection by peyman moaadi is forced hire nurse look after his desperately sad father during day one thing leads another inadvertently husband pushes nurse so that she ends up aborting her child this sets off horrendous chain events that i will not reveal here fear spoiling it you suffice say tension mounts throughout movie culminates heartbreaking decision couples 12 year old daughter that is resolved way that michael hanneke would applaud vigorously this movie deals with important themes family loyalty more than love duty oppression folly religion pride without overbearing pride much consequences this film would not happen time again you silently shout at screen just do right thing this mess will be resolved they never do it could almost be played laughs so farcical are situations main protagonists find themselves but this is no comedy far it its tearjerker feels bitterly real believable often futile its as good as its billing see it,0.4624584717607973,0.13784606866002214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,unsaid words can turn into a separation,"It seems that a court room drama could be the best place for Frahadi to recreate his very own world and confront us with a short and somehow faraway situations and incidents in life. We think these kinds of happenings and conflicts would not take place in our lives but with his realistic world and characters they seem so close and possible to anyone. Asghar Farhadi loves to put his audience in place of judge, as his other pictures like About Eli or Fireworks Wednesday and here with no fear he takes us straight to a court room. But the thing is that the judge does not provide any help for us to make a clear judgment and surprisingly makes the situation even more complicated. Yes Farhadi doesn't want us to make a judgment, He makes us watch and observe and leave the theater with a big fork in front of us.It Seems that any single decision creates another world full of forks and not taken ways.when nobody is clearly guilty and the line between black and white is so dim. And again here we are in Frhadi's powerful hands surprised to the end of the movie. You can't leave your chair even for one second because the story never lets you to lose even a single moment.

9.0,"While not especially pleasant viewing, it's a very complex film--the sort that will get you and your friends talking.","Over the years, I have watched perhaps thousands of international films. And, I've come to be impressed by the films of three countries--France, Japan and, surprisingly, Iran. In fact, although I've seen far fewer Iranian films than either Japanese or French, the Iranian films have always been exceptional...always. Their track record with films you can see here in the States is amazing. Part of it is because the nation has produced Majid Majidi--a truly brilliant filmmaker who, oddly, has only received on Oscar nomination and no wins. Yet, easily, he could have won several times with such brilliant films as ""Chidlren of Heaven"", ""The Color of Paradise"", ""The Willow Tree"" and ""Baran"". I have also seen several other wonderful film by other Iranian directors. So, I was quite interested in seeing ""A Separation"" when it arrived at a local theater. And, I am glad I had a chance to see it.The film begins with a man and wife both seeing a judge (or more like a referee) to discuss a divorce. The wife wants to leave Iran (exactly why is never discussed, by the way--an interesting omission) but the husband is adamant--he won't leave his father, as the father has Alzheimer's. This is an odd reason to want a divorce and as the audience knew nothing about the family, it was easy to dislike the wife and side with the husband--especially since they have a daughter who is in the middle. But the wife insists--she WILL leave whether he divorces her or not.Most of the rest of the film centers on the husband. You have to feel for the guy--his wife insists on leaving, his father is in the mid-late stages of the disease and he is having a devil of a time finding someone to care for the man. His prayers seem to be answered when he finds a woman willing to watch him--and at the price he can afford. However, this is early in the film and there is LOTS to come. I'd say more about the plot, but there are so many surprises, I'd rather just leave it to you to see yourself.n The film is great to watch because there are so many surprises and so many situations where people are faced with very tough choices and yet they seem to make the wrong ones again and again--all due to stubbornness. Such simple things like apologizing or even talking out problems--all these seem beyond people. And, in the process, two children from two separate families are stuck in the middle--with HUGE pressures put on them by their parents. As a result of all this, I can guarantee that it's a film that will get you thinking and have a strong emotional impact. It's also a great film to see with friends because I could easily see the film stimulating a ton of discussion afterwords. Intelligent and very complex--the only reservation I have is that the film is unrelentingly sad and tough to watch. I could imagine some viewers just tiring of all this, as it's like an extended Bickerson's skit--without any jokes or levity--just anger, horrible decisions, selfishness and isolation. Sad but profound.",while not especially pleasant viewing its very complex film sort that will get you your friends talking,over years i have watched perhaps thousands international films ive come be impressed by films three countries france japan surprisingly iran fact although ive seen far fewer iranian films than either japanese or french iranian films have always been exceptional always their track record with films you can see here states is amazing part it is because nation has produced majid majidi truly brilliant filmmaker who oddly has only received oscar nomination no wins yet easily he could have won several times with such brilliant films as chidlren heaven color paradise willow tree baran i have also seen several other wonderful film by other iranian directors so i was quite interested seeing separation when it arrived at local theater i am glad i had chance see it film begins with man wife both seeing judge or more like referee discuss divorce wife wants leave iran exactly why is never discussed by way interesting omission but husband is adamant he wont leave his father as father has alzheimers this is odd reason want divorce as audience knew nothing about family it was easy dislike wife side with husband especially since they have daughter who is middle but wife insists she will leave whether he divorces her or not most rest film centers husband you have feel guy his wife insists leaving his father is mid late stages disease he is having devil time finding someone care man his prayers seem be answered when he finds woman willing watch him at price he can afford however this is early film there is lots come id say more about plot but there are so many surprises id rather just leave it you see yourself n film is great watch because there are so many surprises so many situations where people are faced with very tough choices yet they seem make wrong ones again again all due stubbornness such simple things like apologizing or even talking out problems all these seem beyond people process two children two separate families are stuck middle with huge pressures put them by their parents as result all this i can guarantee that its film that will get you thinking have strong emotional impact its also great film see with friends because i could easily see film stimulating ton discussion afterwords intelligent very complex only reservation i have is that film is unrelentingly sad tough watch i could imagine some viewers just tiring all this as its like extended bickersons skit without any jokes or levity just anger horrible decisions selfishness isolation sad but profound,0.5769084821428572,0.13542534722222227,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.29}"
10.0,"thoughtful, brilliant film","This is the first Iranian film I've seen, and I'm recommending it to every-one I know. It is so well-crafted; the twists of the plot throw up new moral dilemmas for all the protagonists, which are explored sensitively and without judgement - so refreshingly unlike mainstream American films. I felt sympathy for all the characters, even the threatening Hodjat, full of misplaced rage which often erupts volcanically.

10.0,For me A Separation is definitely one of the best films of 2011,"Hearing how highly regarded A Separation was among my IMDb friends, I knew I had to see it. My only question is how on earth did it take so long for me to do so? I can only put it down to being behind with my film watching because of uni, because A Separation is a fantastic film and deserves all ounces of praise it gets and some. That is my opinion though, because I know people will find that it is not their cup of tea and have no problem with that. What was it I loved about A Separation? A lot of things actually. It was a very well made film. The scenery is striking and authentic, and the cinematography is intrusive and relentlessly, but this adds to the impact of the story rather than detracts from it. Asghar Farhadi's direction similarly is supremely controlled. A Separation is remarkably written as well. The writing is intelligent and insightful, avoiding any kind of melodrama or moralising. Not just that but it succeeds also in exploring the characters without any kind of prejudice, and that is including Hodjat. The story is quite a complicated set-up, but compelling and moving. It gives the audience time to breathe, but with the tension and drama that fuels what is happening in the storytelling I found myself never being able to look away. The characters are sensitively explored, and while I've not seen About Elly in a while I do remember that I didn't relate as much to the characters there than I did here. The acting is wonderful, Leila Hatami(especially good), Peyman Moadi, Shahab Hosseini and Sareh Bayat give performances that wholly justified the sharing of the Silver Berlin Bear. One mustn't forget Sarina Farhadi, whose increasing intensity in her acting is what makes A Separation's storytelling and the case it depicts even more engrossing. In conclusion, one of the best of 2011, considering how hit and miss that year was for films that's saying a bit. 10/10 Bethany Cox",me separation is definitely one best films 2011,hearing how highly regarded separation was among my imdb friends i knew i had see it my only question is how earth did it take so long me do so i can only put it down being behind with my film watching because uni because separation is fantastic film deserves all ounces praise it gets some that is my opinion though because i know people will find that it is not their cup tea have no problem with that what was it i loved about separation lot things actually it was very well made film scenery is striking authentic cinematography is intrusive relentlessly but this adds impact story rather than detracts it asghar farhadis direction similarly is supremely controlled separation is remarkably written as well writing is intelligent insightful avoiding any kind melodrama or moralising not just that but it succeeds also exploring characters without any kind prejudice that is including hodjat story is quite complicated set up but compelling moving it gives audience time breathe but with tension drama that fuels what is happening storytelling i found myself never being able look away characters are sensitively explored while ive not seen about elly while i do remember that i didnt relate as much characters there than i did here acting is wonderful leila hatami especially good peyman moadi shahab hosseini sareh bayat give performances that wholly justified sharing silver berlin bear one mustnt forget sarina farhadi whose increasing intensity her acting is what makes separations storytelling case it depicts even more engrossing conclusion one best 2011 considering how hit miss that year was films thats saying bit 10 10 bethany cox,0.6015849673202613,0.32660130718954244,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.31}"
10.0,You be the judge...,"I'm an Iranian, but I've never been interested in Iranian cinema. I only watch Iranian films when they win awards or receive international recognition. I'm a fan of Kiarostami and Majidi, but I can't really say that I like all of their films. I watched Farhady's previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event. At the time, I believed this to have been the cause of this director's success. Watching Nader and Simin, however, proved that I was terribly mistaken.Asghar Farhady's obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The life-like depiction of the Iranian courtroom (which is in no way impartial) places the audience in the Judge's seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up his/her mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay, I'm almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life, because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events, so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.Despite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture (the sanctity of Family, faith, commitment towards parents and married life), I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke (although I'm pretty sure it won't be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons).After seeing About Elly, I thought Farhady's success was just a one-time fling, but coming out of the theater, having watched Nader and Simin, I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites.",you be judge,im iranian but ive never been interested iranian cinema i only watch iranian films when they win awards or receive international recognition im fan kiarostami majidi but i cant really say that i like all their films i watched farhadys previous film about elly about year ago first thing which struck me was how culturally detached movie was its depiction event at time i believed this have been cause this directors success watching nader simin however proved that i was terribly mistaken asghar farhadys obsession with concept judgment is once again driving force behind his latest feature life like depiction iranian courtroom which is no way impartial places audience judges seat very beginning extremely believable acting insanely complex script compel viewer make up his her mind just like when reading court case as screenplay im almost certain events this film actually happened real life because no way could one fabricate such chaotically complex series events so beautifully woven into coherent whole despite being very iranian its narrative style its depiction iranian culture sanctity family faith commitment towards parents married life i believe that this film could easily appeal western audiences just like film by inaritu or haneke although im pretty sure it wont be nominated oscar political reasons after seeing about elly i thought farhadys success was just one time fling but coming out theater having watched nader simin i was proud have another iranian director added my international list favorites,0.43657796451914105,0.16561624649859943,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Entirely captivating,"Today I had the pleasure of watching A Separation, a foreign film that has been critically-acclaimed for some time now. What we have here is definitely one of the year's best films. Intriguing, captivating, and ambiguous.I had no idea that this was going to turn out to be some sort of court drama. I just want to first talk about the direction. Farhadi masterfully constructs these characters, and we enter into a state in their lives where we serve as some sort of observant. Even before the actual plot of the film comes along, his tight screenplay and direction leave us trying to astutely observe what is happening around every corner of the frame. We barely know these characters, and yet, tension is arising from the simplest of every-day matters. Why? Why indeed, as it becomes apparent, the film gets more serious in its plot. It is here that the real reason as to why we are observing moments of these characters' lives comes into focus. Questions arise, as to who did what, and who saw what, and who heard this or that. The film takes a neutral ground in all of this, and yet we ourselves can't help but try to memorize even the smallest of details that could perhaps help us out in figuring out the actual truth. The film never judges its characters, which is why we also have to be sort of neutral in all of this, even when we don't want to, even when we think we know what really happened. This is a mystery in the most unusual and most natural way. We are hooked into the film's plot line, and as much as the film won't let us go, we don't want to let go. We want to hang on and catch up with it, and not miss one single beat of what is happening. Such precise and balanced filmmaking.I do want to take note of the fantastic performances. The entire cast is wonderful, especially the three main leads. Not one single moment is wasted in their portrayals.

,People lie,"Beneath the opening credits, a photocopier copies IDs, one after another.We open to a courtroom. A beautiful married couple, Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moadi) have obtained coveted visas to leave Iran for the United States, where Simin hopes to offer a better future to their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh (the director's daughter, Sarina Farhadi). Simin has red hair and determined eyes; Nader has an honest face. They address the camera as if we are the judge.""You don't have good reasons for a divorce."" Their hard-won visa expires in a month or two; Nader will not leave, Simin must, with Termeh. The problem, Nader is devoted to his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who has Alzheimer disease and is totally dependent on his son and his family. And so the couple embark on a trial separation.An upper middle-class household, a stable home, parents who value education and security for their daughter perhaps above all.Simi has found a caretaker, Razieh (Sareh Bayat), a pregnant, deeply religious woman with a young daughter who takes the job unbeknownst to her husband (Shahab Hosseini), an out-of-work cobbler. A devout woman with a young daughter (Kimia Hosseini), to mind his father while he is at work.Negotiations - she lives far away, the pay is not good, her husband does not know. The first day, grandpa pees his pants. Modesty. Razieh asks him to clean himself up; he can only ask for Simin. She makes a call to her imam for religious advice. She can clean the old man. Her daughter watches through frosted glass, ever curious.In the meantime, Nader teaches his daughter to be assertive, first with the gas station attendant.The caretaker quits. It's heavy work for a pregnant woman and a little girl. We know she's pregnant, but does Nader? It's a big problem. Who else? Razieh comes back. My husband. He cannot know you hired me.

I agree with this answer from a film that comes from the other side of the world, from a country which I perceive to have religion and politics utterly different from mine. Because the film transcends the detail, it just shows the essence of being human. The characters just keep on trying to do the best for them or their family in credible situations which can apply to anyone and anywhere, but the choices they make will conflict at one time or another with some moral or legal tenet. The husband, the wife, the daughter, the old man's carer, the carer's husband, the daughter's teacher, even the judge – they all want to do the right thing, but they don't. Or do. Or don't. Or do. The beauty of this film is that it just tells the story. It doesn't take sides. It doesn't force on us an opinion on whether the choice was right or wrong. If it tried, I probably wouldn't have liked it as much, because it would have to conflict with some of my own views.

Universal human emotion set in an Islamic country. It is difficult for me to pinpoint what the theme(s) of this film. Yes, it begins with a separation of a couple after years of marriage and having a daughter in stake. But that was only a trigger. A trigger to a journey that seeks the boundaries of human existences. A journey where things are not black and white, but somewhere in between. The characters have their flaws but I somehow feel sympathy for them, even for the one who is violent. Perhaps the movie is about asking question what is a good person, in a situation where it is very difficult to be one.",asking difficult questions,have you ever been watching movie where you could not take your eyes screen not even one second take zip your wine this movie is me thriller even though labeled drama shoots were artistically taken i see beauty scene when woman is walking with her long vein downstairs couple arguing front judge where when she was asked whether man beats her because she wants divorce saying no he is good man but i want divorce this is universal story set iran universal human emotion set islamic country it is difficult me pinpoint what theme s this film yes it begins with separation couple after years marriage having daughter stake but that was only trigger trigger journey that seeks boundaries human existences journey where things are not black white but somewhere between characters have their flaws but i somehow feel sympathy them even one who is violent perhaps movie is about asking question what is good person situation where it is very difficult be one,0.45833333333333337,-0.05104166666666668,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.5}"
10.0,inside Iran,"While most reports about Iran have centered on its nuclear program, ""Jodái-e Náder az Simin"" (called ""A Separation"" in English) takes a look at the lives of the Iranian people. It focuses on a family falling apart, and how events proliferate from this. Every character is flawed but well-meaning, and so the audience can't really ""side"" with one character over the others. The basic gist of the movie is how this moral conundrum affects every person.The movie is now particularly famous because it is the first Iranian movie to win Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Accepting his Oscar last Sunday, director Asghar Farhadi reminded viewers that when there is talk of war, we truly need to see Iran for its great history and not accept a one-dimensional view of it. That was without a doubt the most important part of the ceremony, and ""A Separation"" is one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. Definitely worth seeing.",inside iran,while most reports about iran have centered its nuclear program jod i e n der az simin called separation english takes look at lives iranian people it focuses family falling apart how events proliferate this every character is flawed but well meaning so audience cant really side with one character over others basic gist movie is how this moral conundrum affects every person movie is now particularly famous because it is first iranian movie win best foreign language film at academy awards accepting his oscar last sunday director asghar farhadi reminded viewers that when there is talk war we truly need see iran its great history not accept one dimensional view it that was without doubt most important part ceremony separation is one best movies that ive seen long time definitely worth seeing,0.3805555555555556,0.30972222222222223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10.0,A Story of Responsibility and Truth,"Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) are a middle-class, modern, urban Iranian couple. They have been married for fourteen years, but they're separating. They were going to divorce, but the court ruled that their situation wasn't dire enough to warrant it. They each have their side of the story. Simin desires to leave their country, as she does not want her eleven-year-old daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), growing up under current conditions. Nader, on the other hand, wants to stay so that he can look after his elderly father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), now in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Their situation becomes much more complicated after an incident, one directly involving the caregiver Nader hired to watch his father during the day. What begins as a simple argument between two people quickly escalates into arduous legal action and a heated battle over what really happened.""A Separation"" is surely the best film of the year. Apart from being a portrait of characters that are just as fascinating as they are compelling, it's an intelligent and uncompromising examination of culture; within the course of what appears to be a simple narrative, we will have been told a thing or two about gender roles, parenting styles, personal values, the rule of law, and religious beliefs as they apply to present-day Iran. Although not a courtroom drama in the Hollywood sense, it has the superb plotting of a tightly-wound legal thriller, the characters in a desperate struggle to reconstruct a singular event out of several accounts. It is, above all, a timely and universally resonant story of responsibility and truth, the latter of which proves to be open for debate.I want to word the rest of my review as carefully as possible, as the incident in question is dependent on actions that shouldn't be spoiled. Based on Simin's recommendation, Nader hires a lower-class young woman named Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to be his father's caregiver. Deeply religious, Razieh went against her own traditions by applying for the job without the approval of her husband. She resorted to this only because her family is desperately in need of money. There are three reasons why she proves herself the wrong person for the job, although I will only reveal two of them. First, getting to Nader's apartment requires a grueling commute on several buses. Second, she's forced to bring along her daughter, who's clearly too young to be in an environment of a man with Alzheimer's. It's not just a question of exposure to something potentially traumatic; in her innocence, she doesn't see the harm of fiddling with the pressure knob of his oxygen tank.My careful wording will now devolve into maddening vagueness. Someone makes a very bad decision, leaving someone else's life at stake. Not long after, something goes missing. The person it belongs to immediately accuses someone else of stealing, and indeed, this someone else does have a motive. This leads to a verbal altercation, which then leads to ... the incident I've alluded to several times now. At this point, an already challenging film transcends itself by drawing us into a twisted moral quandary. Several pivotal characters are introduced as the incident turns legal. We meet Razieh's husband, Houjat (Shahab Hosseini), who has been unemployed for several months now and cannot speak without resorting to anger. We also meet an upstairs neighbor, who may have witnessed something important, and Termeh's teacher, who testifies on behalf of Nader.Caught in the middle is Termeh, who not only must endure her father's legal troubles but must also watch as both her parents continue to fight. We're repeatedly compelled to ask ourselves which of them truly has her best interests at heart, although that would be senseless simply because it's never as clear cut as we would like it to be. This is the kind of film in which we can identify with both sides of an issue; each character makes valid points, just as each character makes weak arguments. The more we learn about the situation, the murkier it becomes. That's because there's far more on the table than a series of actions.What it really comes down to are the beliefs with which we shape our lives. For Razieh, it's a matter of her faith, to which she is bound. Consider the fact that she's forbidden from touching a man other than her husband; when she discovers that Nader's father is incontinent and has peed in his pants, she must make a phone call to determine whether or not she can change him. For the secular Nader and Simin, it's a matter of personal pride. One will propose a financial settlement while the other will refuse to take part in it, as it will come off as an admission of guilt. They both think they know best, not just for their daughter but also for the situation at hand. By the end of ""A Separation,"" more than one person will be faced with making a difficult decision, one that will depend entirely on their understanding of what they perceive.

8.0,"A Peek into Iran's Family, Religious and Justice Systems","""A Separation"" is the foreign-language film of this year's awards season. After it won the Golden Globes last week, you know it is a cinch to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film and most probably win the coveted prize for its country of origin, Iran.""A Separation"" is about a middle-class Iranian family. In the first scene, husband and wife are divorcing after 14 years of marriage because of a disagreement on migration. Wife wants a better life abroad, while husband does not want to leave his Alzheimer-stricken dad. Caught in the middle is their 12-year old daughter. When wife leaves their home, the husband hires a poor woman to be his dad's caretaker while he is at work. From there, this harrowing family and societal drama evolves into situations you will not expect. The climax and the ending were so effectively executed. You will not want to leave even while the final credits are already rolling.It appears that director Azghar Farhadi is really a big name in Iran, and that he already has previous acclaimed films. I will want to check them out. His control of his story and his actors (who you would not even remember are acting) is amazing. You get sucked into the story, and you will not want to get to the bottom of things until the final resolution. It has an underlying allusion to the conflict between the old and the new customs. It is an interesting peek into the family dynamics, religion and criminal justice system in Iran. I have seen only one other nominee in the last Golden Globe, ""The Flowers of War."" The scope and genre of the two films are vastly different and is hard to compare. But I could say that ""A Separation"" is the tighter and better- written film.",peek into irans family religious justice systems,separation is foreign language film this years awards season after it won golden globes last week you know it is cinch earn oscar nomination best foreign film most probably win coveted prize its country origin iran separation is about middle class iranian family first scene husband wife are divorcing after 14 years marriage because disagreement migration wife wants better life abroad while husband does not want leave his alzheimer stricken dad caught middle is their 12 year old daughter when wife leaves their home husband hires poor woman be his dads caretaker while he is at work there this harrowing family societal drama evolves into situations you will not expect climax ending were so effectively executed you will not want leave even while final credits are already rolling it appears that director azghar farhadi is really big name iran that he already has previous acclaimed films i will want check them out his control his story his actors who you would not even remember are acting is amazing you get sucked into story you will not want get bottom things until final resolution it has underlying allusion conflict between old new customs it is interesting peek into family dynamics religion criminal justice system iran i have seen only one other nominee last golden globe flowers war scope genre two films are vastly different is hard compare but i could say that separation is tighter better written film,0.40165289256198344,0.14403122130394858,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.38}"
,Brilliant,"I saw this last night at the Auckland Film Festival and have to say it is probably the finest film I've seen this year. It starts incredibly strongly then just keeps cranking up the tension and conflict. The characters are beautifully layered, complex and fascinating and the director manages to maintain empathy for all of them until the final frame, simply not allowing us to 'take sides' - which is what the couple's daughter is being asked to do. I hope this film gets wide distribution (particularly into the U.S.) as its insight into modern Iranian family life (albeit a privileged one) might help to erase the convenient misconception that 'they' are not like 'us'.",brilliant,i saw this last night at auckland film festival have say it is probably finest film ive seen this year it starts incredibly strongly then just keeps cranking up tension conflict characters are beautifully layered complex fascinating director manages maintain empathy all them until final frame simply not allowing us take sides which is what couples daughter is being asked do i hope this film gets wide distribution particularly into u s as its insight into modern iranian family life albeit privileged one might help erase convenient misconception that they are not like us,0.5854978354978354,0.25909090909090904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.48}"
