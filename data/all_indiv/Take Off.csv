7,Takes Off. ♦ Grade B-,"Thrillers in the backdrop of civil wars is relatively new for Malayalam cinema, unless you consider Major Ravi's turkeys as films. This one here by a debutante director thoroughly impresses, mostly because of its gut-wrenching story based on true events that is highly relevant as we move forward in 2017...Sameera (Parvathy) is a nervy young Muslim woman who is the sole breadwinner of her family. A nurse at a local hospital, she, along with few of her colleagues, has now received an opportunity to go and work for the Iraqi government. Money is the only motivation for her right now, and the fact that she is a divorcée acts as a thorn to her ultimate quest: lead a merry life. Cajoled by her family, she finally reciprocates her love for Shaheed (Kunchacko Boban), a fellow nurse at her hospital. They marry and leave for the Muslim country as a couple, unbeknown to the reality that is waiting to encapsulate and destroy their healing lives...The story follows Sameera, her husband, and a bunch of Indian nurses who find themselves in the middle of the ongoing civil war in Iraq. Director Mahesh Narayan and writer P V Shajikumar have developed a tight story to drive home few messages, the primary of which involves the existence of hope and how it helps you fight the darkest of fears. With the ISIS controlling their part of Iraq, it is Sameera's leadership and conviction that the writers try to highlight here, referring a lot of relevant, stark social causes along the way.Director Narayan has crafted his story well, closing all loose ends and narrating the story in an efficient way right from the beginning. Once you ignore and go past the spelling mistakes in the opening credits and a very long preamble, things start catching pace as Sameera spearheads the screen with her absolutely nuanced performance (one of the best of 2017 so far) as the highly-strung woman. The little bits of pulpy storytelling with dashes of fervent realism, humor, and romance makes the first half an engaging experience. Viewers can definitely relate to the characters: be it that of Sameera or one of her in-laws who are torchbearers of suppression. Sameera is full of anxiety because she has this bucket of responsibilities over her head that she has to deal with, and at the same time has to sustain the heavy societal pressures that challenge her ambitions as a whole. Feminism is not really the topic here, but the makers definitely hint at the hardships that women have to go through in a conservative society, here, in spite of being the only working person in her family. Sameera is an independent woman and the story focuses on her conviction to stand abreast even when a rifle's barrel is pointed at her forehead. The extents that she goes in the second half to do what she has to do is a powerful rendition of all the strong voices that sway in the air around us, making us all have faith in our world riddle with hate and chaos.With a powerful score backing the on screen happenings, the bloodshed, the shelling, the horror - the film does not sit idle one single moment. Viewers are bound to see themselves on the edge of their seats, rooting for the characters even as the emotional thriller starts tugging at your vulnerable heart strings. It wouldn't be surprising to see a tear escaping your eye as you follow Sameera's journey through the bullet-ridden streets of Iraq. Moreover, there's some great photography here, depicting the bloodied parchments of Mosul and Tikrit - which all add up to the film's superiority in terms of storytelling and production design. I was not really impressed with the camera work, but the cast performance is so brilliant, you can easily ignore it.As mentioned above, Parvathy is fabulous as Sameera, the main protagonist of the film. She is well-supported by Boban, Fahadh Faasil, Asif Ali, and Prakash Belawadi. It is the performance and realistic portrayal of the characters that helps one ignore all the minor shortcomings of the film which has something to do with convenience and forced writing. However, the film asks you to look at the brighter side, so that's what we should do. Narayan has directed his actors well, and created a gripping package for the Malayalam audience to watch and get enthralled at after last month's Jay K's groundbreaking horror film, ""Ezra"". If you remove the civil war part from the film, it is evident that the focus is on the masterly profession of nurse. And the film as a whole pays ode to that profession, saluting the millions of nurses (White Helmets, Red Cross) who courageously defy the odds and fight for people's good health even in times of absolute despair. A la Raja Krishna Menon's 2016 blockbuster Bollywood film, ""Airlift"", this one is a real triumph in Malayalam cinema, giving us a great, heart- wrenching take on the ongoing war. Had there been a meme for this film, the text in it would summarize the story of the film as ""Restoring faith in humanity"". With an F- word sampled towards the end, this film achieves more things than it originally signed up for and that makes me extremely happy.BOTTOM LINE: Mahesh Narayan's ""Take Off"" is a well-crafted story about the power of hope in a world threatened by growing terrorism. It samples a lot of emotions that is so rare in Malayalam cinema, it is like a breath of fresh air. Book a ticket and watch it in your nearest theater now. It's a film that couldn't have released at a better time.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

6,A depressing movie and review,"While watching this movie, I realized that it really does suck to be an Indian. We have to stand in queues to get jobs, to emigrate to other countries or even to buy a bottle of alcohol. Our lives are a series of application forms to be filled and photostats to be submitted. I had tears in my eyes during the first scene and even the scenes at the end with the pictures of the nurses meeting their families after. Why are we always at the mercy of governments and dictators? I loved the account of the Muslim lady's personal life. But hated the scene where she dons the burqa with glee. Would one Indian filmmaker have the guts to feature a scene where a Muslim lady tears off her burqa? The patriotic scenes towards the end were also a bit cringe-worthy. I mean, these ladies left the country for Iraq because they could not make ends meet with their meager salaries in the so called fastest growing economy in the world. Take Off must also be one of the first films in the world about the ISIS menace.Parvathi pretty much carries this film on her shoulders. She towers over the three other leading men. She completely owned this film. I was not too impressed by her in Bangalore Days. But she really impressed me in this. I liked the film because it accurately portrays the sense of anomie and constant uncertainty that characterizes most Indian lives.",depressing movie review,while watching this movie i realized that it really does suck be indian we have stand queues get jobs emigrate other countries or even buy bottle alcohol our lives are series application forms be filled photostats be submitted i had tears my eyes during first scene even scenes at end with pictures nurses meeting their families after why are we always at mercy governments dictators i loved account muslim ladys personal life but hated scene where she dons burqa with glee would one indian filmmaker have guts feature scene where muslim lady tears off her burqa patriotic scenes towards end were also bit cringe worthy i mean these ladies left country iraq because they could not make ends meet with their meager salaries so called fastest growing economy world take off must also be one first films world about isis menace parvathi pretty much carries this film her shoulders she towers over three other leading men she completely owned this film i was not too impressed by her bangalore days but she really impressed me this i liked film because it accurately portrays sense anomie constant uncertainty that characterizes most indian lives,0.5987318840579711,0.15307971014492755,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8,"Excellent Movie, A Must See","I was in for a surprise. I found the trailer good but the movie just blew my mind. From the initial scenes of character nurse Sameera's pain as she struggles between motherhood, a divorce, night shifts and also the tension to get a job in Iraq to the later scenes where she witnesses horribly injured patients at an Iraqi hospital and then the nightmare of ISIS terrorists who hold her & her colleagues hostage are shown brilliantly. Parvathy is near flawless as Sameera and hope she gets another state award for her performance. Kunchacko Boban as her husband and Fahadh Fasil as an Indian Embassy officer are the other major characters in the movie and they both deliver very well. This movie may draw comparisons with the Bollywood movie Airlift released last year due to similar theme of Indians caught in a war zone in Middle East. I'd say both are very good in their own way although each has some flaws too. What I'd remember Take Off for is Parvathy's performance and also many of the tense scenes that involve the terrorists. They get seared into your brain long after the movie is over. But as this movie is only inspired by true events, some of the liberties taken with the story fail to convince in few scenes. Also, the reaction of Fahadh's character to the news that his decision saved some of the Indians from an explosion on a road is quite cinematic, it almost mocks the deaths of the other nationalities caught in that tragedy. But these are somewhat minor flaws in an otherwise masterfully made movie of hope and the will to endure any crisis. I think it's a must see.",excellent movie must see,i was surprise i found trailer good but movie just blew my mind initial scenes character nurse sameeras pain as she struggles between motherhood divorce night shifts also tension get job iraq later scenes where she witnesses horribly injured patients at iraqi hospital then nightmare isis terrorists who hold her her colleagues hostage are shown brilliantly parvathy is near flawless as sameera hope she gets another state award her performance kunchacko boban as her husband fahadh fasil as indian embassy officer are other major characters movie they both deliver very well this movie may draw comparisons with bollywood movie airlift released last year due similar theme indians caught war zone middle east id say both are very good their own way although each has some flaws too what id remember take off is parvathys performance also many tense scenes that involve terrorists they get seared into your brain long after movie is over but as this movie is only inspired by true events some liberties taken with story fail convince few scenes also reaction fahadhs character news that his decision saved some indians explosion road is quite cinematic it almost mocks deaths other nationalities caught that tragedy but these are somewhat minor flaws otherwise masterfully made movie hope will endure any crisis i think its must see,0.5007738095238096,0.17193452380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.56}"
8,Review – Take Off (2017) .. Mahesh Narayanan's directorial debut is confident & captivating!,"It all goes back to the saying.. the backbone of any film lies in the script and its treatment. In 'Take Off', editor-turned director Mahesh Narayanan presents the ordeal of a group of Keralite nurses stranded in the city of Tikrit, Iraq at the time when ISIS militants took over its reigns. Mahesh centers his story around Sameera (played by a brilliantly nuanced Parvathy) and certain characters who walk in and out of her life. Two things that warrant applause apart from the screenplay are the spot-on casting and excellent performances.Almost the entire first half is spent portraying the decisive evolution of the lead characters. The viewer learns about Sameera's traits, her family backdrop and the circumstances that coax her to become a divorcée and take up a job in Iraq. Kunchacko Boban displays great maturity in delivering an utterly grounded performance, ably supporting Parvathy. Asif Ali is also present in a cameo, and does his part well. The interval block is executed pretty well. The film dives into thriller mode soonafter. That's also when Fahadh Faasil's character (an Indian Ambassador) enters the scene. As Manoj Abraham, he exudes confidence and turns out to be a show- stopper on multiple instances.The physical and psychological torment faced by the victims are divulged with absolute honesty and in thoroughly-gripping fashion. The original background score by Gopi Sunder suits the tensive mood of the film. Cinematography by Sanu Varghese is commendable and adds a dash of realism to the exquisitely rich frames. Blood and sand aren't exactly the most pleasing sights to look at, yet Sanu and director Mahesh ensure that they have an enthralling story to narrate, even with their inclusion in heavy dosage. There are certain standout scenes that keep lingering in the viewer's mind long after they leave the cinema hall..such as the one where Sameera meets Manoj to discuss the update on her husband's whereabouts..and the sequence where she breaks down while conversing with him over the phone. The climax is devoid of major edge-of-the-seat moments, still ends up being one of the most satisfying Malayalam movie experiences in recent memory.The production design definitely draws parallels to its much costlier Bollywood counterpart, last year's Akshay Kumar starrer 'AirLift'. That movie attempted to depict the evacuation of Kuwait- based Indians as a one-man show with much lesser emotional pay-off. Here, the viewer is literally placed in the midst of all the psychological trauma faced by those strong-willed individuals who are coerced into compromising their remuneration and religious beliefs in order to stay alive; the emotional element integrated seamlessly into each and every aspect of the film. If there is still a notable drawback to speak of, it could be the way in which a couple of bomb-blast sequences are executed with the help of not-so- great C.G.I (still a harrowing factor in Malayalam films). Thankfully, this flick does not have to depend too much on computer- generated effects, and hence, even this minor snag can be conveniently absolved.Benefiting from a riveting screenplay coupled with passionate performances, 'Take Off' also boasts of overall technical perfection and slick production values that make it stand out from the rest of the clutter by a wide margin. For once, the hype paid off. Awaiting your next, Mahesh!Recommended?

8,Take Off is another worth watching film of Malayalam with terrific performances and engaging screenplay.,"Take Off (2017):Take Off is inspired by the real-life rescue of Indian nurses who were stranded in Tikrit, Iraq, during the country's civil war in 2014.Starring one of my favorite actress Parvathy Menon,I had huge expectations on this film.So how is it?Plot:Sameera (Parvathy Thiruvoth) is a 31-year-old nurse who is being forced by her circumstances to take a job in Iraq.She is a divorcée and has an eight-year-old son,but that's not a problem at all for Shahid (Kunchacko Boban),her colleague, who is ready to accompany her to the troubled land. Sameera accepts to marry him, in yet another attempt to keep her and her closed ones' life afloat.But when they land in Iraq,things starts getting worse.Plus Points:1)Performances: Parvathy plays Sameera with the sense of perfection she is known for. The agonies of a woman caught caught up in a cobweb of personal, professional and even international crises come alive on screen through her.Definitely an award winning performance.Kunchacko pulls a restrained and subtle performance as Shahid, who also serves as the undying ray of hope in Sameera's life.Fahadh is show-stealer in second half.His expressions of contempt and impudence at his senior officials add a few doses of heroism in the film.2)Screenplay and Direction: Editor-turned-filmmaker Mahesh Narayanan's debut directorial is exceptional.With the story being familiar, the challenge awaiting the director was presenting the plot in an engaging manner, taking cinematic liberties. And Mahesh along with co-scriptwriter PV Shajikumar does it with aplomb.Never once does it slack – despite the first half being a drama. The director also ensures that in between the taut screenplay, the movie addresses the plight of nurses who travel abroad seeking employment to pay off loans, to take care of their family and for better prospects even if it means putting their lives on the line.So,Take Off is another worth watching film of Malayalam with terrific performances and engaging screenplay.My rating 7.5/10",take off is another worth watching film malayalam with terrific performances engaging screenplay,take off 2017 take off is inspired by real life rescue indian nurses who were stranded tikrit iraq during countrys civil war 2014 starring one my favorite actress parvathy menon i had huge expectations this film so how is it plot sameera parvathy thiruvoth is 31 year old nurse who is being forced by her circumstances take job iraq she is divorc e has eight year old son but thats not problem at all shahid kunchacko boban her colleague who is ready accompany her troubled land sameera accepts marry him yet another attempt keep her her closed ones life afloat but when they land iraq things starts getting worse plus points 1 performances parvathy plays sameera with sense perfection she is known agonies woman caught caught up cobweb personal professional even international crises come alive screen through her definitely award winning performance kunchacko pulls restrained subtle performance as shahid who also serves as undying ray hope sameeras life fahadh is show stealer second half his expressions contempt impudence at his senior officials add few doses heroism film 2 screenplay direction editor turned filmmaker mahesh narayanans debut directorial is exceptional with story being familiar challenge awaiting director was presenting plot engaging manner taking cinematic liberties mahesh along with co scriptwriter pv shajikumar does it with aplomb never once does it slack despite first half being drama director also ensures that between taut screenplay movie addresses plight nurses who travel abroad seeking employment pay off loans take care their family better prospects even if it means putting their lives line so take off is another worth watching film malayalam with terrific performances engaging screenplay my rating 7 5 10,0.4387254901960783,0.10661764705882353,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.51}"
8,"A Classic Evacuation Drama with Emotional Intelligence. What Bollywood's 'Airlift' missed, Take Off has got it alright.","Take Off (2017) : Brief Review -A Classic Evacuation Drama with Emotional Intelligence. What Bollywood's 'Airlift' missed, Take Off has got it alright. Since Hollywood's 'Argo' won Oscars, this evacuation theme got rolling. Bollywood made a spy thriller 'Baby' which had lots of similarities with that and then Raja Menon's evacuation drama 'Airlift' staged it in decent manners. However, the actual potential of emotional and patriotic quotient was not matched by Airlift and it has really bothered me since then. Now, i am very glad to have seen Malayalam Drama 'Take Off' which has matched a certain level of potential and expectations with engrossing human elements. In 2014, a group of Malayali nurses was captured when terrorists took over the city of Tikrit in Iraq. This movie recounts the ordeal suffered by the nurses following their capture. The film looks little offtrack in the begining, not just the beginning but the entire first half is used just to set the things up before the capture. I still think that was not needed but then i have to give a credit for creating a bond between those 3 characters of Husband, his pregnant wife and her son. So, it's like you get to see a family drama in the first half and then thrilling evacuation drama in the second half. The film is powered by the incredible performances of Parvathy Thiruvothu, Kunchacko Boban and Fahadh Faasil. The screenplay is terrific in the second half, the dialogue are fine, cinematography is excellent and Mahesh Narayan's direction is super nice. He crafts a good story with smart conflicts, that's the only thing Airlift missed after directorial genius. Overall, Take Off is a must watch experience. It's high on emotions, passion, reliability and most importantly it has those much needed goosebumps moments coming at right time in right form. Don't miss it.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",classic evacuation drama with emotional intelligence what bollywoods airlift missed take off has got it alright,take off 2017 brief review classic evacuation drama with emotional intelligence what bollywoods airlift missed take off has got it alright since hollywoods argo won oscars this evacuation theme got rolling bollywood made spy thriller baby which had lots similarities with that then raja menons evacuation drama airlift staged it decent manners however actual potential emotional patriotic quotient was not matched by airlift it has really bothered me since then now i am very glad have seen malayalam drama take off which has matched certain level potential expectations with engrossing human elements 2014 group malayali nurses was captured when terrorists took over city tikrit iraq this movie recounts ordeal suffered by nurses following their capture film looks little offtrack begining not just beginning but entire first half is used just set things up before capture i still think that was not needed but then i have give credit creating bond between those 3 characters husband his pregnant wife her son so its like you get see family drama first half then thrilling evacuation drama second half film is powered by incredible performances parvathy thiruvothu kunchacko boban fahadh faasil screenplay is terrific second half dialogue are fine cinematography is excellent mahesh narayans direction is super nice he crafts good story with smart conflicts thats only thing airlift missed after directorial genius overall take off is must watch experience its high emotions passion reliability most importantly it has those much needed goosebumps moments coming at right time right form dont miss it rating 8 10 by,0.5144101731601731,0.19066287878787883,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.25}"
8,'Take off' really shines due to superb execution. The strength of the film is that it is very close to reality.,"Click here to know the source of this image Take Off, A Malayalam film by editor-turned-filmmaker Mahesh Narayanan, is based on the real incident of forty-six Indian Nurses being rescued from Tikrit (Iraq) in 2014. These nurses were initially stranded at a hospital in Tikrit and later moved to Mosul, then to Erbil from where they were flown into Kerala on a special aircraft arranged by the Indian Government. The then Chief Minister Uman Chandy, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, her officials and Indian Ambassador in Iraq Ajay Kumar were instrumental in this evacuation of nurses. It is heartening to see that stories based on such real incidents are being made. Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur's Airlift (2016 Hindi film) was another brilliant film by Raja Krishna Menon, which was based on the evacuation of 1,70,000 Indians during 1990 Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait. 'Take off' takes us through the ordeal of people stranded in Iraq when the ISIS invaded Iraq in 2014. Take off is an equally brilliant effort as that of Airlift, rather, it is even more realistic. The challenge with such real life stories is to make it close to reality as well as engaging for the audience. Mahesh Narayanan has executed it brilliantly.Sameera (Parvathy) is a nurse who is struggling hard to make both ends meet for herself and her family. Her marriage to Faizal (Asif Ali) could not be successful which led to their divorce. She is shown to be in a frustrated mood in the initial frames, although she does not allow this to hamper her work. She aspires to travel abroad to Iraq so that she can earn more and look after her family well. Shaheed (Kunchako Boban), a male nurse in the same hospital, is keen to get married to Sameera, but she in her grumpy mood keeps rejecting Shaheed. But later, she decides to give herself a second chance by getting married to Shaheed. Both of them along with their other colleagues get visa to travel to Iraq. Life was certainly not easy at Iraq for them, had to live amongst gunshots, bomb blasts and look after badly injured patients. Situations in Iraq kept on deteriorating further. The war zone had made Sameera's external world full of chaos but a new life was there within her. Her son Ibrahim from first marriage joins her in Iraq. Crisis enhances to a level where every single moment was turning more and more challenging for everyone out there. Life was under threat. Situations separate Sameera and Shaheed.There begins the story of survival amidst this crisis and frantic search of Shaheed by Sameera. She goes to Indian Embassy for help and that is where Manoj (Fahad Faasil) enters into the scene as Indian Ambassador to Iraq. How the story moves further? How do the nurses survive in this crisis ? Does Sameera get lucky and able to locate Shaheed? How does Indian Government act for this rescue operation ? What timely as well as risky decisions led to the rescue ?Fahad has given another brilliant performance. Parvathy as Sameera has given a stellar performance, exceptionally well. Kunchako Boban is extremely good in his role. Prakash Belwadi as superior to Fahad's character Manoj is wonderful. Asif has less screen time yet very much noticeable.

Parvathy and Fahad Fazil are super competent in their respective acts. But they could not stop me from losing interest in the happenings, as there is barely a scene that makes you catch your breath, which I expected as the second half is set in what was then ISIS territory.The background music is soulful and heart rending.

9,Wow!,"Brutally gripping and brilliantly realistic, this is all that Airlift tried to be but couldn't. Not just the best Malayalam movie of the year, but one of the best of the year overall. Parvathy amazes with each role she takes up, every one of them different from the other, and she carries this movie on her able shoulders. Fahad Fazil, Kunchako Boban and others provide admirable support, but the biggest kudos should go to the director here.

10,Underrated Brilliant Oscar Worthy Production,"BRILLIANTI had been recommended Take Off but having already seen the Hindi Airlift and Tiger Zinda Hai, I was not in a hurry to see a similarly themed film and caught Take Off(orig. Malayalam w/Eng. subs) only now. Simply put, it is an outstanding production and superior to the 2 aforementioned Bollywood movies (which were also good films). I rarely get affected by feature films but I was truly moved by this one.The plot is based on the true war zone evacuation of Indian nurses from Taliban controlled territory despite all odds, with the help of private players as well as the government.Parvathy is brilliant as the protagonist nurse and this is probably Kunchako Boban's finest role. All the actors are very good. The film is realistic, various relationships are beautifully portrayed, the sets, the cinematography everything is good and holds the interest throughout.No Spoilers as this is a film really worth seeing for those who havent already. Im really surprised and its a poor reflection on India's film authorities, that Take Off was not given the Best Indian Film award, nor nominated as India's Oscar entry for that year. Unfortunately Hindi seems to be the 'favoured language'.",underrated brilliant oscar worthy production,brillianti had been recommended take off but having already seen hindi airlift tiger zinda hai i was not hurry see similarly themed film caught take off orig malayalam w eng subs only now simply put it is outstanding production superior 2 aforementioned bollywood movies which were also good films i rarely get affected by feature films but i was truly moved by this one plot is based true war zone evacuation indian nurses taliban controlled territory despite all odds with help private players as well as government parvathy is brilliant as protagonist nurse this is probably kunchako bobans finest role all actors are very good film is realistic various relationships are beautifully portrayed sets cinematography everything is good holds interest throughout no spoilers as this is film really worth seeing those who havent already im really surprised its poor reflection indias film authorities that take off was not given best indian film award nor nominated as indias oscar entry that year unfortunately hindi seems be favoured language,0.6595859213250518,0.3395652173913043,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.18}"

8,Not Gullible Enough,"Take Off might a handful of those films which essay the emotions of those events that happened in real life into the wide screen with an array of exemplary actors and actresses. Take Off doesn't fail as a film but it fails as a theme to capture the minds of the avid film lovers into the true nature of the belief system existing nowadays. Take Off takes us into the various atmospheres, succeeding at some and failing at a few. Although i liked how the Malayalam industry is progressing into making a class film with some really good themes to prey upon, it should not also forget that developing something too much can also result in downfall. Take Off might be a film that will be praised for a short while, but in the long run films better than this will take its spot. In terms of the story and screenplay, Take Off has shone brightly, with some technical glitches aside Take Off is a masterpiece in color grading and exemplary cinematography. The Cinematography done by Sanu Varghese is truly magnificent, providing a platform for the viewers to choose upon. The other technical aspects have been dealt with nicely, with nail biting score and composing, Take Off is a film that you should grab your seats for. The screenplay covers the shame induced by the story. Even though the film has laid out a fundamental theme that could have been developed better, the ongoing screenplay between the various amount of characters was shown clinically beautiful, laboring the need for a better screenwriter next time.Overall, Take Off should have been a film that would have been termed a 'masterpiece' but it falls a little short of that at the end. Take Off is a must watch for everyone ; Patriotism, Action, Emotions and aesthetically present humor is vividly brought the screen by a solid script and a perfectly molded cast.8.4 / 10 A BIG HIGH FIVE !",not gullible enough,take off might handful those films which essay emotions those events that happened real life into wide screen with array exemplary actors actresses take off doesnt fail as film but it fails as theme capture minds avid film lovers into true nature belief system existing nowadays take off takes us into various atmospheres succeeding at some failing at few although i liked how malayalam industry is progressing into making class film with some really good themes prey upon it should not also forget that developing something too much can also result downfall take off might be film that will be praised short while but long run films better than this will take its spot terms story screenplay take off has shone brightly with some technical glitches aside take off is masterpiece color grading exemplary cinematography cinematography done by sanu varghese is truly magnificent providing platform viewers choose upon other technical aspects have been dealt with nicely with nail biting score composing take off is film that you should grab your seats screenplay covers shame induced by story even though film has laid out fundamental theme that could have been developed better ongoing screenplay between various amount characters was shown clinically beautiful laboring need better screenwriter next time overall take off should have been film that would have been termed masterpiece but it falls little short that at end take off is must watch everyone patriotism action emotions aesthetically present humor is vividly brought screen by solid script perfectly molded cast 8 4 10 big high five,0.4436486486486486,0.1830405405405405,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"
