10.0,Sweet!,"Don is a very bad boy. In an international syndicate of smugglers, Don is the meanest of them all. Mess with Don and you're dead. It's not just difficult to catch the Don... it's impossible!Amitabh Bachchan plays Don like every cool dude rolled into one - Shaft, Dirty Harry, and err... other cool dudes! That is until he takes a bullet 30 minutes into the movie and dies. ""Wait a minute - this movie is 3 hours long, and they've killed the title character already!"" is bound to be your first thought at this. But it's alright, because the only man to see him die, the police 'DSP', happens to know of a man who is Don's exact double... and he has a plan. He trains up the amiable betel-nut chewing street performer in the ways of the Don, and sends him undercover to root out evidence against the rest of the gang. Here Amitabh gets to show his range - from badass cool dude to goofball to goofball pretending to be a badass cool dude, he fits the role (and those flared trousers) to a tee.Don has clearly been made from concentrated 1970's extract... and it's cheesier than a McDonald's Cheeseburger where they forgot to give you everything but the cheese - and when you go up to the counter to complain, they just give you more cheese . But even though you know it's probably going to make you fat and give you spots, you can't help going back for more. The movie manages to straddle that fine line between inspiration and idiocy where you find the rarest of substances - pure entertainment. This is not a movie to be taken seriously, and it could hardly be called a movie of great technical virtue. But Amitabh Bachchan takes the role(s) and gives them such a lot of character and life you can't help but love watching him. The crew of flared and paisleyed crooks and goons and the kung fu fighting revenge babe, the crippled tight rope walker and the well meaning but mostly simple police officers all make the Don's world an interesting environment to watch Amitabh at work and play too.And then there's the zoom lenses, the toe tapping funk tunes, the chase scenes that seem to leap miles between each cut, the fight scenes that are acted out in courteous slow motion (when they're not being bounced around on trampolines)... the song and dance routine opining on the virtues of mixing opiates and stimulants... With Tears Of The Black Tiger and Don all in one weekend I feel guilty, like I've just eaten a whole triple chocolate cake in one sitting... life just shouldn't be this much fun!If you've got 3 hours going spare, let the Don into your life too and he'll make you a happy chappy - I guarantee it!",sweet,don is very bad boy international syndicate smugglers don is meanest them all mess with don youre dead its not just difficult catch don its impossible amitabh bachchan plays don like every cool dude rolled into one shaft dirty harry err other cool dudes that is until he takes bullet 30 minutes into movie dies wait minute this movie is 3 hours long theyve killed title character already is bound be your first thought at this but its alright because only man see him die police dsp happens know man who is dons exact double he has plan he trains up amiable betel nut chewing street performer ways don sends him undercover root out evidence against rest gang here amitabh gets show his range badass cool dude goofball goofball pretending be badass cool dude he fits role those flared trousers tee don has clearly been made concentrated 1970s extract its cheesier than mcdonalds cheeseburger where they forgot give you everything but cheese when you go up counter complain they just give you more cheese but even though you know its probably going make you fat give you spots you cant help going back more movie manages straddle that fine line between inspiration idiocy where you find rarest substances pure entertainment this is not movie be taken seriously it could hardly be called movie great technical virtue but amitabh bachchan takes role s gives them such lot character life you cant help but love watching him crew flared paisleyed crooks goons kung fu fighting revenge babe crippled tight rope walker well meaning but mostly simple police officers all make dons world interesting environment watch amitabh at work play too then theres zoom lenses toe tapping funk tunes chase scenes that seem leap miles between each cut fight scenes that are acted out courteous slow motion when theyre not being bounced around trampolines song dance routine opining virtues mixing opiates stimulants with tears black tiger don all one weekend i feel guilty like ive just eaten whole triple chocolate cake one sitting life just shouldnt be this much fun if youve got 3 hours going spare let don into your life too hell make you happy chappy i guarantee it,0.5087585034013605,0.05200113378684809,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Do(w)n memory lane -- the golden era of Hindi cinema,"This movie is one of the earliest blockbusters of the 1970s that firmly launched Amitabh Bachchan in the superstar orbit.In an oft-repeated cop-robber plot, director Chandra Barot makes a film about a gangster don (no particular reference to any Mumbai underworld figure nor any sneaky take on a Hollywood film) who has eluded cops for a long time. ""Don ko pakadna itna aasan nahin"", says DCP D'Silva in an ominous tone that still resonates among the current duels between crime bosses and superstar cops like Daya Nayak.The essence of Don's charisma goes beyond the methodical framing of its central characters in what is a rather straightforward plot. Cleverly written dialogs that inspired an entire generation of moviegoers, shots and scenes that (at the time) defied the boundaries of all conventional wisdom, fabulous acting by the main and supporting cast, and a musical score by Kalyanji Anandji that is evergreen to this day -- those are of course what made Don such a memorable movie in the minds of many.Best thing is to go see it even if its your first or fifth time. Great movies such as this are way beyond Bollywood now, and it is doubtful if the current crap -- oops sorry, crop! of directors can ever concoct a compelling story such as this one.",do w n memory lane golden era hindi cinema,this movie is one earliest blockbusters 1970s that firmly launched amitabh bachchan superstar orbit oft repeated cop robber plot director chandra barot makes film about gangster don no particular reference any mumbai underworld figure nor any sneaky take hollywood film who has eluded cops long time don ko pakadna itna aasan nahin says dcp dsilva ominous tone that still resonates among current duels between crime bosses superstar cops like daya nayak essence dons charisma goes beyond methodical framing its central characters what is rather straightforward plot cleverly written dialogs that inspired entire generation moviegoers shots scenes that at time defied boundaries all conventional wisdom fabulous acting by main supporting cast musical score by kalyanji anandji that is evergreen this day those are course what made don such memorable movie minds many best thing is go see it even if its your first or fifth time great movies such as this are way beyond bollywood now it is doubtful if current crap oops sorry crop directors can ever concoct compelling story such as this one,0.5050170068027212,0.08686224489795917,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.35}"
9.0,Don is a COOL movie ;-),"There's not much to explain about the story of ""Don"", which probably EVERYONE knows about by now, right? It may not be a GREAT story...but none the less the movie is just totally entertaining ~ you watch Amitabh perform from a totally COOL-evil bad guy to a goofy paan-eating guy and trust me, it's impossible not to adore the man. He's just so COOL! His stunts rock too.Though I usually can't stand Zeenat Aman, in this movie she got such awesome clothing, and an awesome hairstyle topped with a really COOL role. Pran is also the regular COOL guy, about just as COOL as Amitabh, which is why it rocks to see them together on screen as usual.Pretty much everyone else in the movie played their roles well.And I have to mention Kalyanji-Anandji who were behind all of the totally COOL music throughout the movie. The background music and songs are made to match the COOLNESS of the movie :-D. Lata, Kishore, and Asha at their ultimate COOL.So watch this COOL movie so I can stop using the word COOL so much hehe. Khaike Paan Banaras Wala!",don is cool movie,theres not much explain about story don which probably everyone knows about by now right it may not be great story but none less movie is just totally entertaining you watch amitabh perform totally cool evil bad guy goofy paan eating guy trust me its impossible not adore man hes just so cool his stunts rock too though i usually cant stand zeenat aman this movie she got such awesome clothing awesome hairstyle topped with really cool role pran is also regular cool guy about just as cool as amitabh which is why it rocks see them together screen as usual pretty much everyone else movie played their roles well i have mention kalyanji anandji who were behind all totally cool music throughout movie background music songs are made match coolness movie d lata kishore asha at their ultimate cool so watch this cool movie so i can stop using word cool so much hehe khaike paan banaras wala,0.6198656898656897,0.15674603174603174,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.38, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.25}"
,great classic,Don is a great film its different to other most indian films. Right from the start the first thing that thrills you about this film is the dynamic title music. Its so inspiring and puts you in a good mood for rest of the film. Amitabh's acting is good as allways and his acting from serious to comedy to serious is super. Zeenat Aman is a tough cat in this. I reccomend young people to watch AB movies they are entertaining just as they were when they was first released. Good supporting cast from Pran. Strong role of Iftikar and that sexy Helen doing best for what she's good at.The fight scene at the end is well performed and executed. The same music returns and blends well with the action. I give this film 7/10,great classic,don is great film its different other most indian films right start first thing that thrills you about this film is dynamic title music its so inspiring puts you good mood rest film amitabhs acting is good as allways his acting serious comedy serious is super zeenat aman is tough cat this i reccomend young people watch ab movies they are entertaining just as they were when they was first released good supporting cast pran strong role iftikar that sexy helen doing best what shes good at fight scene at end is well performed executed same music returns blends well with action i give this film 7 10,0.49490968801313623,0.28925834701696773,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.36, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
7.0,"Very good but the ending is very, very, very weak.","""Don"" is a film about a mobster called the Don (Amitabh Bachchan). He's a cold and dangerous man and specializes in blowing up his enemies. And, the guy is also very slippery and the police keep missing him. However, eventually, DSP D'Silva manages to kill the Don--but he has the guy buried in secret. Neither the police nor the criminals realize the Don is dead because D'Silva knows someone who looks exactly like the Don* and plans on substituting him. So, he creates a plausible story--that the Don was hurt so badly that his memory is temporarily impaired. However, Vijay doesn't realize that his impersonating the Don has two major problems--a woman in the mob is planning on killing the Don and what would happen if D'Silva was killed and they couldn't prove that Vijay WASN'T the Don! Tune in to see what's next.The story is interesting and worth seeing up until the end. Unfortunately, the end is terrible--and almost slapstick. Seeing the disabled guy fighting so ably was silly as was the use of slide-whistles whenever folks did flips--and they did MORE flips than you'd see in the Summer Olympics! Badly choreographed and silly--it makes the film slip from a 9 to a 7.",very good but ending is very very very weak,don is film about mobster called don amitabh bachchan hes cold dangerous man specializes blowing up his enemies guy is also very slippery police keep missing him however eventually dsp dsilva manages kill don but he has guy buried secret neither police nor criminals realize don is dead because dsilva knows someone who looks exactly like don plans substituting him so he creates plausible story that don was hurt so badly that his memory is temporarily impaired however vijay doesnt realize that his impersonating don has two major problems woman mob is planning killing don what would happen if dsilva was killed they couldnt prove that vijay wasnt don tune see whats next story is interesting worth seeing up until end unfortunately end is terrible almost slapstick seeing disabled guy fighting so ably was silly as was use slide whistles whenever folks did flips they did more flips than youd see summer olympics badly choreographed silly it makes film slip 9 7,0.5542013888888889,-0.12770833333333334,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Perfect entertainment for all ages....and all times!!,"Don review :Knock knock! ""Who's it?"" inquires a voice hiding in a hotel room. ""DON!"" declares his assertive boss from the other end. The guy understands his end is near and flees the hotel in a Kaali peeli cab. Unfortunately, he's been framed and the Don (Amitabh Bachchan) reveals himself to him. It's a scene which highlights the towering importance of its titular character. 'Don' as he is simply called. No more, no less...Amitabh Bachchan played this dreaded gangster as well as his adorable 'bhaiyya' doppelganger Vijay fantastically enough to clinch his second Filmfare trophy.The legendary Salim Javed's plot was simple : There's this bad guy called Don. He dies and is replaced by a desi commoner to infiltrate his gang. Inspired by the black & white Shammi Kapoor starrer 'China Town' (1962), Don worked and believe me, it worked big time (75 weeks of uninterrupted run in theatres) only due to the charisma of its lead actor - Amitabh Bachchan and the last minute addition - 'Khaike Pan Banaraswala', a song rejected by Dev Anand Saahab for his film 'Banarasi Babu' (1973)...Zeenat Aman (my childhood crush) and Pran Saahab played the perfect foil and the portly Om Shivpuri provided the Kahaani mein twist factor. In short, Don offered perfect entertainment for all ages ...and all times.The classic was remade successfully in 2006 with SRK in lead. It might be remade again after a couple of decades. But Chandra Barot's attempt cannot be bettered. No way. Never!!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni.",perfect entertainment all ages all times,don review knock knock whos it inquires voice hiding hotel room don declares his assertive boss other end guy understands his end is near flees hotel kaali peeli cab unfortunately hes been framed don amitabh bachchan reveals himself him its scene which highlights towering importance its titular character don as he is simply called no more no less amitabh bachchan played this dreaded gangster as well as his adorable bhaiyya doppelganger vijay fantastically enough clinch his second filmfare trophy legendary salim javeds plot was simple theres this bad guy called don he dies is replaced by desi commoner infiltrate his gang inspired by black white shammi kapoor starrer china town 1962 don worked believe me it worked big time 75 weeks uninterrupted run theatres only due charisma its lead actor amitabh bachchan last minute addition khaike pan banaraswala song rejected by dev anand saahab his film banarasi babu 1973 zeenat aman my childhood crush pran saahab played perfect foil portly om shivpuri provided kahaani mein twist factor short don offered perfect entertainment all ages all times classic was remade successfully 2006 with srk lead it might be remade again after couple decades but chandra barots attempt cannot be bettered no way never regards sumeet nadkarni,0.489010989010989,0.14743589743589744,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,"Great style, great Bachchan, and hardly a dull moment","Don is a true classic thriller of the 1970s, and it surpasses the usual fare of the times in both story and execution. The film is extremely well shot, and Chandra Barot's direction is very good. The film gave me Bond vibes as I was watching it - everything about it from very early in the film is really stylish, the camera work is great, the sets, decorations, costumes, score, sound - everything boasts of very high production values. What makes the magic in the end is the script, which is tense and twisted and really well etched out, and, guess what else, oh, well, who else if not Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, who is excellent in his dual roles, and his presence alone does much to captivate the viewers. What almost takes away from the magic is the ending, which turns the film into a sort of slapstick comedy, unintentionally I guess, but it is forgivable because most films of the genre end on similar notes. The film has many other great things going for it, including great music, a lovely leading lady in Zeenat Aman, and impressive turns from the famous character actors Pran and Iftekhar. There's hardly a dull moment in this film. It's nostalgic and highly entertaining.",great style great bachchan hardly dull moment,don is true classic thriller 1970s it surpasses usual fare times both story execution film is extremely well shot chandra barots direction is very good film gave me bond vibes as i was watching it everything about it very early film is really stylish camera work is great sets decorations costumes score sound everything boasts very high production values what makes magic end is script which is tense twisted really well etched out guess what else oh well who else if not mr amitabh bachchan who is excellent his dual roles his presence alone does much captivate viewers what almost takes away magic is ending which turns film into sort slapstick comedy unintentionally i guess but it is forgivable because most films genre end similar notes film has many other great things going it including great music lovely leading lady zeenat aman impressive turns famous character actors pran iftekhar theres hardly dull moment this film its nostalgic highly entertaining,0.6629270833333333,0.31712500000000005,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10.0,AB is the best!!!,"This is another classic movie by Bachchan. The range of acting that he shows in this movie is amazing. I have seen no other actor do that without changing the look extensively. Basically he portrays three different characters in the movie. One is stylish and loathsome Don, second is endearing beatle-chewing street singer, and third of the goofy impostor of Don. AB proves he is the best actor ever. The music rocks. And Zeenat looked the coolest ever. The whole plot is interesting and entertaining. Every character has an important part. Don is the cult movie today just because of Amitabh and its music. The opening scene with Amitabh wearing yellow shades is too cool and the casting music outstanding.",ab is best,this is another classic movie by bachchan range acting that he shows this movie is amazing i have seen no other actor do that without changing look extensively basically he portrays three different characters movie one is stylish loathsome don second is endearing beatle chewing street singer third goofy impostor don ab proves he is best actor ever music rocks zeenat looked coolest ever whole plot is interesting entertaining every character has important part don is cult movie today just because amitabh its music opening scene with amitabh wearing yellow shades is too cool casting music outstanding,0.4571428571428572,0.3371031746031746,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.37}"

7.0,Superb entertainer,"Amitabh by late 70s had become a reigning force overtaking everyone else, In 1978 he gave back to back 4 big hits like Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Trishul and Kasme Vaade, This may not be as dramatic as the earlier ones yet it's a great entertainer and works well as a thriller. The basic premise is similar to Shakti Samantha's China Town(1962) and Shatrughan Sinha starrer Kalicharan(1976)but yet it's a good film The film took a long time to complete and the producer Nariman's untimely death caused it quite some losses, finally it was released and to everyone's surprise it not only became a big hit but is also remembered till today. Strangely, Amitabh played a dual role in Kasme Vaade too. The film starts off superbly, Don's scenes are superb especially the famous dialogue Don Ko Pakadna which is recalled even today. Don's sudden death does come as a surprise and then Vijay's entry is superb and the going-ons get enjoyable when Vijay enters the gang as Don. There are several brilliant chases, action scenes though which may belong to the 70s but yet work well. The drama towards the second half when Vijay finds himself in a mess are superb. Though the film does tend to drag in the second half, also there are some stupid scenes like Pran walking on the rope and the entire climax which looks too funny, Yet in all fairness, the film keeps you entertained. The film was different compared to films made in 70s, It didn't have maa beta, no high pitched dramatic scenes. Direction by Chandra Barot who didn't do a film after this, is superb Music is a superhit and most of the songs are still remembered today Kalyanji Anandji score yet again, Kishore Kumar and Amitabh Jodi is superb here too, be it the title song, Jiska Mujhe Tha(with Asha), Khaike Paan and Yeh Hai Bambai, Asha also does a superb job in Yeh Mera Dil Camera-work is good, Dialogues are superbAmitabh Bachchan proves his versatility by portraying both the roles superbly, he is superb as DON while as Vijay too he excels, Something Srk couldn't succeed in the remake, Being from Allahabad himself, his bhojpuri accent works well.

4.0,Movie with logical flaws !!!,"Loved this movie when I was in school and dozen odd times it was shown on TV. However logic since then has taken off the shine of the movie for me. It is true audience back in the 70/80's were quite naive and would blindly gobble up anything served up by the movie makers. One rope scene stands out like a sore thumb. JJ (Pran) who is disabled in one leg needing a cane to walk on plain surfaces, easily walks on a tightrope while escaping the bad guys. In addition he is holding 2 kids in his hands, when Shetty (henchman) cuts the rope, the falling Pran conveniently is able to grab the rope and climb down to safety (If he had kids in his hands how would that be possible in that split second?). The impossibility of this gravity defying feat makes any rational thinking person laugh out uncontrollably. Secondly when Vardhan impersonating an Interpol officer (Malik) becomes part of the policing team, no verification of his identity is conducted.

8.0,Watch it for superstar Big B,"This film isn't the greatest to ever hit bollywood, nor it is a path breaking film for the industry. Don is a genuine entertainer with an interesting storyline for the 70s era. They could have spent half the film showing the notorious don but instead the character dies soon, and later is replaced by a look-a-like. Which is where we get plenty of laughter and light moments. Towards the end when he is discovered by the police to be a fake Don, he is in a big soup. It is interesting how he manages to prove himself innocent, and how he find the father of the kids he was taking care of. Easily said, Hindi films are generally made up of lots of coincidences and this film is no exception. This is one movie where the female lead is not just used to provide sexual and love interest but Zeenat Aman gets plenty of footage with her martial arts and action scenes. The remake of Don by Farhan Akhtar in 2006 is bound to collect some brickbats, but I believe his movie will be a high-tech thriller compared to the old retro version.",watch it superstar big b,this film isnt greatest ever hit bollywood nor it is path breaking film industry don is genuine entertainer with interesting storyline 70s era they could have spent half film showing notorious don but instead character dies soon later is replaced by look like which is where we get plenty laughter light moments towards end when he is discovered by police be fake don he is big soup it is interesting how he manages prove himself innocent how he find father kids he was taking care easily said hindi films are generally made up lots coincidences this film is no exception this is one movie where female lead is not just used provide sexual love interest but zeenat aman gets plenty footage with her martial arts action scenes remake don by farhan akhtar 2006 is bound collect some brickbats but i believe his movie will be high tech thriller compared old retro version,0.4352380952380951,0.20841269841269838,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,A classic Bachchan film,"I saw the movie as a freshman in college and fell in love with this action thriller. It has every ingredient to keep the audience enthralled. It is fast paced with an amazing background score that you want to hear again and again. I still cannot get enough of the beginning of the film and its opening credits. It is just mind blowing.Amitabh Bachchan, what can I say about this great actor. I love every aspect of him be it his hairstyle, intense manner of speaking or his dignified appearance in so many films such as K3G, Baghban and Deewaar (1975). In the case of Don Amitji gives a lot of life to the character he plays. He is larger than life in so many films and Don is a classic example. He has amazing screen presence and his dialogue delivery is the best in the business. To sum it Amitji is a great actor who has enthralled billions of fans around the world and I am one of them. I admire him immensely.Other cast members do a very fine job. Zeenat Aman is sheer movie magic. Hats off to the cast and crew of the entire film which was very ahead of its times in the 70s. Music is wonderful especially yeh mera dil and kaike paan.This classic cannot be beaten by any remake such as the 2006 version starring King Khan.

8.0,"Well acted, and well directed","By Indian Bollywood standards, a very great movie. I saw it when I was a kid, and have been enamored ever since.Amitabh plays the role of his life, no doubt. The direction by Chandra Barot is stellar, and his knowledge and use of camera angles is extraordinary.If someone had told me that Salim Javed believed it to be a ""breakfast script,"" I would not have believed it. However, on closer look, one can see why.There are many bloopers in the movie that go unnoticed because of the fast pace of the movie...you don't think when you are watching it.Here are some:1. The car that Amitabh arrives in before he is accosted by the police is not the one he drives away in. And there is no way the ""Herbie"" like car can be a police car that he tries to escape in.2. The police inspector Iftikhar says the diary reveals that the leader is Vardhan, but it does not contain info on the address. However, Pran has no issues finding the address to Vardhan's place later in the movie. In fact Pran's dialog goes, ""doosra bekaar sawaal.""3. The police never bother to check on Amitabh the fake Don's claim about the children in St. Teresa Bandra...if they had done so, the fake Don would not be a fugitive during the latter half of the movie.4. When the prisoners are being transfered from one prison to another, they are not in handcuffs. Why they don't break the door and just run away is anybody's guess, but the fight between Amitabh and Shetty inside the van is well done...kudos to Chandra Barot on the camera work.However, the above apart, a great, great movie experience. I am not sure why it called a cult movie, because it is universally liked.The things well done: 1. Amitabh escapes in one dress from the police van and is always wearing that dress...it shows he's a fugitive.2. The way the real ""mole"" is hidden is done very well and heightens the suspense.All I can say is, enjoy the movie, not once but again, and again.Paddy",well acted well directed,by indian bollywood standards very great movie i saw it when i was kid have been enamored ever since amitabh plays role his life no doubt direction by chandra barot is stellar his knowledge use camera angles is extraordinary if someone had told me that salim javed believed it be breakfast script i would not have believed it however closer look one can see why there are many bloopers movie that go unnoticed because fast pace movie you dont think when you are watching it here are some 1 car that amitabh arrives before he is accosted by police is not one he drives away there is no way herbie like car can be police car that he tries escape 2 police inspector iftikhar says diary reveals that leader is vardhan but it does not contain info address however pran has no issues finding address vardhans place later movie fact prans dialog goes doosra bekaar sawaal 3 police never bother check amitabh fake dons claim about children st teresa bandra if they had done so fake don would not be fugitive during latter half movie 4 when prisoners are being transfered one prison another they are not handcuffs why they dont break door just run away is anybodys guess but fight between amitabh shetty inside van is well done kudos chandra barot camera work however above apart great great movie experience i am not sure why it called cult movie because it is universally liked things well done 1 amitabh escapes one dress police van is always wearing that dress it shows hes fugitive 2 way real mole is hidden is done very well heightens suspense all i can say is enjoy movie not once but again again paddy,0.5339947089947091,0.1619047619047619,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,An all time great!,"This is what you call a classic 70s Bollywood crime drama. No Bollywood movie in the genre had neither the might nor the ability to be as great as this one. I definitely don't think that everything was purely original, some chase scenes and action scenes do feel like as if they were influenced by some Hollywood movies of that era. But whatever the case might be, I don't think there's a doubt regarding the fact it's one hell of a movie.First and foremost - Amitabh Bachchan - that too in his prime - perfect choice for the role. Years later, even SRK tried it and didn't really give a performance par that of Bachchan. Bachchan is incredible as both Don and Vijay. Not only he portrays both the characters in the most accurate way possible, we can clearly see his versatility as an actor through these roles. Don is a heartless and a subtle criminal with every sort of negative vibe to him. Vijay is a goof who tries to act like Don. Both of these contrasting characters have been played by Bachchan with an ease. Pran as JJ was equally great. Whenever Bachchan and him meet in this movie, something quite exciting happens. They are one of the most dynamic duos of the era, and in general, of entire Bollywood.Om Shiv Puri does a nice job as officer Mallik. Rest of the cast were fine on the whole. Coming to the story, there are two or three major plotlines which form the entire plot of the movie. One of my major concern was about Pran's plotline and felt it would not mesh with the rest of the plot. But it never happened. It wasn't messed up at all. The twists and turns are quite unpredictable and really entertaining when they come.Except for Bachchan being forced to act in a comedic way just for the sake of some unwanted laugh, nothing is bad about this movie. It's an amazingly entertaining film that'll give you thrills and make you laugh at the same time. I have probably seen it over 100 times since the first time I watched it 16 years ago, and I am still entertained by the movie in the same way like I was when I watched it for the first time (may be even more). It's an absolutely well made film with several memorable scenes, dialogues and sequences. One of the greatest movies from the 70s, and of Amitabh Bachchan's career.Rating : absolute 10/10, Grade : golden A+",all time great,this is what you call classic 70s bollywood crime drama no bollywood movie genre had neither might nor ability be as great as this one i definitely dont think that everything was purely original some chase scenes action scenes do feel like as if they were influenced by some hollywood movies that era but whatever case might be i dont think theres doubt regarding fact its one hell movie first foremost amitabh bachchan that too his prime perfect choice role years later even srk tried it didnt really give performance par that bachchan bachchan is incredible as both don vijay not only he portrays both characters most accurate way possible we can clearly see his versatility as actor through these roles don is heartless subtle criminal with every sort negative vibe him vijay is goof who tries act like don both these contrasting characters have been played by bachchan with ease pran as jj was equally great whenever bachchan him meet this movie something quite exciting happens they are one most dynamic duos era general entire bollywood om shiv puri does nice job as officer mallik rest cast were fine whole coming story there are two or three major plotlines which form entire plot movie one my major concern was about prans plotline felt it would not mesh with rest plot but it never happened it wasnt messed up at all twists turns are quite unpredictable really entertaining when they come except bachchan being forced act comedic way just sake some unwanted laugh nothing is bad about this movie its amazingly entertaining film thatll give you thrills make you laugh at same time i have probably seen it over 100 times since first time i watched it 16 years ago i am still entertained by movie same way like i was when i watched it first time may be even more its absolutely well made film with several memorable scenes dialogues sequences one greatest movies 70s amitabh bachchans career rating absolute 10 10 grade golden,0.5373333333333332,0.22166666666666665,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"

Amitabh Bachchan is very good in both his roles. The film is hurt by its modest budget but rises above it by focusing on histrionics. Pran has a great role as a circus performer. Zeenat Aman provides the glamor element. The soundtrack is still very popular and was partially copied in the Shahrukh remake. While the remake is admittedly stylish and with better production values, Amitabh's 'Don' remains more entertaining to watch.Overall 7/10",campy entertainer with fun songs fine performances,this much loved thriller is rated very highly by most people i enjoyed it great deal too but more as campy entertainer with fun songs amitabh bachchan is very good both his roles film is hurt by its modest budget but rises above it by focusing histrionics pran has great role as circus performer zeenat aman provides glamor element soundtrack is still very popular was partially copied shahrukh remake while remake is admittedly stylish with better production values amitabhs don remains more entertaining watch overall 7 10,0.5621052631578948,0.4477192982456141,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.67, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.0}"
8.0,The Real Don - Smart ! Cunning ! Dangerous !,"Seventies were the decade of crime-thrillers in Bollywood when a plethora of such movies were presented to the audience. Among them Don (1978) is a milestone movie which demonstrated what a quality crime-thriller is all about. It enhanced the popularity of already very popular Angry Young Man of India - Amitabh Bachchan.The word Don (perhaps) traces its origin to Don Vito Corleone of the classic work of Mario Puzo - The Godfather. However it's the Hindi movie Don which coined this term in the world of Indian fiction (both movies and books), rendering its meaning as a gangster.The hero of this movie is an international criminal Don (Amitabh Bachchan) who leads a smugglers' gang but himself works for another gangster Vardhaan. It's Don who remains in limelight and being chased by the police whereas very little is known about Vardhaan. Don is a very smart, cunning, dangerous and ruthless criminal who is very difficult to be got better of.However one day, this high profile and domineering gangster gets killed in a police encounter. However except the encountering police officer Mr. D' Silva (Iftekhaar), nobody knows that Don has died. Mr. D' Silva decides to take advantage of this situation as he knows a look-alike of Don whose name is Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan in another role). He ensures Vijay's entry to the gang of smugglers as their boss, i.e., Don so that the complete network of the smuggling activity can be caught by the law. In the gang, Vijay presents himself as Don to the members of the gang and stealthily keeps on searching significant information about the activities and links of the gang.Vijay has to remain wary of a girl Roma (Zeenat Aman) who is an expert in judo and karate and Jasjeet (Pran) who is a handicapped person because both of them are hell-bent upon settling their respective scores with Don. He comes to know of the existence of some Vardhaan whom Don and his gang works for but nothing is known about him. He wants to provide all the relevant information to Mr. D' Silva so that a huge police action could be carried out against the gang. However the sudden demise of Mr. D' Silva puts Vijay in deep trouble as now he is not able to prove before the law and the society that he's not Don because Mr. D' Silva was the only person knowing his real identity. The action-packed climax paves the way for Vijay's redemption once Vardhaan is unmasked.This highly entertaining and very well made movie inspired many movies to be made later viz. Daav-Pech (1989) starring Jeetendra in lead role and Madam X (1994) starring Rekha in lead role. Farhaan Akhtar straightaway made its remake in 2006 starring Shah Rukh Khan in lead role. Many other movies which did not lift the whole story of Don, also used certain ingredients of it. Meri Aawaaz Suno (1981) is also one such movie in which Jeetendra has played the lead role. But very few people know that the writers of Don - Salim-Jaaved themselves had written it by seeking inspiration from Shakti Saamanta's China Town (1962) in which Shammi Kapoor has played the lead role.Don is a fast-paced thriller with ample doses of comedy through the character of Vijay who impersonates Don. Right from the opening scene which establishes the title character as a bold, cunning, sharp-minded and authoritarian individual before the audience to the climax, the whole movie proves to be completely engrossing for any viewer. There is no moment of boredom in the movie and both the script and the direction (by Chandra Barot) have done complete justice to the original story idea. Salim-Jaaved used to write dialogs also and they have written impressive dialogs in sync with their script.Kalyanji Anandji have composed very good music for this movie containing the chartbuster as well as still very popular songs like Khai Ke Paan Banaraswaala, Arre Deewano Mujhe Pehchaano, Jiska Mujhe Tha Intezaar, Ye Mera Dil Pyar Ka Deewaana and Ee Hai Bambai Nagariya Tu Dekh Babua. These songs are counted among the all time popular songs of Kishore Kumar, Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar.Technically, this movie is up to the mark with all the action and thrills being very good according to the norms of that period, good cinematography and art direction, effective background score and razor-sharp editing.All the principal characters have done justice to their roles and left their mark may it be very smart Zeenat Aman or the seasoned actor Pran or the villains or the actors like Iftekhaar and Helen whose roles have their own significance in the story. Who can forget Helen's performance on Ye Mera Dil Pyar Ka Deewaana ? And finally, Don is a memorable movie mainly because of Amitabh Bachchan. Nobody could do this role better than AB. His tall personality with the God-given extra-ordinary voice make him the ideal choice for the domineering role of Don. He looks like a real don who is chased by the police of many countries. The remakes of Don could not be as impressive as the original version because no other actor doing this role possessed such an extra-ordinary personality. Big B has delivered an unforgettable performance in the roles of sturdy Don and jolly Vijay.This movie is so impressive and carries such a high entertainment value that its being a blockbuster is not at all surprising. It has been re-released many times and it is capable of rocking the box office if released in theatres once more.",real don smart cunning dangerous,seventies were decade crime thrillers bollywood when plethora such movies were presented audience among them don 1978 is milestone movie which demonstrated what quality crime thriller is all about it enhanced popularity already very popular angry young man india amitabh bachchan word don perhaps traces its origin don vito corleone classic work mario puzo godfather however its hindi movie don which coined this term world indian fiction both movies books rendering its meaning as gangster hero this movie is international criminal don amitabh bachchan who leads smugglers gang but himself works another gangster vardhaan its don who remains limelight being chased by police whereas very little is known about vardhaan don is very smart cunning dangerous ruthless criminal who is very difficult be got better however one day this high profile domineering gangster gets killed police encounter however except encountering police officer mr d silva iftekhaar nobody knows that don has died mr d silva decides take advantage this situation as he knows look alike don whose name is vijay amitabh bachchan another role he ensures vijays entry gang smugglers as their boss i e don so that complete network smuggling activity can be caught by law gang vijay presents himself as don members gang stealthily keeps searching significant information about activities links gang vijay has remain wary girl roma zeenat aman who is expert judo karate jasjeet pran who is handicapped person because both them are hell bent upon settling their respective scores with don he comes know existence some vardhaan whom don his gang works but nothing is known about him he wants provide all relevant information mr d silva so that huge police action could be carried out against gang however sudden demise mr d silva puts vijay deep trouble as now he is not able prove before law society that hes not don because mr d silva was only person knowing his real identity action packed climax paves way vijays redemption once vardhaan is unmasked this highly entertaining very well made movie inspired many movies be made later viz daav pech 1989 starring jeetendra lead role madam x 1994 starring rekha lead role farhaan akhtar straightaway made its remake 2006 starring shah rukh khan lead role many other movies which did not lift whole story don also used certain ingredients it meri aawaaz suno 1981 is also one such movie which jeetendra has played lead role but very few people know that writers don salim jaaved themselves had written it by seeking inspiration shakti saamantas china town 1962 which shammi kapoor has played lead role don is fast paced thriller with ample doses comedy through character vijay who impersonates don right opening scene which establishes title character as bold cunning sharp minded authoritarian individual before audience climax whole movie proves be completely engrossing any viewer there is no moment boredom movie both script direction by chandra barot have done complete justice original story idea salim jaaved used write dialogs also they have written impressive dialogs sync with their script kalyanji anandji have composed very good music this movie containing chartbuster as well as still very popular songs like khai ke paan banaraswaala arre deewano mujhe pehchaano jiska mujhe tha intezaar ye mera dil pyar ka deewaana ee hai bambai nagariya tu dekh babua these songs are counted among all time popular songs kishore kumar asha bhosle lata mangeshkar technically this movie is up mark with all action thrills being very good according norms that period good cinematography art direction effective background score razor sharp editing all principal characters have done justice their roles left their mark may it be very smart zeenat aman or seasoned actor pran or villains or actors like iftekhaar helen whose roles have their own significance story who can forget helens performance ye mera dil pyar ka deewaana finally don is memorable movie mainly because amitabh bachchan nobody could do this role better than ab his tall personality with god given extra ordinary voice make him ideal choice domineering role don he looks like real don who is chased by police many countries remakes don could not be as impressive as original version because no other actor doing this role possessed such extra ordinary personality big b has delivered unforgettable performance roles sturdy don jolly vijay this movie is so impressive carries such high entertainment value that its being blockbuster is not at all surprising it has been re released many times it is capable rocking box office if released theatres once more,0.5506115288220552,0.1778615288220551,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.41}"

But then D'Silva gets killed, and everyone from the gangsters to the cops think Vijay is Don. If he can't convince them otherwise, it may prove fatal.No can do a better job as Don than Amitabh Bachchan - the original Don. As the gangster, he's laconic, cool, cold and utters the one liners with utter cool detachment. It's an iconic role that he was born to do, and his role of the pan eating doppelgänger is hilarious. Just shows how versatile he is. Zeenat Aman and Pran are also brilliant.The plot is tight, gripping with enough suspense and thrills to keep you glued.

9.0,Knock Knock Don,"Review By Kamal KDon (1978), is not perfect. But I didn't want anything else afterward, and customer satisfaction has to count for something, right?Just when I was starting to think I knew what to expect from Hindi movies of the 70's, ""Don"" comes along and tricks my brain into a buying into whole different level of entertainment. To be honest, it was probably all the better because I was expecting something tired and worn, for whatever reason. You know what they say, ""Expectation, Expectation, Expectation.""
