10,SUPERBLY CRAFTED!,"This is not a film where the friends characters are just in the backgeound laughing for hero's jokes and just shedding few tears in emotional scenes, they play a very important role and carey the film on their shoulders! The performances are just mind blowing, after so long Shraddha kapoor has got a chance to show what she is. Sushanth is wonderful in his role, and the film also touches few social topics and leaves you with a message. The dialogues and college episodes are just mindblowing and it brings you laughs. You laugh so much that you no more care about the world. The director runs the screenplay of the past and the present simultaneously which is really fresh on the film. The sports episodes are also picturised in a clean way instead of adding a cinematic feel into it.

8,It's time to shrug off the underdog tag!,"Chhichhore - Indian films have now come of age, they can give a message subtly without being preachy. Chhichhore begins with young Raghav suffering from a massive anxiety about whether he will crack the all India engineering entrance exam as he has invested 18 hours a day for the past many months preparing for it and wants to match the caliber of his parents.A failure to launch throws him into despair and the occasion brings together six middle aged people into a reunion with the objective of alleviating Raghav from his pain and encouraging him to bring hope back into his fragile life. LOSERS, as these six were known as in their student life, recount their carefree journey initially and the final effort to shrug off the underdog tag, drawing a significant parallel to Raghav's situation.Director Nitesh Tiwari handles the subject with sensitivity and balances the Losers journey through the undergraduate years well. There was ample temptation available to propel this segment of the film into being an over the top and loud essay, but Tiwari never gives in, thus rising above the ordinary. Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an underrated performance and Tahir Raj Bhasin adds gravitas. Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Kumar Shukla add to the little masala with their individual contribution, but the star of the Losers union must be Varun Sharma. He is absolutely a laugh riot with his expressions, one liners and an incredible energy, cracking up the theatre on numerous occasions. The weakest link is yet again Shraddha Kapoor, who needs to experiment with diversity of histrionic capabilities and expressions.Don't miss Chhichhore, it's a fantastic mood lifter and easy on the mind, often drawing you into the proceedings.",its time shrug off underdog tag,chhichhore indian films have now come age they can give message subtly without being preachy chhichhore begins with young raghav suffering massive anxiety about whether he will crack all india engineering entrance exam as he has invested 18 hours day past many months preparing it wants match caliber his parents failure launch throws him into despair occasion brings together six middle aged people into reunion with objective alleviating raghav his pain encouraging him bring hope back into his fragile life losers as these six were known as their student life recount their carefree journey initially final effort shrug off underdog tag drawing significant parallel raghavs situation director nitesh tiwari handles subject with sensitivity balances losers journey through undergraduate years well there was ample temptation available propel this segment film into being over top loud essay but tiwari never gives thus rising above ordinary sushant singh rajput delivers underrated performance tahir raj bhasin adds gravitas naveen polishetty tushar pandey saharsh kumar shukla add little masala with their individual contribution but star losers union must be varun sharma he is absolutely laugh riot with his expressions one liners incredible energy cracking up theatre numerous occasions weakest link is yet again shraddha kapoor who needs experiment with diversity histrionic capabilities expressions dont miss chhichhore its fantastic mood lifter easy mind often drawing you into proceedings,0.42473958333333334,0.05638020833333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.34, 'Fear': 0.42}"

8,EVOCATIVE!,"#FinalVerdictA film of impeccable pedigree, a breezy entertainer with its heart in the right place! Director Nitesh Tiwari is truly working at the height of his creative powers. Sterling!You expect the moon from this Fox Star Studios and Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment's production as far as the entertainment goes because it's Nitesh Tiwari's next release after Dangal. Let me make it clear right away. There are films & there are more films and then there's Chhichhore. It can be rightly termed as a slice of life film. Nitesh Tiwari understands the intricacies of human behaviour & strives to deftly integrate authentic characters & bona fide situations on celluloid. Technically too, the product is first-rate.The initial reels are full of light moments & keep the viewer in splits with witty one-liners. More than the story, it is the screenplay (Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta & Nikhil Mehrotra) that should be talked about. You will be high on nostalgia for sure!👍👍One more thing! You cannot draw parallels with any other film, past or present, successful or unsuccessful. If masala means entertainment, amusement, hilarity, escapade, emotions and drama, yes, Chhichhore has it all. Only thing, it's treated differently!Every person behind the camera gives his/her best to the film. Amalendu Chaudhary's exquisite cinematography is another aspect that catches your attention. The feel of the film has been cut, compiled & presented with dexterity by editor Charu Shree Roy. Nimble-fingered!Pritam's music perfectly grows on you after you've watched the film. Sameer Uddin's background score uplifts the overall mood. Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics leave an impression. And the best is reserved for the last - Mukesh Chhabra's casting is spot on!Chhichhore boasts of an exuberant on-screen ensemble cast. As a matter of fact, it's an unusual mix of actors & they unequivocally shine collectively. Together, as a group of friends, they have an easy camaraderie that's easily relatable. Sushant Singh Rajput is blessed with wonderful screen presence & gets the timing of his character right. Watch out for him in the scene where he goes tongue-tied in front of Maya. Shraddha Kapoor emotes with utmost conviction, proving her mettle as an actress of substance. Varun Sharma is superb in his comic timing. His appearance, mannerisms & dialogue delivery are exemplary. Tahir Raj Bhasin portrays the role with plentiful charm & magnetism. Naveen Polishetty is quite a scene-stealer on more occasions than one. Excellent!Prateik Babbar's registers a strong impact despite the small role. Tushar Pandey plays to the gallery & delivers a sparkling performance. Saharsh Kumar is in terrific form & portrays his role with precision. Chhichhore belongs to everyone. Copybook!On the whole, Chhichhore is brimming with solid content with a relevant message. Watch it for the spirit it is made in. Sometimes, we laugh at movies. At times, we laugh in movies. Chhichhore belongs to the latter type.

Sometimes, it seemed out of control. But believe me, it'll be still on the right track till the end. The performances of lead cast was also just okay, not that great.

9,A mixture of good elements from 3 Idiots and Students of the year 1.,"Story: A movie with a critical message that either you win or lose, life can't be replaced by anything. This message has been conveyed in an engaging and enjoyable manner.Screenplay: This movie gives the nostalgic feel about college life. Screenplay does engage well in its first half. But got little slow in its second half, it's because the message should be effectively conveyed. However the message is effectively conveyed.Music: Background score by Pritam was good. But, out of 3 songs, 2 songs are good. Background music helped a lot to make us involved with the movie.Acting: It's definitely the best movie in the career of Sushant Singh Rajput and the best movie of Shraddha Kapoor after Aashiqui 2 and ek villain. Their acting is absolutely awesome and make us connect with the movie emotionally. Varun Sharma as usual made us laugh with his one liners. Prateik Babbar though underutilized, done his part well. Other casts have also performed well.Dialogues: The best part of the movie, which makes us emotional was its dialogues. Though old, the dialogues are awesome.Overall, a nostalgic film that can't be any better.*My Rating: 4.5/5*",mixture good elements 3 idiots students year 1,story movie with critical message that either you win or lose life cant be replaced by anything this message has been conveyed engaging enjoyable manner screenplay this movie gives nostalgic feel about college life screenplay does engage well its first half but got little slow its second half its because message should be effectively conveyed however message is effectively conveyed music background score by pritam was good but out 3 songs 2 songs are good background music helped lot make us involved with movie acting its definitely best movie career sushant singh rajput best movie shraddha kapoor after aashiqui 2 ek villain their acting is absolutely awesome make us connect with movie emotionally varun sharma as usual made us laugh with his one liners prateik babbar though underutilized done his part well other casts have also performed well dialogues best part movie which makes us emotional was its dialogues though old dialogues are awesome overall nostalgic film that cant be any better my rating 4 5 5,0.48156565656565664,0.24709595959595954,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.28}"

Nonetheless the movie is a great and must watch. If you have lived in a hostel or you have spent a lot of great times with your friends, you can find moments to relate yourself.

5,Too many clichés spoil the viewing experience! [+46%],"This is the kind of feel-good, message-filled cinema that a vast majority of Indians have grown to love. It's cinema in its most easily digestible form - light-hearted, breezy, predictable, and filled with melodrama. When viewed as the second directorial attempt of Nitesh Tiwari, the man behind India's biggest blockbuster 'Dangal', one can only let out an impromptu sigh at the end of this 145-minute long affair.'Chhichhore', at best, feels like a rehashed '3 Idiots' with a bit of an expanded universe. Unfortunately, it lacks the charm of the latter even when it had much older actors playing the role of college teens. Here too, the lengthy flashback sequences come soaked in nostalgia. What works against the movie is that these fun-filled moments are intercut with the scenario of a young student who is in the hospital in a terrible physical and mental state after having attempted suicide. So, there's a constant switching on and off of emotions.While there is, of course, a novel idea hidden in there somewhere, it gets lost amid everything else that happens. Nitesh has already proven (with 'Dangal') that he can handle sports sequences well and he doesn't let the viewers down in that department, however predictable they turn out to be. It's surprising to me that the supporting cast (comprising of Varun Sharma, Naveen Polishetty, Tahir Raj Bhasin, and Saharsh Kumar Shukla) has done a much better job here than the lead duo (Sushant, who is usually pretty good, and Shraddha Kapoor, who is yet to impress me acting-wise) and it's their nuances that are comparatively more memorable.For what it is, 'Chhichhore' doesn't require its viewers to overwork their brains. In essence, it's the equivalent of eating Maggi noodles. It gives you instant energy, but not much beyond. If you can deal with a certain level of cringe-worthy clichés, then 'Chhichhore' could very well up your alley. Looking at the 8+ rating, I realize that our audiences still buy into anything that offers a decent dose of nostalgia, even if it's not the most competently written/made.Verdict: Throwaway watch!",too many clich s spoil viewing experience,this is kind feel good message filled cinema that vast majority indians have grown love its cinema its most easily digestible form light hearted breezy predictable filled with melodrama when viewed as second directorial attempt nitesh tiwari man behind indias biggest blockbuster dangal one can only let out impromptu sigh at end this 145 minute long affair chhichhore at best feels like rehashed 3 idiots with bit expanded universe unfortunately it lacks charm latter even when it had much older actors playing role college teens here too lengthy flashback sequences come soaked nostalgia what works against movie is that these fun filled moments are intercut with scenario young student who is hospital terrible physical mental state after having attempted suicide so theres constant switching off emotions while there is course novel idea hidden there somewhere it gets lost amid everything else that happens nitesh has already proven with dangal that he can handle sports sequences well he doesnt let viewers down that department however predictable they turn out be its surprising me that supporting cast comprising varun sharma naveen polishetty tahir raj bhasin saharsh kumar shukla has done much better job here than lead duo sushant who is usually pretty good shraddha kapoor who is yet impress me acting wise its their nuances that are comparatively more memorable what it is chhichhore doesnt require its viewers overwork their brains essence its equivalent eating maggi noodles it gives you instant energy but not much beyond if you can deal with certain level cringe worthy clich s then chhichhore could very well up your alley looking at 8 rating i realize that our audiences still buy into anything that offers decent dose nostalgia even if its not most competently written made verdict throwaway watch,0.5466634272756723,0.1590217039196631,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.43}"
