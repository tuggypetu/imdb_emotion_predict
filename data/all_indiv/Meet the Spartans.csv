1.0,Terrible in every way possible.,"A dismal failure of a spoof with only the slightest bit of funny. This dreck breaks all the rules of good spoofing.1. Be timely. A joke about Ellen in Mr Wrong? Really? 2. Be funny when offensive. Accident prone kid in Scary Movie 3, mildly funny. Assault on a kid by Spartian, not funny.3. Be subtle sometimes. Not everything has to go to the extreme.4. Be broad. Go everywhere for your spoofs, not just the same wells over and over.AND MOST IMPORTANTLY....5. DON'T EXPLAIN EVERY RIFF AND SOURCE MATERIAL. If you have to tell your audience where it comes from, chances are it's not funny.The fact that this film is only 60 odd minutes plus one of the longest credit sequences loaded with even more unfunny deleted scenes (seriously can't those wait for the DVD no one should buy either), that's just adding insult to injury.",terrible every way possible,dismal failure spoof with only slightest bit funny this dreck breaks all rules good spoofing 1 be timely joke about ellen mr wrong really 2 be funny when offensive accident prone kid scary movie 3 mildly funny assault kid by spartian not funny 3 be subtle sometimes not everything has go extreme 4 be broad go everywhere your spoofs not just same wells over over most importantly 5 dont explain every riff source material if you have tell your audience where it comes chances are its not funny fact that this film is only 60 odd minutes plus one longest credit sequences loaded with even more unfunny deleted scenes seriously cant those wait dvd no one should buy either thats just adding insult injury,0.7327898550724639,-0.030978260869565212,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
1.0,I left the movie tired and depressed.,"The only reason I went to see this movie, was because I knew it was going to be bad. That's obviously not a good reason, but in retrospect, some really bad movies are funny when thought about later. I've had chuckles about how bad Epic Movie was, but this....this was different. Maybe it was the fact that half the audience was laughing at these awful jokes, or the fact that this stupid monstrosity was even green lighted, but after this ended I felt drained of my life. No movie has ever made me feel this way.""Meet the Spartans"" has the sparse running time of 65 minutes (not counting the lengthy end credits), which was a blessing to the audience. The jokes all feel like ones that 9 year old boys would find hysterical, where everyone else would just hate them. Other than spoof jokes, every other joke is one involving pain. There were dozens of crotch hits and back breaks. There are also many gross out, vomit, sneezing, and boil bursting jokes. There was one joke that had me mildly chuckling, but then they killed the joke by over explaining it. It didn't need to be explained, a monkey could understand it. Repetitiveness was the only word that comes to mind when watching this. King Leonidas knocks a messenger in the hole, then his two men. Okay, not funny, but at least it's over....right? Nope. Then he knocks Sanjaya, Brittany Spears, Kevin Federline, The American Idol judges and Ryan Seacrest in the hole. After the credits seem to be over, deleted scenes are shown simply to make the movie more than 70 minutes. During the deleted scenes, Dane Cook, George W. Bush, Tom Cruise, and Ellen Degeneres are also knocked in the hole. The joke is done 10 times over.The two extremely untalented writers of this mess want to include every movie possible, and mention every celebrity they can, and include any show they can cram in. There are 3 instances of celebrity panels judging the Spartans in this, and it's not like it was a running joke either. It was just lack of ideas. Much of the celebrity humor was just the celebrities pointing out their character traits. Paris Hilton, who is in a few scenes, but ultimately disappears with no point, talks about her jail time. Brittany Spears acts crazy. Lindsey Lohan gets out of rehab. Tyra Banks shows her cellulite. And every other celebrity that is made fun of, has the exact same role. Also, there is a joke in poor taste. When Leonidas is going to be killed by a talking penguin, it says, ""Say hi to Anna Nicole Smith for me."" These idiot writers are stooping as low as to make fun of people being dead? It's terrible. References to TV were thrown around, usually making no sense and totally pointless. Ugly Betty is the oracle. Just plain stupid. The movies were also thrown about all over so people in the audience could say, ""Duh, I know what they're referencing."" To give away a mild spoiler and one of the dumbest scenes in the movie, Carmen Electra's character turns into Spiderman and she beats up the Sandman, who is then pooped on by a cat. It made no sense why it was thrown in here. That's how I felt about pretty much every part of this movie though.Now, back to myself. When the movie ended after just over an hour, I had a headache, and wondered how dumb some people truly are, because nobody of any intelligence could've thought this was hilarious. But of course this is my opinion, and warning, don't see this movie! It will cause depression.My rating: Possibly worst movie I've ever seen. 80 mins. PG-13 for language, sexual and crude humor.",i left movie tired depressed,only reason i went see this movie was because i knew it was going be bad thats obviously not good reason but retrospect some really bad movies are funny when thought about later ive had chuckles about how bad epic movie was but this this was different maybe it was fact that half audience was laughing at these awful jokes or fact that this stupid monstrosity was even green lighted but after this ended i felt drained my life no movie has ever made me feel this way meet spartans has sparse running time 65 minutes not counting lengthy end credits which was blessing audience jokes all feel like ones that 9 year old boys would find hysterical where everyone else would just hate them other than spoof jokes every other joke is one involving pain there were dozens crotch hits back breaks there are also many gross out vomit sneezing boil bursting jokes there was one joke that had me mildly chuckling but then they killed joke by over explaining it it didnt need be explained monkey could understand it repetitiveness was only word that comes mind when watching this king leonidas knocks messenger hole then his two men okay not funny but at least its over right nope then he knocks sanjaya brittany spears kevin federline american idol judges ryan seacrest hole after credits seem be over deleted scenes are shown simply make movie more than 70 minutes during deleted scenes dane cook george w bush tom cruise ellen degeneres are also knocked hole joke is done 10 times over two extremely untalented writers this mess want include every movie possible mention every celebrity they can include any show they can cram there are 3 instances celebrity panels judging spartans this its not like it was running joke either it was just lack ideas much celebrity humor was just celebrities pointing out their character traits paris hilton who is few scenes but ultimately disappears with no point talks about her jail time brittany spears acts crazy lindsey lohan gets out rehab tyra banks shows her cellulite every other celebrity that is made fun has exact same role also there is joke poor taste when leonidas is going be killed by talking penguin it says say hi anna nicole smith me these idiot writers are stooping as low as make fun people being dead its terrible references tv were thrown around usually making no sense totally pointless ugly betty is oracle just plain stupid movies were also thrown about all over so people audience could say duh i know what theyre referencing give away mild spoiler one dumbest scenes movie carmen electras character turns into spiderman she beats up sandman who is then pooped by cat it made no sense why it was thrown here thats how i felt about pretty much every part this movie though now back myself when movie ended after just over hour i had headache wondered how dumb some people truly are because nobody any intelligence couldve thought this was hilarious but course this is my opinion warning dont see this movie it will cause depression my rating possibly worst movie ive ever seen 80 mins pg 13 language sexual crude humor,0.5141304347826087,-0.15874741200828155,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.27}"
6.0,I think I'm in the Minority Here,"Was this a bad movie? Compellingly bad. So bad that you have to see what comes next. There are more gay jokes in this flick than can be found in a double feature of ""The Bird Cage"" and ""The Torch Singer"". Were the Spartans homosexuals? Duh! Why did I like this movie? ""Meet the Spartans"" was a structure-free movie, possibly made without a script. Each joke must stand on its own and does. Throughout is the best imitation of Leonidas I can imagine, saying things that I never thought would leave the actor's mouth.This movies isn't Airplane, but it is funny. More than funny, it is fun.

1.0,The movie you'll watch when you dine in hell.,"This is perhaps one of the most awful films I've seen. Much as I enjoy tacky spoof humor, this movie just falls flat. So many of the film's jokes are so drawn out that whatever humor originally present just gets diluted. It was funny kicking a celebrity into the pit of death once. Five times later, it's just stale and dragging. If you've seen the trailers to this, you've basically seen about 90% of the film. The script could have been easily condensed to a 10 minute sketch for Saturday Night Live. The humor is so repetitive; almost all of the jokes play off either the Spartans questionable sexuality or celebrities' promiscuity. A blurred-out vagina just isn't that funny, why did the movie choose to use it 5 times? While there were numerous pop-culture references, there simply wasn't much done with it. Someone forgot to tell the middle-schooler who wrote this that having a poorly impersonated celebrity appear isn't funny by itself.Don't see this movie, even if you liked similar spoof movies (like Scary Movie).",movie youll watch when you dine hell,this is perhaps one most awful films ive seen much as i enjoy tacky spoof humor this movie just falls flat so many films jokes are so drawn out that whatever humor originally present just gets diluted it was funny kicking celebrity into pit death once five times later its just stale dragging if youve seen trailers this youve basically seen about 90 film script could have been easily condensed 10 minute sketch saturday night live humor is so repetitive almost all jokes play off either spartans questionable sexuality or celebrities promiscuity blurred out vagina just isnt that funny why did movie choose use it 5 times while there were numerous pop culture references there simply wasnt much done with it someone forgot tell middle schooler who wrote this that having poorly impersonated celebrity appear isnt funny by itself dont see this movie even if you liked similar spoof movies like scary movie,0.5186190476190476,0.005787878787878786,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer are hacks,"Anyone who would remotely consider themselves to be a fan of the spoof genre would reject this trash. I'll be the first one to admit that taste is subjective, but the guys that made this movie lack any sort of talent for this type of movieI implore anyone to check out the following spoof movies: Airplane! Top Secret The Naked Gun The Naked Gun 2 1/2 Hot Shots Hot Shots: Part Deux Kentucky Fried Movie (yes, its ""old"" but a classic none the less) Mafia! BASEketball Scary Movie 3 Sacry Movie 4 Not all of these are great. Many are a product of their era. Some are downright ""average"" spoof movies, at best. But compared to ""Meet the Spartans"" (or Epic Movie or Date Movie) they are a BILLION times better. And they have one thing in common... Zucker / Abrahams / Zucker (also must give props to writer Pat Proft). These guys INVENTED this genre.

10.0,The reason cinema was invented,"Having previously seen ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"" (also by these gentlemen) and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (by the equally talented Edward Woodward) I was gasping and sweating and feeling my anus slacken with anticipation when I heard this movie was going to be released. I was even more delighted when I saw the trailer. All too often comedy movie trailers contain all the best jokes, leaving nothing funny for the actual movie. I knew this movie was going to be great when I saw the trailer and there wasn't ONE FUNNY BIT IN IT!!!!! Clearly these were film makers who did not need to advertise their greatness, as they could rely on their genius to advertise itself. I knew we were going to experience a comedy masterpiece on par with ""Diff'rent Strokes"", ""Australia's Funniest Home Videos"" or Michael Jackson's cosmetic surgery.I set up camp outside the box office 2 days before tickets went on sale to be sure we got the first tickets accompanied, after a sound thrashing, by my wife and my little boy. For two days and nights we struggled on that lonely sidewalk against hunger and thirst and heat and exposure, and towards the end we had to resort to drinking our own urine. But it was worth it, because when ""Meet the Spartans"" finally opened we were the only people in the cinema.And what a movie it was! My own memories are a little hazy given the addled state I was in after two days in the street. For my own part, I was laughing and hollering too much at the little purple animals floating around in the cinema to notice much of the movie. I do remember bits of the trailer getting repeated over and over again, but that must have been the hallucinations as well. However I do remember my wife and my little boy found it so funny they were too astonished to laugh. After a while the exertions of the previous 2 days took their toll and they fell asleep with their precious heads lolling into my unwashed groin. But shoot, I wasn't complaining :-) All in all it was probably the greatest day of my life, and perhaps anyone's life.I was delighted to learn that there was a ""Meet the Spartans 2"". If there was one film crying out for a sequel, it must surely be this one. As with ""Weekend at Bernie's"", you just got the feeling that one movie was not enough to fully explore the vast richness of ideas on display. One can only hope it will produce more sequels than the Star Wars and the Police Academy series combined.",reason cinema was invented,having previously seen date movie epic movie also by these gentlemen plan 9 outer space by equally talented edward woodward i was gasping sweating feeling my anus slacken with anticipation when i heard this movie was going be released i was even more delighted when i saw trailer all too often comedy movie trailers contain all best jokes leaving nothing funny actual movie i knew this movie was going be great when i saw trailer there wasnt one funny bit it clearly these were film makers who did not need advertise their greatness as they could rely their genius advertise itself i knew we were going experience comedy masterpiece par with diffrent strokes australias funniest home videos or michael jacksons cosmetic surgery i set up camp outside box office 2 days before tickets went sale be sure we got first tickets accompanied after sound thrashing by my wife my little boy two days nights we struggled that lonely sidewalk against hunger thirst heat exposure towards end we had resort drinking our own urine but it was worth it because when meet spartans finally opened we were only people cinema what movie it was my own memories are little hazy given addled state i was after two days street my own part i was laughing hollering too much at little purple animals floating around cinema notice much movie i do remember bits trailer getting repeated over over again but that must have been hallucinations as well however i do remember my wife my little boy found it so funny they were too astonished laugh after while exertions previous 2 days took their toll they fell asleep with their precious heads lolling into my unwashed groin but shoot i wasnt complaining all all it was probably greatest day my life perhaps anyones life i was delighted learn that there was meet spartans 2 if there was one film crying out sequel it must surely be this one as with weekend at bernies you just got feeling that one movie was not enough fully explore vast richness ideas display one can only hope it will produce more sequels than star wars police academy series combined,0.6290277777777777,0.24374999999999997,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.38}"
1.0,An All Time Low for Comedy,"I work at a movie theater, so the only reason I went to see this movie was because it was free and I thought that it just might be the kind of movie that's so bad me and my friends could entertain ourselves by making fun of it. However, Meet the Spartans left us completely dumbfounded and speechless. It's beyond bad! There was nothing you could say that could make of this movie, it does it all by itself and it doesn't even allow you to laugh while you watch it going down in flames. I considered its predecessor, Epic Movie, to be among one of the worst movies ever made. I didn't think it could possibly get worse, but it did. It's like watching 300 all over again expect with ridiculous pop culture references that aren't even funny. The guys who made this movie obviously don't understand comedy in the slightest bit. I hope that this is the last one of these ridiculous comedies that gets to occupy a theater over another film that might actually be worth something. This film is a waste of money for starters, but even if you don't have to pay, it's just a waste of time.",all time low comedy,i work at movie theater so only reason i went see this movie was because it was free i thought that it just might be kind movie thats so bad me my friends could entertain ourselves by making fun it however meet spartans left us completely dumbfounded speechless its beyond bad there was nothing you could say that could make this movie it does it all by itself it doesnt even allow you laugh while you watch it going down flames i considered its predecessor epic movie be among one worst movies ever made i didnt think it could possibly get worse but it did its like watching 300 all over again expect with ridiculous pop culture references that arent even funny guys who made this movie obviously dont understand comedy slightest bit i hope that this is last one these ridiculous comedies that gets occupy theater over another film that might actually be worth something this film is waste money starters but even if you dont have pay its just waste time,0.521256038647343,-0.07270531400966182,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.19}"
4.0,"Sloppy, but fun","I was looking forward to seeing Meet the Spartans, from the first few theatrical trailers, it looked like a lot of fun and not like a horrible parody. But I have to admit that when it had it's TV spots, it was starting to look bad, but my boyfriend and I still saw it last night, just to see maybe if it still had some laughs. Now, while I'm still disappointed in most of the movie, there were a few good laughs I think. It was made pretty badly, but I think most spoof movies are made that way since they don't have a sense of reality, so I'll be kind on that subject. Plus, the movie in general was weird, they took on the movie 300, fully, like re-shot the entire film, and just added their own jokes on TV, movies, pop culture, and random things.Leonidas has just been made king of Sparta, and his world is rocking with his bombshell wife, Queen Margo, and life couldn't be better. But when he is challenged by the Persians, he must protect Sparta with, well, only 8 guys. But hoping that ""they will survive"", they go into a battle of stomping the yard, talking smack, and even having to deal with some transformers. Leonidas is getting more and more steamed though as he realizes that the blue screen Persians may be too much for he and his team can handle.Meet the Spartans had some really funny moments, like I loved and nearly died laughing when the Spartans were leaving their country and they left hand in hand singing ""I will Survive"", it was so stupid, I know, but if you let go and have fun, I'm sure you'll laugh too. But there were things I was disappointed in, like the constant potty humor, it would be nice if the writers grew past the second grade level humor. There was some jokes that were predictable and used too many times in other spoofs. But over all this was definitely better than Epic Movie or Date Movie. If you go to see this, there are a few laughs, but don't expect the best comedy of the year.4/10",sloppy but fun,i was looking forward seeing meet spartans first few theatrical trailers it looked like lot fun not like horrible parody but i have admit that when it had its tv spots it was starting look bad but my boyfriend i still saw it last night just see maybe if it still had some laughs now while im still disappointed most movie there were few good laughs i think it was made pretty badly but i think most spoof movies are made that way since they dont have sense reality so ill be kind that subject plus movie general was weird they took movie 300 fully like re shot entire film just added their own jokes tv movies pop culture random things leonidas has just been made king sparta his world is rocking with his bombshell wife queen margo life couldnt be better but when he is challenged by persians he must protect sparta with well only 8 guys but hoping that they will survive they go into battle stomping yard talking smack even having deal with some transformers leonidas is getting more more steamed though as he realizes that blue screen persians may be too much he his team can handle meet spartans had some really funny moments like i loved nearly died laughing when spartans were leaving their country they left hand hand singing i will survive it was so stupid i know but if you let go have fun im sure youll laugh too but there were things i was disappointed like constant potty humor it would be nice if writers grew past second grade level humor there was some jokes that were predictable used too many times other spoofs but over all this was definitely better than epic movie or date movie if you go see this there are few laughs but dont expect best comedy year 4 10,0.495940170940171,0.048878205128205135,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.21}"

It is a comedy and it gives what it promises. I read some of the comments and people are really harsh on it. Come on, it is not a masterpiece for sure but it is not that bad. I am pretty sure a lot of people voted without watching and they voted very low since this is making fun of 300.

There was the odd part where I might have cracked a smile or thought, ""This might be funny if..."" but there is a very good reason for that. Instead of making good jokes and thoughtful humour, the writers decided to just constantly send an endless stream of jokes at you and hoped one of them made you chuckle.

1.0,Yaaaaawwwwwn.....are we there yet?,"If ever a movie represented the tired, clapped out end of a genre's current run this is it. Boys and Girls, the spoof is officially dead and Meet the Spartans it's long, drawn out last breath. It's OK though, don't be upset, like every genre it will resurrect itself in time, with a glossy new appearance and a brand new generation of audience. But before we bury the corpse, let's just take one last look at the body to try to examine the cause of death and who the perpetrators of this heinous crime were.Hmmm, yes....if you look closely, there are definite signs of strangulation in the script. Every single gross-out event of the last 12 months was squeezed and throttled into a tight 60 minutes. The ""jokes"" were delivered like bullets from a Gatling gun and every one missed their target, because we could all see them coming from 50 miles away.But the real cause of death was old age and neglect. Everyone associated with this movie is equally guilty of flogging this old horse to death and they knew it. The movie started out reasonably creatively, with a spoof of Casino Royale, but then it gave up and just played out the 300 storyline. The scriptwriters knew it was all over and just gave up. The running time of 60 minutes is proof of their guilt.Almost to their credit the actors (if indeed that's what they were) seemed embarrassed by their role in this crime, but to their shame, they will not be able to avoid charges of aiding and abetting.The budget for this movie must have been around $30 plus change. All shot in one studio stage, ""actors"" playing dual roles, no location shots, pitiful CGI, stupendously awful make up, props and sets, seemingly borrowed from Plan 9 from Outer Space.When they viewed the rushes, the Producers could see that their fingerprints were all over the body and decided not to show it to the critics, but rather release it directly to the paying public under a veil of hype, which they hoped would be their alibi. But, if you look at the comments in this forum, we were not fooled and they are guilty as charged.Take 'em down!",yaaaaawwwwwn are we there yet,if ever movie represented tired clapped out end genres current run this is it boys girls spoof is officially dead meet spartans its long drawn out last breath its ok though dont be upset like every genre it will resurrect itself time with glossy new appearance brand new generation audience but before we bury corpse lets just take one last look at body try examine cause death who perpetrators this heinous crime were hmmm yes if you look closely there are definite signs strangulation script every single gross out event last 12 months was squeezed throttled into tight 60 minutes jokes were delivered like bullets gatling gun every one missed their target because we could all see them coming 50 miles away but real cause death was old age neglect everyone associated with this movie is equally guilty flogging this old horse death they knew it movie started out reasonably creatively with spoof casino royale but then it gave up just played out 300 storyline scriptwriters knew it was all over just gave up running time 60 minutes is proof their guilt almost their credit actors if indeed thats what they were seemed embarrassed by their role this crime but their shame they will not be able avoid charges aiding abetting budget this movie must have been around 30 plus change all shot one studio stage actors playing dual roles no location shots pitiful cgi stupendously awful make up props sets seemingly borrowed plan 9 outer space when they viewed rushes producers could see that their fingerprints were all over body decided not show it critics but rather release it directly paying public under veil hype which they hoped would be their alibi but if you look at comments this forum we were not fooled they are guilty as charged take em down,0.4070239431350543,-0.03640104751215862,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.08, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.46}"
1.0,It's impossible to write a review of this movie!,"I mean, it's impossible to review this movie without making the review sound just as bad as the movie itself. But why am I stating the obvious? Of course it's bad. Anyone whose aware of the collective works of the notoriously untalented Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer know this is bad. Anyone who doesn't know need not apply. I can't believe I'm saying this but there are more substantial train wrecks than this horrible, disgusting, unfunny, idiotic, pathetic, shameless, inconsistent, insulting, asinine, foolish, oafish, and insignificant (I need to look up more words in the dictionary to describe this movie) waste of time and money (but since I mercifully saw it on TV, at least I'm not guilty at wasting any cash).It's probably much more fun to write a review about this piece of crap by imagining how Friedberg and Seltzer came up with this incredible idea.Friedberg: ""Hey! I just saw 300 man! It was awesome! But you know what's more awesome? Why don't we make a comedy about it? I mean come on! These guys are wearing like, what are those, skirts? Are they gay or something? Why don't we make a movie where these Spartan dudes are gay! People will dig that right? I mean they dig anything 300 these days!"" Seltzer: ""Yeah man, that will be, like, awesome too! I mean I was thinking of like doing a spoof on pop culture icons like the guys in American Idol or Ryan Seacrest or Britney or Paris Hilton or even those guys in Stomp the Yard and Step Up. And then maybe we can riff on TV commercials as well. But I guess we'll go with your idea. After all, my ideas suck! I didn't even like it!"" Friedberg: ""Are you f#&@ing kidding? That's brilliant! Tell you what, we'll combine our ideas together to make a masterpiece. Yeah! This will be big! I'm having an epiphany right know! Wait a minute... Epipihany, what does that mean anyway? Never mind, so here it is: We set this in the same time as 300. That was like, before the first World War, right? So these 300 dudes are like gay right? So we'll just remake the whole story of 300 only make it funny. Yeah, and we'll put in those pop culture references of yours and that will just be a gas! I mean, that Leonidas guy pushes Britney, the judges of Idol, Ryan Seacrest down the Pit of Doom! And then there would be, like, a hip-hop showdown between Spartans and Persians. Yeah, people will laugh so wild that this might just be a classic like AIRPLANE! Yeah, this is gonna be big!"" Seltzer: ""Nice one man! I mean your like f#&@ing Spielberg man! Only Spielberg never thought of having that guy from Borat playing Xerxes or have Rocky, Ghost Rider, that dancing penguin from Happy Feet, and Carmen Electra in one movie! By the way, Spielberg did this movie with this guy Bay about Transformers. I was thinking, why not put in a giant robot? People will laugh like crazy, man! I mean, we don't have the budget, but hey, we made that classic EPIC MOVIE without having to spend lots of cash. And while were at it, there's got to be like product placements here so people will know we threw in everything on this movie. Nothing is safe from our riffing. Man I love working with you! Friedberg: ""Yeah man! Me too man! I mean, we're like that guy Hitchcock and that guy Jim Stewart. Or that guy Spielberg and Lucas. We make one hell of a team. I mean, who needs the critics? I don't even read their reviews! I don't even read! Now, let's make this baby a reality!"" Setlzer: ""Way ahead of you man! Nicole Parker's already on board and some guy Sean Maguire too. Wait, 'some guy Sean Macguire'? Hey that rhymes! So anyway, lets do this! People are, like, waiting for our next movie! This is like freakin' STAR WARS EPISODE I all over again! Maybe this time, we'll have guys camping in front of the theaters just to be first in line to get tickets! Man, I love Hollywood!"" Friedberg: ""Oh by the way man, one last thing. What if the movie sucked?"" Rating: 0 out of 5.",its impossible write review this movie,i mean its impossible review this movie without making review sound just as bad as movie itself but why am i stating obvious course its bad anyone whose aware collective works notoriously untalented jason friedberg aaron seltzer know this is bad anyone who doesnt know need not apply i cant believe im saying this but there are more substantial train wrecks than this horrible disgusting unfunny idiotic pathetic shameless inconsistent insulting asinine foolish oafish insignificant i need look up more words dictionary describe this movie waste time money but since i mercifully saw it tv at least im not guilty at wasting any cash its probably much more fun write review about this piece crap by imagining how friedberg seltzer came up with this incredible idea friedberg hey i just saw 300 man it was awesome but you know whats more awesome why dont we make comedy about it i mean come these guys are wearing like what are those skirts are they gay or something why dont we make movie where these spartan dudes are gay people will dig that right i mean they dig anything 300 these days seltzer yeah man that will be like awesome too i mean i was thinking like doing spoof pop culture icons like guys american idol or ryan seacrest or britney or paris hilton or even those guys stomp yard step up then maybe we can riff tv commercials as well but i guess well go with your idea after all my ideas suck i didnt even like it friedberg are you f kidding thats brilliant tell you what well combine our ideas together make masterpiece yeah this will be big im having epiphany right know wait minute epipihany what does that mean anyway never mind so here it is we set this same time as 300 that was like before first world war right so these 300 dudes are like gay right so well just remake whole story 300 only make it funny yeah well put those pop culture references yours that will just be gas i mean that leonidas guy pushes britney judges idol ryan seacrest down pit doom then there would be like hip hop showdown between spartans persians yeah people will laugh so wild that this might just be classic like airplane yeah this is gonna be big seltzer nice one man i mean your like f spielberg man only spielberg never thought having that guy borat playing xerxes or have rocky ghost rider that dancing penguin happy feet carmen electra one movie by way spielberg did this movie with this guy bay about transformers i was thinking why not put giant robot people will laugh like crazy man i mean we dont have budget but hey we made that classic epic movie without having spend lots cash while were at it theres got be like product placements here so people will know we threw everything this movie nothing is safe our riffing man i love working with you friedberg yeah man me too man i mean were like that guy hitchcock that guy jim stewart or that guy spielberg lucas we make one hell team i mean who needs critics i dont even read their reviews i dont even read now lets make this baby reality setlzer way ahead you man nicole parkers already board some guy sean maguire too wait some guy sean macguire hey that rhymes so anyway lets do this people are like waiting our next movie this is like freakin star wars episode i all over again maybe this time well have guys camping front theaters just be first line get tickets man i love hollywood friedberg oh by way man one last thing what if movie sucked rating 0 out 5,0.5905879722781131,0.028107534093449592,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.23}"

When Leonidas and Captain set out for Thermopylae, they only have 13 soldiers instead of 300.

1.0,Meet The Garbage can,"You hear that? That's the sound of spoof movies scrapping the bottom of the barrel. Scary Movie 2 was a sign that there would be dark days ahead for the spoof genre. Although Meet The Spartans is not as bad as Epic Movie and Date Movie, its still an awful feature.Plot: Don't even kid yourself. NONE! Opinion: This is the most painful spoof you'll ever have to sit through in 2008. Every joke is either centered around homosexuality or some gross out gag. This movie mainly spoofs 300 but it takes time to skewer Shrek, Stomp The Yard Spiderman 3 and Happy Feet(why, please tell me why?). You might like this slop if you find the following funny: 1. A penguin pooping in Leonidas's mouth. 2.A bunch of sweaty men dancing to Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive. 3.Ill-timed gay gags. 4.Everybody getting kicked into the pit of death. 5.Jokes being explained repeatedly. 6.Jokes being spotted a mile away(like the Stomp The Yard scene) Etc. The jokes are predictable and every one of them fall to the ground with a resounding thud like Johny Fairplay(what, too late?). You get the point. Life is too short to waste on another bad spoof. Stick with Airplane, Top Secret, Hot Shots, Naked Gun, Don't Be A Menace, Im Gonna Git U Sucka, Scary Movie(the first one) and every other spoof from the past.
