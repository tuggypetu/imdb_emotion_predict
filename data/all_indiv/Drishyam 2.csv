10,"So here is ""The Dark Knight"" in Indian Cinema of Sequels.","Not all sequels are bad but also, not majority of them are able to create the same impact as that of its first installment. But rarely in a lifetime, a sequel surpasses it's original / first part. Now anything that comes close to it is Drishyam 2 in terms of level of satisfaction that an audience should get after a cinema watching experience.Pulling a story out of thin air and creating such a masterpiece drama is not possible unless there is good content, crisp writing and terrific performances. There may be flaws but hardly derails the narrative. Overall a brilliant cinema from South again and perfect example for the concept of Sequels.Lastly, Georgekutty again is the real BIG BULL in this Drishyam series.",so here is dark knight indian cinema sequels,not all sequels are bad but also not majority them are able create same impact as that its first installment but rarely lifetime sequel surpasses its original first part now anything that comes close it is drishyam 2 terms level satisfaction that audience should get after cinema watching experience pulling story out thin air creating such masterpiece drama is not possible unless there is good content crisp writing terrific performances there may be flaws but hardly derails narrative overall brilliant cinema south again perfect example concept sequels lastly georgekutty again is real big bull this drishyam series,0.5629166666666666,0.14916666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.16}"
10,One of the few times the sequel lives up to its predecessor,"Before releasing the review please note that there is a part of this review that reveals one of the scenes because it was crucial to explain a flaw...Drishyam 2 was a well written and well directed movie filled with superb performances. First half is definitely is slow and subtle but after the 1hr 10min mark the thrill starts taking place and then you'll have goosebumps till the movie is done. This was probably Lalettan's best performance in recent times and his family, Meena, Esther, Ansiba and the side cast including Murali Gopy was solid and did not make me feel uncomfortable for 1 second throughout the entire movie. Although there were some improbable elements like waiting for the remains to be uncovered and then replacing it without any visible struggle but the movie made up for those things with everything else.",one few times sequel lives up its predecessor,before releasing review please note that there is part this review that reveals one scenes because it was crucial explain flaw drishyam 2 was well written well directed movie filled with superb performances first half is definitely is slow subtle but after 1hr 10min mark thrill starts taking place then youll have goosebumps till movie is done this was probably lalettans best performance recent times his family meena esther ansiba side cast including murali gopy was solid did not make me feel uncomfortable 1 second throughout entire movie although there were some improbable elements like waiting remains be uncovered then replacing it without any visible struggle but movie made up those things with everything else,0.47678571428571426,0.08214285714285714,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.43, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.35}"

8,Malayalam Cinema deserves Loudest Applause for fetching an Impossible and Never Seen Before Classic Sequel to a Masterpiece thriller.,"Drishyam 2 (2021) : Movie Review -Sequel is a word which comes with heavy burden of matching the predecessor and that's why most of the times only safe films like to go that way. But when it comes to Thriller genre, making a sequel is almost an impossible job considering the suspense had been revealed already in the climax of the first time and most importantly it had provided a fulfil end. Drishyam (2013) came out as an Outstanding thriller in Indian Cinema with great touch of realism within Cinematic boundaries from where making a sequel when we have already know that unknown truth was not just tough but naturally an untouched thing. With Drishyam 2, Malayalam Cinema celebreates a triumph of a battle which was never ever fought by anyone in Indian Cinema and to some extent in World Cinema. The realistic sense slightly disappears this time but the cinematic liberty and pressure of carrying the legacy of Masterpiece Drishyam gives it a chance to stand as a Classic Sequel on its own.Drishyam 2 begins after 6 years where we left Drishyam but the never ending investigation strikes again to shake the family again. How Police finds out those unknown evidence and how Georgekutty plans a new script to save his family is all you get to see in the film. One of the biggest plus point of the storyline is a reference of Cinema withing a cinema or should I say Script within a Script because the ultimate goal of this narrative was nothing but to make visuals look deceptive. There are few slight errors in the writing though, one can still forgive it in the name of Cinematic Liberty. Couple of things look far away from regular police investigation where they have to use the characters being predictably deceptive and the ""Luck"" factor, which is still plausible in movie making sense.Coming to the acting department, Drishyam 2 is Mohanlal show all the way. Unlike its predecessor, Drishyam focuses more on George Kutty than his family. So obviously rest of cast playing the role of family members don't get enough chance to showcase their skills. On the other side we have solid character of new Investigating officer Mr. Thomas played terrifically by Murali Gopy. The supporting is fine with their minimal appearances.Drishyam 2 has faltered in the editing where first half of the film is a complete waste. You could even start watching the film post Interval and still there won't any issues. The Idea of stretching it for 153 minutes is nothing but a big blunder. If the second half had not been classy enough then who knows it might have ended up as an average film by the blessings of malice of First Half. Dialogues sound pretty good, nothing extraordinary though, except for the internal salvation part in the climax. Cinematography is decent and background is fine too.Director Jeethu Joseph deserves a special mention for his guts that he even thought of making this impossible sequel and unexpectedly gave full justice to it. This idea of making a sequel to Drishyam was so amazing but the fact that it can never be matched was also there to discourage him and Luckily he didn't fumbled too much. Overall, Drishyam 2 is not upto the unachievable mark of its Predecessor but as we all know that even going close to it a Big Achievement in itself and that's what it is. Yes, recommended.RATING - 8/10*",malayalam cinema deserves loudest applause fetching impossible never seen before classic sequel masterpiece thriller,drishyam 2 2021 movie review sequel is word which comes with heavy burden matching predecessor thats why most times only safe films like go that way but when it comes thriller genre making sequel is almost impossible job considering suspense had been revealed already climax first time most importantly it had provided fulfil end drishyam 2013 came out as outstanding thriller indian cinema with great touch realism within cinematic boundaries where making sequel when we have already know that unknown truth was not just tough but naturally untouched thing with drishyam 2 malayalam cinema celebreates triumph battle which was never ever fought by anyone indian cinema some extent world cinema realistic sense slightly disappears this time but cinematic liberty pressure carrying legacy masterpiece drishyam gives it chance stand as classic sequel its own drishyam 2 begins after 6 years where we left drishyam but never ending investigation strikes again shake family again how police finds out those unknown evidence how georgekutty plans new script save his family is all you get see film one biggest plus point storyline is reference cinema withing cinema or should i say script within script because ultimate goal this narrative was nothing but make visuals look deceptive there are few slight errors writing though one can still forgive it name cinematic liberty couple things look far away regular police investigation where they have use characters being predictably deceptive luck factor which is still plausible movie making sense coming acting department drishyam 2 is mohanlal show all way unlike its predecessor drishyam focuses more george kutty than his family so obviously rest cast playing role family members dont get enough chance showcase their skills other side we have solid character new investigating officer mr thomas played terrifically by murali gopy supporting is fine with their minimal appearances drishyam 2 has faltered editing where first half film is complete waste you could even start watching film post interval still there wont any issues idea stretching it 153 minutes is nothing but big blunder if second half had not been classy enough then who knows it might have ended up as average film by blessings malice first half dialogues sound pretty good nothing extraordinary though except internal salvation part climax cinematography is decent background is fine too director jeethu joseph deserves special mention his guts that he even thought making this impossible sequel unexpectedly gave full justice it this idea making sequel drishyam was so amazing but fact that it can never be matched was also there discourage him luckily he didnt fumbled too much overall drishyam 2 is not upto unachievable mark its predecessor but as we all know that even going close it big achievement itself thats what it is yes recommended rating 8 10,0.47812718682283906,0.09854079093209525,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"

10,Does he deserve to get lucky a second time?,"Drishyam (2013) is probably one of the top 5 well made thrillers I have watched, all around and across all languages. To be very honest, I did not have very high expectations from the sequel. To me, surpassing Drishyam's brilliance was impossible, even if it came from the same talented team. Yes, I knew the movie would be good but never did I imagine it will top its predecessor and would it do it so gloriously.In a nutshell, the story picks up 6 years after the first movie. And it transports the viewers meticulously back into Georgekutty's world. It effectively manages to give the viewer a very good idea of what has happened so far in George's life. How people's perception towards him and his family has changed over the years. The first half lays the groundwork. It introduces a few new characters. The story moves at a very good pace, narrating George's family life, some sub plots. The incidents of prequel always looming in the background. A twist around the end of 1st half takes you by surprise and sets up a premise for thrilling 2nd half. And a brilliant climax. Oh boy and it does it in style. The 2nd half is just brilliant. There's not a single dull moment. It won't let you take your eyes off the screen even for a second.Mohanlal gives a towering performance. He is terrific. He lives the character. Meena plays her part really well. Ansiba and Esther are good too. Asha Sharat leaves a mark.Jeetu Joseph does an outstanding job with his writing and direction. He's done a brilliant job. Writing and executing a sequel, to a film that was perfect in every aspect is not easy. And to make it better than the first one is a mark of a genius. Take a bow!The cinematography is good. A special mention for the background score which is just amazing.Cons? Well not really. There were a few cinematic liberties taken but hey doesn't the hero deserve to be lucky and have god watch over him sometimes? I won't complain about that. I wanted George Kutty to win.Verdict - Grab your pop corn, soda and make it a perfect movie night. Such thrillers are not made very often. Enjoy the experience. Just a word of caution, take all breaks before the 2nd half. The movie won't let you get up.",does he deserve get lucky second time,drishyam 2013 is probably one top 5 well made thrillers i have watched all around across all languages be very honest i did not have very high expectations sequel me surpassing drishyams brilliance was impossible even if it came same talented team yes i knew movie would be good but never did i imagine it will top its predecessor would it do it so gloriously nutshell story picks up 6 years after first movie it transports viewers meticulously back into georgekuttys world it effectively manages give viewer very good idea what has happened so far georges life how peoples perception towards him his family has changed over years first half lays groundwork it introduces few new characters story moves at very good pace narrating georges family life some sub plots incidents prequel always looming background twist around end 1st half takes you by surprise sets up premise thrilling 2nd half brilliant climax oh boy it does it style 2nd half is just brilliant theres not single dull moment it wont let you take your eyes off screen even second mohanlal gives towering performance he is terrific he lives character meena plays her part really well ansiba esther are good too asha sharat leaves mark jeetu joseph does outstanding job with his writing direction hes done brilliant job writing executing sequel film that was perfect every aspect is not easy make it better than first one is mark genius take bow cinematography is good special mention background score which is just amazing cons well not really there were few cinematic liberties taken but hey doesnt hero deserve be lucky have god watch over him sometimes i wont complain about that i wanted george kutty win verdict grab your pop corn soda make it perfect movie night such thrillers are not made very often enjoy experience just word caution take all breaks before 2nd half movie wont let you get up,0.5136220939554272,0.27584359467692804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.27}"
