10,A real heroism and an outrageous performances by every one!!!,"""Straight of the sheath, Kaththi is sharp most of the time, but not always. AR Murgadoss has come out with a film which has a neat social message, packaged well with mass entertainment elements. Vijay carries the film in a tricky dual role, which brings out the star in him whether doing comedy, romance, songs, fights and emotional scenes"".The film's story revolves around Vijay's dual characters – Jeevanandham and Kathiresan. Jeevanandham is a social activist who fights against a large corporate, which is planning to usurp the fertile lands of the farmers. On the other hand, Kathiresan is a thief who has escaped jail and is on the run. How Kathiresan steps into Jeevanandham's shoes and leads the fight against the corporate forms the crux of the story.""Vijay as Jeevanandham & Kathiresan has delivered a lifetime performance, and showed a brilliant variety in both the roles, albeit not even a great makeover between both the roles,""""Technically, Kaththi is a storm. The film possesses stunning visuals thanks to George C. Williams. Editing by Sreekar Passed is neat, yet a few trims in the first half would have stepped on the pedal. The art direction is surreal, and the stunts do bring up the ante, especially the coin flip fight sequence.Don't miss this one!!!",real heroism outrageous performances by every one,straight sheath kaththi is sharp most time but not always ar murgadoss has come out with film which has neat social message packaged well with mass entertainment elements vijay carries film tricky dual role which brings out star him whether doing comedy romance songs fights emotional scenes films story revolves around vijays dual characters jeevanandham kathiresan jeevanandham is social activist who fights against large corporate which is planning usurp fertile lands farmers other hand kathiresan is thief who has escaped jail is run how kathiresan steps into jeevanandhams shoes leads fight against corporate forms crux story vijay as jeevanandham kathiresan has delivered lifetime performance showed brilliant variety both roles albeit not even great makeover between both roles technically kaththi is storm film possesses stunning visuals thanks george c williams editing by sreekar passed is neat yet few trims first half would have stepped pedal art direction is surreal stunts do bring up ante especially coin flip fight sequence dont miss this one,0.4429089026915114,0.10279503105590063,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.31}"

10,Kaththi sharper than Thuppakki,"One of the best script and dialog's in recent Tamil movies. Vijay performed very well. Hats off to ARM sir and BGM is mass.Samantha is cute as usual.Neil Nitin Mukesh was perfect for his role.The message which was spoken in the movie is well conveyed and it will reach every corner of India. The dialog in the climax is class, Vijay delivered it in a very good manner. Dialogues in many scenes were too good.Only negative thing i feel that is the song placement.You can't compare Thuppakki with Kaththi, Thuppakki is an action thriller movie and Kaththi is an emotional social message movie.

7,Vijay is back with a Bang,"The film conveys a strong social message which depicts the current pity situation of farmers, where their resources are exploited by multinational companies.Regarding the first half, the screenplay is much slow and dramatic which makes you unfocused off the movie. But the film takes on in the second half with racy screenplay.Vijay's performance looked neat where he had emoted good in few scenes and avoided unnecessary punch dialogs. Actress Samantha is adequate in the movie. She is just used for filling the glamor quotient. Cinematography by George is appreciable.What worked out in the film is, A.R. Murugadoss' bold attempt in depicting country's corruption as well as MNC's con moves by razor sharp dialogs.Finally, actor Vijay has succeeded once again by joining with A.R. Murugadoss after 'Thupaaki'. After the failures of his previous flicks, Vijay had managed to rectify his mistakes and A.R. Murugadoss had well used the actor in the film.",vijay is back with bang,film conveys strong social message which depicts current pity situation farmers where their resources are exploited by multinational companies regarding first half screenplay is much slow dramatic which makes you unfocused off movie but film takes second half with racy screenplay vijays performance looked neat where he had emoted good few scenes avoided unnecessary punch dialogs actress samantha is adequate movie she is just used filling glamor quotient cinematography by george is appreciable what worked out film is r murugadoss bold attempt depicting countrys corruption as well as mncs con moves by razor sharp dialogs finally actor vijay has succeeded once again by joining with r murugadoss after thupaaki after failures his previous flicks vijay had managed rectify his mistakes r murugadoss had well used actor film,0.41916666666666663,-0.01875,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.39}"
10,Class Movie With Sharp Social Message,"Vijay and A.R.Murugadoss are back with their second outing together, Kaththi. The film features Vijay in two contrasting but physically 'identical' dual roles, Kathiresan and Jeevanantham. While Kathir is a crook who is on the run and one with 24 previous visits to the jail, Jeevanantham is a sober, educated activist who strives for the betterment of his impoverished village where water is a big concern. Their paths cross very early in the movie and the film is set in motion.Vijay has used this opportunity to play diverse roles in the same movie and proves his experience as a performer and as an entertainer. While Kathir is high on theatrics and is the Vijay that we have enjoyed on screen in many mass entertainers, Jeeva is fresh and non-Vijay in every aspect. Kathir is bound to be a fan favorite while the audiences are likely to empathize with Jeeva and his motives. In that aspect, Kaththi is a strong movie for the actor Vijay.Coming to director A.R.Murugadoss, he has touched upon many issues close to his heart such as rampant corruption, farmer suicides, the plight of senior citizens, water scarcity, the workings of the sensational news-hungry media and also goes on to vilify the corporates and their aggressive expansion plans without considering their CSR (corporate social responsibility) initiatives. The one scene late in the second half, when Vijay delivers an intense monologue on the above mentioned issues, is a definite highlight in the overall scheme of things. But it does try to get a little manipulative as the director has played to the gallery to win the audience's sympathy towards farmers and make us root for his protagonist.One feels Murugadoss could have gone a step forward and tightened the screenplay. The placement of all the songs leaves a lot to be desired, specially the much talked about 'Selfie Pulla'. 'Aathi' is delightfully shot whereas 'Pakkam Vandu', though a different exercise doesn't make an impact. But the dancer Vijay sparkles effortlessly in all these songs. Kaththi doesn't engage consistently as some sizzling moments are interspersed with moments of restlessness. The length of the movie is another drawback. The Thuppakki hangover continues in Kaththi to an extent. If Thuppakki was an ode to the Army, Kaththi is dedicated to the farmers of the land.Anirudh as usual adds lot of strength through his BGM score. If you hear the theatre roar for some of the strong scenes, the major part of the credit should go to him. The other youngster on board, DoP George C Williams makes a smooth transition to the big commercial space with some solid work on the visuals, the lighting patterns and the angles.Among the other performers, Neil Nitin Mukesh is a new addition to the list of suave, stylish villains. His voice and the dubbing elevate his overall performance. Samantha is sadly what you may call the 'typical commercial cinema heroine' who appears in the songs, few romantic scenes and stands in the background while the hero takes charge. All the actors who play the pivotal senior citizens are convincing. Sathish as Vijay's buddy makes a mark as well. Speaking of Anal Arasu's stunt choreography, it should be a delight for Vijay's fans and the star's celebrated screen presence and agility come to the fore in these extended treats.To sum up, Kaththi is a grand production which rides on Vijay's dual roles, the social interest angle and some impactful scenes which are part of the mix.",class movie with sharp social message,vijay r murugadoss are back with their second outing together kaththi film features vijay two contrasting but physically identical dual roles kathiresan jeevanantham while kathir is crook who is run one with 24 previous visits jail jeevanantham is sober educated activist who strives betterment his impoverished village where water is big concern their paths cross very early movie film is set motion vijay has used this opportunity play diverse roles same movie proves his experience as performer as entertainer while kathir is high theatrics is vijay that we have enjoyed screen many mass entertainers jeeva is fresh non vijay every aspect kathir is bound be fan favorite while audiences are likely empathize with jeeva his motives that aspect kaththi is strong movie actor vijay coming director r murugadoss he has touched upon many issues close his heart such as rampant corruption farmer suicides plight senior citizens water scarcity workings sensational news hungry media also goes vilify corporates their aggressive expansion plans without considering their csr corporate social responsibility initiatives one scene late second half when vijay delivers intense monologue above mentioned issues is definite highlight overall scheme things but it does try get little manipulative as director has played gallery win audiences sympathy towards farmers make us root his protagonist one feels murugadoss could have gone step forward tightened screenplay placement all songs leaves lot be desired specially much talked about selfie pulla aathi is delightfully shot whereas pakkam vandu though different exercise doesnt make impact but dancer vijay sparkles effortlessly all these songs kaththi doesnt engage consistently as some sizzling moments are interspersed with moments restlessness length movie is another drawback thuppakki hangover continues kaththi extent if thuppakki was ode army kaththi is dedicated farmers land anirudh as usual adds lot strength through his bgm score if you hear theatre roar some strong scenes major part credit should go him other youngster board dop george c williams makes smooth transition big commercial space with some solid work visuals lighting patterns angles among other performers neil nitin mukesh is new addition list suave stylish villains his voice dubbing elevate his overall performance samantha is sadly what you may call typical commercial cinema heroine who appears songs few romantic scenes stands background while hero takes charge all actors who play pivotal senior citizens are convincing sathish as vijays buddy makes mark as well speaking anal arasus stunt choreography it should be delight vijays fans stars celebrated screen presence agility come fore these extended treats sum up kaththi is grand production which rides vijays dual roles social interest angle some impactful scenes which are part mix,0.4011511544011544,0.12682828282828285,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10,Kaththi-Best of Vijay & AR Murugadoss,"Stop wasting your time in reading reviews, you just don't want miss the best of Vijay & AR Murugadoss, If you still want to know something then read on...Water Scarcity for farming resulting in farmers suicide, Disrespecting elderly people, Media's hunger for TRP, Corporate/MNC's domination, City people ignoring villager's issue.. Well these are the various issues highlighted in the movie while the farmers issue being the main theme. Murugadoss is a master of screenplay and good concepts (like how he developed ACF in Ramana, 7am Arivu theme, 12 on 12 in Thuppakki) and this movie has some good sequences. He starts with bits & pieces and post Aathi song the movie picks up and ends with a bang. The technical dept is brilliant like Thuppaki, DOP George u rock man u r the future,I bet u wont miss Santhosh Sivan.. Anirudh's first big movie and he delivers well in Songs & BGM.. Sreekar Prasad continues from where he left in Thuppakki. Excellent Action sequences by Anal Arasu.. especially coin fight where he delivers a logical way of how a single person can fight 50 people,am stunned coz in Thuppaki too the fight sequences made sense,hats off to Murugadoss for it.NOTE: Only in Thuppaki & Kaththi you can find a hero getting tired after fighting.Vijay's performance as Jeevanandham & Kathiresan is excellent, the performance comes from body language,mannerism and Vijay is bang on.Get up change is not needed.. According to me he is the best for facial expressions..woww.. let it be the cute reaction after slapping Samantha or Mocking Neil Nitin after Killing him.Neil Nitin is typical corporate Amul Baby, Excellent dubbing in his own voice for a first time Hindi actor in tamil.. now thats goodSpecial mention tp all the elderly people, they have done well.Excellent choreos for songs, Paalam song & A fight sequence were removed to make sure movie is speedy enough.The downsides are Samantha & Song placements.Apart from Vijay fans.. post Ghilli 2004 probably Sachein 2005 & Thuppakki 2012 were widely appreciated Vijay films.. Remaining were either liked only by few or some had issues with remakes (come on everyone does remakes) But Kaththi will be liked by everyone...Vijay & ARM has Nailed it.

8,Kaththi is a must-watch Vijay film,"A.R.Murugadoss who made a strong and intense social message film, Ramana, is stepping back in the same shoes with Kaththi but this time with a different treatment. If you already watched Ramana, you will come to know that Ramana wasn't an entertainer but a very serious film that speaks loudly about corruption in India. In Kaththi, he tries to make a social message film but within the usual Vijay film template which might be something new to witness on screen. Vijay hasn't tried much in doing films that focus on social issues. Let's see how Kaththi worked? Speaking about the farmer's issues, Kaththi's main purpose is to create awareness about the importance of water and farmers in our society. A.R.Murugadoss builds smartly a film that would not only deliver the message but also satisfy the hardcore Vijay fans and create a huge impact after watching it. Speaking about Vijay, he is a real entertainer. He makes us laugh, smile, and most importantly cry. He is playing a dual role in this film: one as an escaped prisoner Kathiresan and another as a hydrologist from the village Jeevanandham. Having no big differences in the looks, Vijay differentiated these roles through his effortless and impactful performance. It's worth mentioning that Vijay's performance lifts this film to a great extent and it's definitely one of his best performances to date. Vijay as Kathiresan was electrifying on-screen with Anirudh's fire cracking background score. It's again a superhero kind role but it has some grey shades which is interesting to watch on screen. I definitely want to speak about the Jeevanandham character. He is innocent and soft-hearted. He wants to fight against the corporate but he is overshadowed by the betrayal of those who he trusted wholeheartedly. The scene where he says ""Yen Uyire Ponaalum, Vivasayatha Vitrathinga"" is hard-hitting and so emotional. There's interesting emotional connectivity between his character and the audience which serves as a huge pillar for this film. Vijay's performance as Jeevanandham will be remembered forever. Other than Vijay, there are few supporting actors who had left a strong performance in the film. The main antagonist, Neil Nithin Mukesh, has delivered a good performance in his very first Tamil film. Coming to A.R.Murugadoss, he has made one of the best films of his career. After Ramana, this is definitely a film that would stand unique for its strong content and social awareness. The film is properly packaged as a wholesome entertainer. One of the major drawbacks of this film is the song placement right after the strong and intense interval. I felt that it just letdowns the intensity of the narrative unnecessarily. Apart from that, I feel that A.R.Murugadoss worked well in his writing and delivered a strong film. Overall, Kaththi is a must-watch Vijay film.",kaththi is must watch vijay film,r murugadoss who made strong intense social message film ramana is stepping back same shoes with kaththi but this time with different treatment if you already watched ramana you will come know that ramana wasnt entertainer but very serious film that speaks loudly about corruption india kaththi he tries make social message film but within usual vijay film template which might be something new witness screen vijay hasnt tried much doing films that focus social issues lets see how kaththi worked speaking about farmers issues kaththis main purpose is create awareness about importance water farmers our society r murugadoss builds smartly film that would not only deliver message but also satisfy hardcore vijay fans create huge impact after watching it speaking about vijay he is real entertainer he makes us laugh smile most importantly cry he is playing dual role this film one as escaped prisoner kathiresan another as hydrologist village jeevanandham having no big differences looks vijay differentiated these roles through his effortless impactful performance its worth mentioning that vijays performance lifts this film great extent its definitely one his best performances date vijay as kathiresan was electrifying screen with anirudhs fire cracking background score its again superhero kind role but it has some grey shades which is interesting watch screen i definitely want speak about jeevanandham character he is innocent soft hearted he wants fight against corporate but he is overshadowed by betrayal those who he trusted wholeheartedly scene where he says yen uyire ponaalum vivasayatha vitrathinga is hard hitting so emotional theres interesting emotional connectivity between his character audience which serves as huge pillar this film vijays performance as jeevanandham will be remembered forever other than vijay there are few supporting actors who had left strong performance film main antagonist neil nithin mukesh has delivered good performance his very first tamil film coming r murugadoss he has made one best films his career after ramana this is definitely film that would stand unique its strong content social awareness film is properly packaged as wholesome entertainer one major drawbacks this film is song placement right after strong intense interval i felt that it just letdowns intensity narrative unnecessarily apart that i feel that r murugadoss worked well his writing delivered strong film overall kaththi is must watch vijay film,0.4608836056416702,0.19084188660801563,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.4}"

7,A GOOD ONE TIME WATCH !!,"Director A.R. Murugadoss is largely successful in presenting story with a socially relevant theme weaved into a superstar action blockbuster narrative.Vijay, in a double role, looks better than ever and has tried to flex some acting muscle too. While Anirudh's background score is rocking in several sequences, the same cannot be said about his songs.While movies which are star vehicles generally lack logic and try to mint money by through sheer superhuman characterisation of the star, Murugadoss, despite succumbing to much of those demands, deserves kudos for harnessing the star power to underline important issues like livelihood of farmers and market-driven media within a structure of a masala entertainer.The length of the movie is a definite dampener, especially those from a bloated first half (Diwali overeating ??) which could've been culled by Sreekar Prasad. Alas, it seems his hands were tied by supposed ""Commercial"" constraints.Overall, if it had been trimmer by at least 30 minutes, this is one Kaththi (knife) which would've been sharper and could've pierced deeper !!

8,A Brave and Daring attempt by ARM and Thalapathy which payed off extremely well!!,"First half is a bit on the slow side but ARM made some twists and turns to keep you out of getting bored. Acting performance of Vijay in differentiating between Jeevanandham and Kathiresan made the day. Tailor made script & role for Vijay. As a movie, it almost reached the standard of Thupaaki but the message will penetrate into peoples heart than a sharp injection! ARM and ilayathalapathy need a bigger appreciation as they took a very brave attempt! hats off! Anirudh just rocked throughout be it a song or BGM! Placing of Aadhi and Selfie pulla song is not good but one can enjoy those songs! but still there is something missing and it is the role of the second villain. but one can understand that as the movie has to be cutoff within 3 hrs. Neil did a good job for his role! way to go! Samantha didn't have much scope for acting but her role is very important here. She was cute and did well in presenting herself.

9,Vijay's Mass meets with Class,"Kaththi-->> A film which takes a dig on the most important issue in India. How corporate effects and affects agriculture? Is the main motto of the film. Hats off to Vijay and ARM for taking up this serious issue and produced in a decent manner. Content and Performances-->> Vijay as Jeevanantham and Kathiresan has shown lots of improvement in his acting and variation for both the characters. This film will stand out as the Vijay's best acting performance till date. Vijay's voice modulation and dialogue delivery is top-notch. Samantha, Neil, Sathish has given justice to their small roles. Vijay at 40 yrs looks very young and stylish. His electrifying dance moves will make his fans go crazy. Positives:- Vijay's acting is the main positive in this film. Vijay has given some poor performances in his previous leader like films such as Sura, Kuruvi. But this film shows Vijay as an matured actor. Strong story, way of presentation, Coin fight scene, Tunnel scene,Blue print, Flash back and Press meet are Excellent. DOP of George.C.Williams is notable. Music:- Anirudh, the new sensation has delivered only an average audio album but his BGM is once again outstanding. Weakness:- Song Placements should have been better. The CG work towards the climax scene showcasing both Vijay's is very poor. Interval block with Vijay's ""I m Waiting"" may be avoided even though fans go crazy at this scene. Vijay's Performance:- 9.5/10 (I reduced 0.5 for interval block) Direction:- 10/10 ( Hats off to AR. Murugadoss) Film:- 9/10 Verdict:- A film with good message and excellent performances. Must watch for everyone and a treat for Vijay fans.

6,Good movie with a Society-oriented story.,"So a Diwali - Vijay Entertainer.OVERALL REVIEW : Yes. A good movie with a social thought for all. Good acting by Vijay, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Satish. Decent story and good direction. Amazing cinematography and crisp dialogues make the movie a pleasure to watch. Amazing Music and Awesome BGM. Bad heroine acting. Movies Similar to it: Citizen , Thamizhan , Ramana.MOVIE RATING : 6/10 MOVIE WITHOUT SAMANTHA : 7/10IN-DEPTH REVIEW (SPOILER ALERT):1. STORY:First half: The movie starts off with Vijay (Kathiresan), a prisoner helping the cops catch a thief who has just escaped the prison. When his job is done, Kathiresan just vanishes and the story moves on. With a few unnecessary scenes of the heroine introduction and other stuff that is totally irrelevant, the director finally comes back to the story in a while when Satish (Dhanu) and Kathiresan see people shoot at an innocent fellow in an auto rickshaw. They decide to rescue him and to their shock, the guy who was shot looks exactly like Kathiresan. They come to know that his name is Jeevanandam ( Vijay's double action). Kathiresan immediately decides to pretend like Jeevanandam and makes things appear like Jeevanandam is Kathiresan to avoid the cops chasing him. Kathiresan (who people assume to be Jeevanandam) then comes to an Old-Age home where he is brought to by the District Collector (somehow, don't question). Kathiresan wants money and decides to stay for it. Cedric Peter Von (more like Viktor Von Doom) (Neil NItin Mukesh) plays a typical MNC CEO who is ready to do anything for the company. Jeevanandam is arrested by the police and kept in jail. Kathiresan however slowly comes to know the real story of Jeevanandam and the pain he has gone through for his village and the farmers in his village. Kathiresan decides to help the old farmers as Jeevanandam and starts his fight for the right.The first half ends with the THUPPAKKI QUOTE - ""I am waiting""Second Half:After numerous attempts by Neil Nitin Mukesh to kill Kathiresan( they think Jeevanandam) failed, the story begins to move quick when Kathiresan uses his extravagant skill to fight for the farmers. The entire story revolves around the fact that the farmers in a village deep south are devoid of water for farming and an MNC Cola Factory has encroached the farmer's property by illegal means.Jeevanandam escapes the prison with the help of a few people and returns to Chennai when he comes to know everything. Kathiresan fights till the end as Jeevanandam and wins the case for the farmers but however leaves the place giving all credit to Jeevanandam, and finally accepts his mistake and returns to jail.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:1. The Heroine, Samantha ( I don't want to talk about her) 2. A bit quicker story build. 3. Rectification of very minor forgivable logical flaws in the movie. WHAT WAS GOOD:1. Vijay 2. Anirudh's Music and BGM 3. Direction",good movie with society oriented story,so diwali vijay entertainer overall review yes good movie with social thought all good acting by vijay neil nitin mukesh satish decent story good direction amazing cinematography crisp dialogues make movie pleasure watch amazing music awesome bgm bad heroine acting movies similar it citizen thamizhan ramana movie rating 6 10 movie without samantha 7 10in depth review spoiler alert 1 story first half movie starts off with vijay kathiresan prisoner helping cops catch thief who has just escaped prison when his job is done kathiresan just vanishes story moves with few unnecessary scenes heroine introduction other stuff that is totally irrelevant director finally comes back story while when satish dhanu kathiresan see people shoot at innocent fellow auto rickshaw they decide rescue him their shock guy who was shot looks exactly like kathiresan they come know that his name is jeevanandam vijays double action kathiresan immediately decides pretend like jeevanandam makes things appear like jeevanandam is kathiresan avoid cops chasing him kathiresan who people assume be jeevanandam then comes old age home where he is brought by district collector somehow dont question kathiresan wants money decides stay it cedric peter von more like viktor von doom neil nitin mukesh plays typical mnc ceo who is ready do anything company jeevanandam is arrested by police kept jail kathiresan however slowly comes know real story jeevanandam pain he has gone through his village farmers his village kathiresan decides help old farmers as jeevanandam starts his fight right first half ends with thuppakki quote i am waiting second half after numerous attempts by neil nitin mukesh kill kathiresan they think jeevanandam failed story begins move quick when kathiresan uses his extravagant skill fight farmers entire story revolves around fact that farmers village deep south are devoid water farming mnc cola factory has encroached farmers property by illegal means jeevanandam escapes prison with help few people returns chennai when he comes know everything kathiresan fights till end as jeevanandam wins case farmers but however leaves place giving all credit jeevanandam finally accepts his mistake returns jail what could be better 1 heroine samantha i dont want talk about her 2 bit quicker story build 3 rectification very minor forgivable logical flaws movie what was good 1 vijay 2 anirudhs music bgm 3 direction,0.3960544217687076,0.10736394557823126,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.3}"
