1,Flop show,"Other reviewers have already pointed out many blatant historical inaccuracies. This movie is one of many recent Indian movies that claims to be based on historical events but is based on folklore. The formula is a simple fake narrative: muslims were good for nothing and only won through treachery (for over 600 years lol), hindus were chivalrous but kept losing because of high morals (for over 600 years lollol) , all text book history is biased (just cause it doesn't suit them), and none should question imagined 'facts' because falsifying is for the greater nationalistic good (movie is tax free in some Indian states).What is even more bizarre is how some reviewers are dissatisfied with 7/10 level of falsification and are demanding for 10/10 max pro level fake. Lying to themselves, making a mockery and eroding the trust of their own people.",flop show,other reviewers have already pointed out many blatant historical inaccuracies this movie is one many recent indian movies that claims be based historical events but is based folklore formula is simple fake narrative muslims were good nothing only won through treachery over 600 years lol hindus were chivalrous but kept losing because high morals over 600 years lollol all text book history is biased just cause it doesnt suit them none should question imagined facts because falsifying is greater nationalistic good movie is tax free some indian states what is even more bizarre is how some reviewers are dissatisfied with 7 10 level falsification are demanding 10 10 max pro level fake lying themselves making mockery eroding trust their own people,0.5661071428571429,0.20675,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.35}"
