10.0,Essential masterpiece; powerful De Niro; simply one of the best films of all time.,"""Raging Bull"" isn't the average, stereotypical underdog boxing movie, because it isn't really about boxing at all. Like most great movies, its focus is much deeper. It came out in 1980, earned Robert De Niro a Best Actor Academy Award, and was marked down as another solid triumph by director Martin Scorsese, whose previous 1976 outing with De Niro earned them both critical acclaim (and for De Niro, an Oscar nomination, although he would actually earn an Oscar for ""Raging Bull"" four years later).It dwindled in production hell for quite some time, with Scorsese's drug use halting production and only the duo's strong willpower that kept the project moving ahead. It was after De Niro read boxer Jake LaMotta's memoirs that he knew he wanted to make the film, so Scorsese and De Niro turned to Paul Schrader for a script. Schrader, who had previously written ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), agreed, and wrote the screenplay for them. The rest is history.""Raging Bull"" has often been regarded as the greatest film of the 80s. To be honest, I'm not so sure about that, since various genres offer different feelings and emotions (comparing this to a comedy might seem rather silly). But to say it is one of the most powerful films of all time would be no gross overstatement -- it is superb film-making at its finest.De Niro gained 60 pounds to play LaMotta, which was an all-time record at the time (later beaten by Vincent D'Onofrio, who gained 70 pounds for Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket""). His physical transformation is on-par with any great screen makeover, especially the most recent, ranging from Willem Dafoe in ""Shadow of the Vampire"" to Charlize Theron in ""Monster."" In addition, co-star Joe Pesci also lost weight for his role of Joey, LaMotta's short, eccentric brother. The greatest scene in the film is when LaMotta accuses his brother of having an affair with his wife. The tension is raw, the dialogue amazing, and the overall intensity electrifying.The film is most often compared to ""Rocky,"" more than any other, apparently because they both concern a certain level of boxing. As much as I absolutely adore ""Rocky,"" ""Raging Bull"" is a deeper, more realistic film. But whereas ""Raging Bull"" is raw, ""Rocky"" is inspiring, and that is one of the reasons I do not think these two very different motion pictures deserve comparison, for the simple fact that they are entirely separate from one another. The only connecting thread is the apparently central theme of boxing, which is used as a theme in ""Rocky,"" and a backdrop in ""Raging Bull."" They're entirely different motion pictures -- one uplifting, the other somewhat depressing -- and the people who try to decide which is better need to seriously re-evaluate their reasons for doing so. They both succeed splendidly well at what they are trying to do, and that's all I have to say about their so-called connection.De Niro, who could justifiably be called the greatest actor of all time, is at the top of his game here. In ""Taxi Driver"" he displayed a top-notch performance. He wasn't just playing Travis Bickle -- he was Travis Bickle. And here he is Jake LaMotta, the infamous boxer known for his abusive life style and somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion, 1949 - 1951. Throughout the film, he beats his wife (played expertly and convincingly by the 19-year-old Cathy Moriarty), convinced that she is cheating on him, and that is more or less what the film is truly about. The boxing is just what he does for a living, and could be considered as a way to release some of his deeper, harbored anger.LaMotta has a close relationship with Joey, his brother, and their interaction is often what elevates the film above others of its genre. The dialogue is great, close to the perfection of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" rich in that rapid-fire filthy language and brutal insults. Pesci, who was on the verge of quitting showbiz at the time of pre-production, was spotted by De Niro in a cheap B-movie named ""The Death Collector"" (1975), a.k.a. ""Family Business,"" a truly horrid film that nevertheless showcased an early sign of things to come for Pesci. De Niro wanted him for the movie and his premonition was either very lucky or very wise -- this is one of the best performances of Pesci's entire career.Scorsese shot the film in muted black and white, portraying a certain era of depression and misery. To make the blood show up on screen during the occasional fight scenes, Scorsese used Hershey's Syrup -- which is an interesting tidbit of trivia for any aspiring film-making planning on filming a violent movie in black and white. But how often does that happen?This is certainly one of the most intense films Scorsese has directed, and one of the most important of his career. Along with ""Taxi Driver,"" it is an iconic motion picture that will stand the test of time for years and years to come. Scorsese and De Niro's partnership over the years has resulted in some of the most influential and utterly amazing motion pictures of all time: ""Mean Streets,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The King of Comedy,"" ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" come to mind almost instantly. But perhaps the one single title that will be remembered as their most daring effort is ""Raging Bull,"" a motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description. It is simply a masterpiece for the mind and senses, leaving you knocked out cold after its brutal one-two punch. If I had to assemble a list of required viewing, this would be up there towards the top.",essential masterpiece powerful de niro simply one best films all time,raging bull isnt average stereotypical underdog boxing movie because it isnt really about boxing at all like most great movies its focus is much deeper it came out 1980 earned robert de niro best actor academy award was marked down as another solid triumph by director martin scorsese whose previous 1976 outing with de niro earned them both critical acclaim de niro oscar nomination although he would actually earn oscar raging bull four years later it dwindled production hell quite some time with scorseses drug use halting production only duos strong willpower that kept project moving ahead it was after de niro read boxer jake lamottas memoirs that he knew he wanted make film so scorsese de niro turned paul schrader script schrader who had previously written taxi driver 1976 agreed wrote screenplay them rest is history raging bull has often been regarded as greatest film 80s be honest im not so sure about that since various genres offer different feelings emotions comparing this comedy might seem rather silly but say it is one most powerful films all time would be no gross overstatement it is superb film making at its finest de niro gained 60 pounds play lamotta which was all time record at time later beaten by vincent donofrio who gained 70 pounds stanley kubricks full metal jacket his physical transformation is par with any great screen makeover especially most recent ranging willem dafoe shadow vampire charlize theron monster addition co star joe pesci also lost weight his role joey lamottas short eccentric brother greatest scene film is when lamotta accuses his brother having affair with his wife tension is raw dialogue amazing overall intensity electrifying film is most often compared rocky more than any other apparently because they both concern certain level boxing as much as i absolutely adore rocky raging bull is deeper more realistic film but whereas raging bull is raw rocky is inspiring that is one reasons i do not think these two very different motion pictures deserve comparison simple fact that they are entirely separate one another only connecting thread is apparently central theme boxing which is used as theme rocky backdrop raging bull theyre entirely different motion pictures one uplifting other somewhat depressing people who try decide which is better need seriously re evaluate their reasons doing so they both succeed splendidly well at what they are trying do thats all i have say about their so called connection de niro who could justifiably be called greatest actor all time is at top his game here taxi driver he displayed top notch performance he wasnt just playing travis bickle he was travis bickle here he is jake lamotta infamous boxer known his abusive life style somewhat paranoid delusions during his reign as world middleweight boxing champion 1949 1951 throughout film he beats his wife played expertly convincingly by 19 year old cathy moriarty convinced that she is cheating him that is more or less what film is truly about boxing is just what he does living could be considered as way release some his deeper harbored anger lamotta has close relationship with joey his brother their interaction is often what elevates film above others its genre dialogue is great close perfection quentin tarantinos pulp fiction rich that rapid fire filthy language brutal insults pesci who was verge quitting showbiz at time pre production was spotted by de niro cheap b movie named death collector 1975 k family business truly horrid film that nevertheless showcased early sign things come pesci de niro wanted him movie his premonition was either very lucky or very wise this is one best performances pescis entire career scorsese shot film muted black white portraying certain era depression misery make blood show up screen during occasional fight scenes scorsese used hersheys syrup which is interesting tidbit trivia any aspiring film making planning filming violent movie black white but how often does that happen this is certainly one most intense films scorsese has directed one most important his career along with taxi driver it is iconic motion picture that will stand test time years years come scorsese de niros partnership over years has resulted some most influential utterly amazing motion pictures all time mean streets taxi driver king comedy goodfellas casino come mind almost instantly but perhaps one single title that will be remembered as their most daring effort is raging bull motion picture so utterly exhilarating that it defies description it is simply masterpiece mind senses leaving you knocked out cold after its brutal one two punch if i had assemble list required viewing this would be up there towards top,0.5652534410034409,0.17615304140304136,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"
5.0,Scorcese robbed,"Well, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in my entire life, but there it is.I realize that this film lost to ""Ordinary People,"" a film I love. I am not an idiot - I know that Martin Scorcese is a great, very gifted artist who puts powerful images on the screen. I agree that he has been cheated out of the Academy Award many times, which makes one realize they don't count for much. For DeNiro, this stands as one of the greatest performances of all time. DeNiro is one of a handful of American actors who has earned his place at the top - he's there with Brando, Pacino, and Newman. ""Raging Bull"" helped put him there. As far as the rest of the acting, Cathy Moriarity epitomizes the '40s blond and a Bronx woman, and Joe Pesci is perfect as LaMotta's brother.Scorcese presents here the turbulent life of Jake Lamotta with all its brutality, sparing us nothing in his fights, his anger against his wives, his brother, no one. His obsessive nature, his jealousy, his - well, hey, his rage - does not make him a likable character. LaMotta himself was disturbed by how he came off on screen, but then had the honesty to admit that he was a bastard.Scorcese creates the Bronx and the bloody horror of the fight ring in a way no one else ever has. The first shot of the lone boxer in the ring is stunning, as is the real LaMotta's own practicing of a speech in a dressing room. Everything about this film evinces the aura of a special era, especially the color home movies - a brilliant touch.The only problem I had with the film was that it was boring and unwatchable. I finally got so sick of all the screaming and yelling and watching this unlikeable, obnoxious character that I turned the set off. I thought if he tortured his wife one more time asking her if she slept with his brother, I was going to put my fist through the set.This is the age-old question - you know something is great art but it doesn't speak to you. You like something that's very well done but a little less artistic better - does this means you are one of the masses for whom mediocrity has become your idea of what's good? I don't know. I like to think I can appreciate a beautifully made film. But I think what I can appreciate more than that are complicated characters I understand on some level - or want to understand, real emotions, real heartache - probably more than magnificent film-making. When there is both, it's magic. For me, ""Raging Bull"" was not one of those times. ""Godfather I,"" ""Godfather II,"" yes.

,Scorsese's Best? De Niro's Best? The 1980s' Best? Probably on All Three,"""Raging Bull"" is a cinematic masterpiece which pulls no punches. Based on a true story, Robert De Niro (in his second Oscar-winning role) stars as Jake La Motta, a middle-weight prize-fighter from the late-1940s and early-1950s, who basically destroys himself and those around him because of an uncontrollable temper and poor decision-making. Instead of going down as one of the greatest boxers of all time, La Motta ruined his career because he was unable to see the ""big picture"". He threw bouts, he got involved with low-life underworld crime figures, he beat his wife (Cathy Moriarty, in her Oscar-nominated role), he abused all those closest to him, and he had relationships with young girls who were still considered minors. Even his strongest tie, his younger brother (Joe Pesci, in an Oscar-nominated, star-making part), gets cut during the course of his untimely self-destruction. La Motta goes from middle-weight champ to a washed-out stand-up comic at a local club. He gains weight uncontrollably and ultimately just becomes another face in the crowd by the end of the film. By the end, La Motta proclaims that he: ""Could have been a contender...."", quoting Marlon Brando's famous line from ""On the Waterfront"". ""Raging Bull"" is one of those films that is masterfully crafted in all possible departments. The screenplay is one of the best in the history of film. Martin Scorsese's direction is superb and so is the cinematography (shot almost entirely in black-and-white). The film delivered De Niro an Oscar and also won for its editing. ""Raging Bull"" is one of those films that is very close to ""Citizen Kane"". They both deal with men who desperately want to be great, but ultimately destroy themselves and those around them. This film is often rated the best film of the 1980s. I cannot argue with that opinion. I also think that this is the best work that Scorsese and De Niro have ever done. The fact that this film lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""Ordinary People"" in 1980 is probably the biggest disappointment since ""Citizen Kane"" lost to ""How Green Was My Valley"" in 1941.

,Classic examination of masculinity,"The story of boxer Jake La Motta from his rising star in the 1940's through to his own downfall and his eventual living on the cabaret circuit in the present day.Scorsese and De Niro  nobody needs say any more. Whether it be media satire (King of Comedy), small time thugs (Mean Streets) or real gangsta s**t (Goodfellas), the two rarely miss. This was one of their best to date (and probably for ever). The story is fascinating in itself but as an examination of masculinity it excels. The film allows us to watch a man who goes along with all the things he thinks make him a man  even when those characteristics and habits begin to destroy everything he has  his marriage, his realtionships and his career. Combine this with the gripping boxing tale of ups and downs and you have a film that never outstays it's welcome.Scorsese is on top form  the use of black and white any have been a quality issue, but he uses it well. The fight scenes are other worldly  exaggerated to the extent that it is breathtaking and more shocking than previous boxing scenes in other movies. My favourite effect is the sound editing in the fights where silence and calm seem to descend just before key moments..amazing. The relationship stuff is also gripping and Scorsese handles he human cost just as well as he shows us the physical beatings.De Niro is amazing  the method stuff alone is great, but his whole performance is intense. Similarly Moriaty, Pesci and Frank Vincent are excellent  however they all stand in De Niro's shadow.Overall  an excellent film on so many levels, as a story, as a examination of masculinity, as a sports film, as a lesson in direction and editing..this excels in so many ways  may it never drop out of the top ten from the twentieth century!",classic examination masculinity,story boxer jake la motta his rising star 1940s through his own downfall his eventual living cabaret circuit present day scorsese de niro nobody needs say any more whether it be media satire king comedy small time thugs mean streets or real gangsta s t goodfellas two rarely miss this was one their best date probably ever story is fascinating itself but as examination masculinity it excels film allows us watch man who goes along with all things he thinks make him man even when those characteristics habits begin destroy everything he has his marriage his realtionships his career combine this with gripping boxing tale ups downs you have film that never outstays its welcome scorsese is top form use black white any have been quality issue but he uses it well fight scenes are other worldly exaggerated extent that it is breathtaking more shocking than previous boxing scenes other movies my favourite effect is sound editing fights where silence calm seem descend just before key moments amazing relationship stuff is also gripping scorsese handles he human cost just as well as he shows us physical beatings de niro is amazing method stuff alone is great but his whole performance is intense similarly moriaty pesci frank vincent are excellent however they all stand de niros shadow overall excellent film so many levels as story as examination masculinity as sports film as lesson direction editing this excels so many ways may it never drop out top ten twentieth century,0.5618339002267574,0.2624007936507936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.22}"
8.0,Bovine Pugilist & Paranoid Misogynist...,"There's very little to like about the character portrayed here by Robert De Niro, other than to acknowledge that he took advantage of one of the few things he was good at i.e. thumping anyone who enraged him regardless of whether they were in the boxing ring or not.The power of the movie comes from De Niro under the direction of Martin Scorsese, providing a wholly convincing performance of the furious, bitter, bovine pugilist with serious psychological issues. It is one of the truly great performances of that decade, perhaps of all time, nailing the establishment of a character it's genuinely difficult to have any empathy or sympathy with. If you dig deeper, you will not be surprised to find a serial misogynist who married seven times and who beat all of his wives. If this is your type of hero you might like to reconsider how you got there.

,Impressive From A Filmmaking Standpoint But Lacking Flavour In Narration,"Bringing the life story of one of the roughest brawlers to ever step into the boxing ring, Raging Bull finds director Martin Scorsese & actor Robert De Niro teaming up once again to deliver yet another quality work but just like their other collaborations, it left me cold & indifferent to whatever it had in store and while I respect the legacy of this sports drama, I'm no fan of it.Raging Bull chronicles the life of Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxer whose rage, jealously & bouts of violent outbursts helps propel him to the top of the division but his inability to keep those vicious tendencies in check outside the arena leads him on a path of self-destruction, as he destroys his relationships with his wife & family over the years and wounds up all alone in his later life.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film is incredibly faithful to its source material and recreates the events with accuracy. Shot in black & white, which gives the picture a timeless quality, it illustrates the good, bad & ugly side of LaMotta with finesse and his arc is undeniably compelling. But he also comes off as an insufferable persona whose problems are of his own making which makes his downward journey all the more deserving.What also affects the experience is that the story remains a monotonous ride for the entirety of its runtime. There is no escalation whatsoever whether we are witnessing LaMotta's boxing bouts or personal life. It's just a similar set of events repeated time n again for 125 minutes and that's not enough to keep the interest alive. It's brutal & violent in the ring but it fails to deliver the desired emotional impact because we are just not invested in his journey.However, from a filmmaking standpoint, Raging Bull is an outstanding piece of work. The staging of events, the era-appropriate set pieces, the boxing choreography, the controlled camerawork, all of it exhibit an exactness that's quite commendable. And as for the performances, Robert De Niro leads the show from the front and delivers a smashing showcase as Jake LaMotta, and he is brilliantly supported by Joe Pesci & Cathy Moriarty who play his brother & wife respectively.On an overall scale, Raging Bull is impressive in its craftsmanship but the narration is lacking in flavour and becomes repetitive after a while. Scorsese's direction & De Niro's commitment to his role certainly stand out but the longer it goes on, the more wearisome it becomes. Painting a faithful portrait of a character with no redeeming characteristics, Raging Bull is significant from a filmmaking viewpoint but there isn't much to gain by investing in someone who refuses to learn from his own mistakes.",impressive filmmaking standpoint but lacking flavour narration,bringing life story one roughest brawlers ever step into boxing ring raging bull finds director martin scorsese actor robert de niro teaming up once again deliver yet another quality work but just like their other collaborations it left me cold indifferent whatever it had store while i respect legacy this sports drama im no fan it raging bull chronicles life jake lamotta middleweight boxer whose rage jealously bouts violent outbursts helps propel him top division but his inability keep those vicious tendencies check outside arena leads him path self destruction as he destroys his relationships with his wife family over years wounds up all alone his later life directed by martin scorsese film is incredibly faithful its source material recreates events with accuracy shot black white which gives picture timeless quality it illustrates good bad ugly side lamotta with finesse his arc is undeniably compelling but he also comes off as insufferable persona whose problems are his own making which makes his downward journey all more deserving what also affects experience is that story remains monotonous ride entirety its runtime there is no escalation whatsoever whether we are witnessing lamottas boxing bouts or personal life its just similar set events repeated time n again 125 minutes thats not enough keep interest alive its brutal violent ring but it fails deliver desired emotional impact because we are just not invested his journey however filmmaking standpoint raging bull is outstanding piece work staging events era appropriate set pieces boxing choreography controlled camerawork all it exhibit exactness thats quite commendable as performances robert de niro leads show front delivers smashing showcase as jake lamotta he is brilliantly supported by joe pesci cathy moriarty who play his brother wife respectively overall scale raging bull is impressive its craftsmanship but narration is lacking flavour becomes repetitive after while scorseses direction de niros commitment his role certainly stand out but longer it goes more wearisome it becomes painting faithful portrait character with no redeeming characteristics raging bull is significant filmmaking viewpoint but there isnt much gain by investing someone who refuses learn his own mistakes,0.5960622710622712,0.08263125763125763,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7.0,"Easy to Admire, Difficult to Love","The routine use of black-and-white film to make movies seems to have ended in the mid-sixties, probably killed off by the advent of colour television. Since then black-and-white has been used very sparingly; even Polanski's `Chinatown', obviously conceived as homage to the films noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, was shot in colour.`Raging Bull'- a biography of the boxer Jake La Motta who for a time held the world middleweight championship- is one of the few exceptions. The use of black-and-white seems to have been inspired by the fact that the film depicts real-life events that occurred in the forties and fifties. Scorsese has tried to capture the look of both the films and the newsreels of that period. This is remarkably effective for the boxing scenes, which have a raw, brutal power and graphically depict the aggressive nature of the sport. The other remarkable thing about the film is the performance of Robert de Niro, for which he won a well-deserved Best Actor Academy Award. De Niro actually learned to box for the film, and did all the boxing scenes himself without using a stunt double, but his portrayal of La Motta's private life is equally effective.Some boxers- Henry Cooper comes to mind- are hard-hitting inside the ring but gentlemanly and restrained outside. La Motta, as portrayed in this film, did not fall into this category. De Niro portrays him as a man with a very short fuse, seething with anger and violence. Unlike his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson, an elegant practitioner of the art of boxing, La Motta tries to overpower his rivals with brute force rather than relying on skill. His aggression is not something confined to the ring, but rather an inherent part of his personality, and comes out in his dealings with others. He treats his beautiful wife Vicki particularly badly, frequently (and irrationally) suspecting her of infidelity and subjecting her to both verbal and physical abuse. Besides De Niro's dominating performance, there are also very good contributions from Cathy Moriarty as Vicki and from Joe Pesci as La Motta's loyal brother Joey, another frequent target of abuse despite his loyalty.For me, this is a very good film, yet one that falls just short of the classic status that some have claimed for it. At times it is enthralling to watch, but at others, particularly in the first half, it seems to lack structure, as La Motta takes on a series of opponents without the significance of these fights ever becoming clear. More could have been made of the gambling-inspired corruption that infested the sport at this period and which may well have contributed to La Motta's sense of frustration- at one time it is made clear to him that his getting a chance to fight for the world title depends upon his taking a dive in a non-title fight. The main weakness, however, is a sense of emptiness at its centre, resulting from the lack of a character who can engage our sympathies. As I said, it is De Niro's performance that dominates the film, but for all his fine acting, even he cannot make us sympathise with a drunken, self-pitying, paranoid, violent wife-beater. As a character study of an unpleasant character it is excellent, but it can go no further than that.

10.0,It doesn't get much better than this,"Easily one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I have watched it at least ten times, and it only gets better and better with each viewing. Martin Scorsese is absolutely the greatest filmmaker of the last quarter century, and this film is his best. The story of how boxer Jake LaMotta watched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violent temper and deep-rooted misogyny is told with no punches pulled (excuse the bad pun), as Deniro (in what may be his best performance) and Scorsese unflinchingly explore what drove this man over the edge, and what ultimately may have pulled him back. The boxing scenes easily rank with the most brutal and violent moments ever put on film, shot in stark, unadorned black and white and utilizing unlikely sounds including shattering windows and animal cries to great effect. Thelma Schoonmaker's jarring, discordant editing in these scenes also deserves special mention. The scenes of domestic violence are not for the faint of heart, but there is really no other way to tell this story.

9.0,It really is harder to Stay At the Top than to Reach the Top; just because Life has No Justice.,"Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I'm sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can't expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black&white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It's not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo's paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. Raging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It's the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it's just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values. In Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn't like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn't care; 'cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history. At the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: ""A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!"". There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath.",it really is harder stay at top than reach top just because life has no justice,whoever is dissatisfied by raging bull im sure they watched it with expectations watching sports movie like rocky despite afi chose raging bull as sports movie all time you cant expect see most breathtaking boxing match nor witness best crochet boxing history raging bull can only be classified as drama biography director scorsese chose go with black white cinematography only keep young viewers away this masterpiece art its not fair compare rocky with raging bull rocky was populist movie mostly young viewers raging bull is cinematic masterpiece wide point view instance if you look at one michelangelos paintings at first you see nude woman if you look longer deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought if you look continuously give life it your imagination you discover that women are not just their bodies accordingly like it is not enough looking once painting understand what opinion does it defend it is not reasonable not fair watch raging bull so as see sports movie also it is not reasonable see raging bull only once raging bull is one movie that every time you watch it you get better taste every time you watch it you discover something new raging bull taught us that even if you are best at some skill even if you are best all you need create witnesses admirers supporters your skill its only way reach top moreover it is harder stay at top than reach top not because someone better than you can defeat you its just because need be accepted every authority like council judges media admiration people director scorsese draws benefit hypocrisy fame he empowers raging bull make people ask their conscience if popular values that people choose can really cherish their values raging bull jake la motta was best boxer all but people didnt like him he was disrespectful he was uncivilized he was very ugly he was arrogant he was irritable he didnt care cause he believed himself despite fact that he is best everybody disliked him soon he was left alone very short time he lost everything he possessed when he opened his eyes back life he found himself prison scene that he is punching butting wall facing him is one most heart rending memorable scenes whole cinema history at end he finally throws towel believing himself he loses his faith becomes learn what he never wanted learn fame he starts running his own business at night club under his name working as stand up comedian at stage people laugh at him jokes he made out his memories jokes paraphrasing bitter facts life including very famous joke british king richard iii which he said year 1485 just before dying horse horse my kingdom horse there we understand truly every joke there lies share fact underneath,0.5137274707862944,0.23058229352346998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.21, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,Some technical aspects of this cinematic masterpiece,"The first surprising thing about Raging Bull as a film is its black and white photography, with the only colour footage being the short home video sequence of La Motta's wedding. Originally, the decision to shoot the film in black and white was based specifically on cinematographer Michael Chapman and Martin Scorsese's memories of 1940's boxing bouts, which they remembered as black and white flash photos in magazines. People's memories of Jake La Motta's fights would have been black and white ones and therefore it seemed right to shoot in black and white, even though at first they had fears this would be seen as too pretentious. The particular visual intensity of the fight scenes, however, was partly due to financial difficulties rather than directorial choices. In an attempt to keep the picture on schedule, two separate lighting styles had to be adopted. Jake's life outside the ring would be kept as simple as possible, and this meant that the scenes in the ring could be concentrated on more. They would be shot entirely in the Los Angeles studio and would be highly stylised. This is how the dazzling visual nature of the fight scenes was allowed to come about. Scorsese, suffering from a low point in his career, was convinced this film would be his last and wanted to go out with a bang. Hence he decided to give the fighting scenes all he could, since he had nothing to lose anymore.What Scorsese disliked about the previous boxing films he had seen was the way the fights were shown from ringside, adopting a spectator's view, which protected the audience from the brutality inside the ring. For Raging Bull, Scorsese was determined to get as close as possible to the raw violence of the fights. He would film inside the ring and make the audience feel every punch. His plan was to shoot the fight scenes as if the viewers were the fighter, and their impressions were the fighter's, and never to insulate the audience from the violence in the ring. The viewers would think, feel, see and hear everything the boxers would. Aside from the opening fight, La Motta's first professional defeat against Jimmy Reeves, there would be no cuts to the baying of the crowd. For the Reeves fight Scorsese chose to include some chaotic backlash from the crowd showing their disapproval of the judge's decision, but apart from this scene, Scorsese's mantra throughout the film was 'Stay in the ring'. Each intricately choreographed fight would have a different style in order to reflect La Motta's different states of mind at the time of the fights. Jake La Motta was consultant for the film, and the fights were depicted as he remembered them. For example, in his second fight against Sugar Ray Robinson, the ring is wide and brightened by the radiant white of the canvas making the scene feel free and open, and a relatively comfortable atmosphere. This is because La Motta won this fight, a great victory against his great rival. In contrast to this, the ring in his next fight against Robinson, which he lost on a controversial decision, was designed by Scorsese as a 'pit of hell'. In the opening shot of this fight, Scorsese has made everything look unclear and indistinguishable. This time, the ring is very dark and smoky which increases the blurred, unfocused feel of the fight. Often during this fight, faces are out of frame. For example when the two men are boxing La Motta's face is often blurred out by smoke or hidden by his opponent's body. This is seen once again when he is in his corner for the break in between the rounds; the shot has his face completely covered by one of the ropes of the ring. This was how La Motta himself remembered it; these events will remain unclear in his mind since he could not work out why he had lost. This sequence depicts a particularly upsetting part of La Motta's memories, and perfectly illustrates how he was feeling at the moment of the fight.Just as important as the look of the film was the sound. As with the cinematography, two different styles were adopted to differentiate between La Motta's life in and out of the ring. The fight scenes were recorded in Dolby Stereo with heightened, often animalistic sound effects and a striking use of silence. This contrast with the dialogue in the film, which was recorded normally, was used to emphasise La Motta's heightened sense of awareness in the ring. The most memorable use of sound in the film, in particular the use of silence, is in La Motta's fourth fight against his great rival Sugar Ray Robinson. The rounds are punctuated by eery silence, giving an impression of slow motion and evoking the idea of what would be running through the boxers' heads. Just as memorable was the decision to use an animal's breathing for Robinson's final attack on La Motta. Everything is standing still, there is a striking silence throughout and all that can be heard is the bestial breathing building the suspense, as if Robinson was a lion about to strike on its prey. The next sequence is an extremely fast montage of cuts showing La Motta being badly beaten by Robinson. This scene moves between Robinson and La Motta at a rapid pace to suit the lightning fast boxing of which La Motta is on the receiving hand. This was carefully planned out and storyboarded beforehand by Scorsese and then skilfully brought to life by editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who won an Oscar for her work.",some technical aspects this cinematic masterpiece,first surprising thing about raging bull as film is its black white photography with only colour footage being short home video sequence la mottas wedding originally decision shoot film black white was based specifically cinematographer michael chapman martin scorseses memories 1940s boxing bouts which they remembered as black white flash photos magazines peoples memories jake la mottas fights would have been black white ones therefore it seemed right shoot black white even though at first they had fears this would be seen as too pretentious particular visual intensity fight scenes however was partly due financial difficulties rather than directorial choices attempt keep picture schedule two separate lighting styles had be adopted jakes life outside ring would be kept as simple as possible this meant that scenes ring could be concentrated more they would be shot entirely los angeles studio would be highly stylised this is how dazzling visual nature fight scenes was allowed come about scorsese suffering low point his career was convinced this film would be his last wanted go out with bang hence he decided give fighting scenes all he could since he had nothing lose anymore what scorsese disliked about previous boxing films he had seen was way fights were shown ringside adopting spectators view which protected audience brutality inside ring raging bull scorsese was determined get as close as possible raw violence fights he would film inside ring make audience feel every punch his plan was shoot fight scenes as if viewers were fighter their impressions were fighters never insulate audience violence ring viewers would think feel see hear everything boxers would aside opening fight la mottas first professional defeat against jimmy reeves there would be no cuts baying crowd reeves fight scorsese chose include some chaotic backlash crowd showing their disapproval judges decision but apart this scene scorseses mantra throughout film was stay ring each intricately choreographed fight would have different style order reflect la mottas different states mind at time fights jake la motta was consultant film fights were depicted as he remembered them example his second fight against sugar ray robinson ring is wide brightened by radiant white canvas making scene feel free open relatively comfortable atmosphere this is because la motta won this fight great victory against his great rival contrast this ring his next fight against robinson which he lost controversial decision was designed by scorsese as pit hell opening shot this fight scorsese has made everything look unclear indistinguishable this time ring is very dark smoky which increases blurred unfocused feel fight often during this fight faces are out frame example when two men are boxing la mottas face is often blurred out by smoke or hidden by his opponents body this is seen once again when he is his corner break between rounds shot has his face completely covered by one ropes ring this was how la motta himself remembered it these events will remain unclear his mind since he could not work out why he had lost this sequence depicts particularly upsetting part la mottas memories perfectly illustrates how he was feeling at moment fight just as important as look film was sound as with cinematography two different styles were adopted differentiate between la mottas life out ring fight scenes were recorded dolby stereo with heightened often animalistic sound effects striking use silence this contrast with dialogue film which was recorded normally was used emphasise la mottas heightened sense awareness ring most memorable use sound film particular use silence is la mottas fourth fight against his great rival sugar ray robinson rounds are punctuated by eery silence giving impression slow motion evoking idea what would be running through boxers heads just as memorable was decision use animals breathing robinsons final attack la motta everything is standing still there is striking silence throughout all that can be heard is bestial breathing building suspense as if robinson was lion about strike its prey next sequence is extremely fast montage cuts showing la motta being badly beaten by robinson this scene moves between robinson la motta at rapid pace suit lightning fast boxing which la motta is receiving hand this was carefully planned out storyboarded beforehand by scorsese then skilfully brought life by editor thelma schoonmaker who won oscar her work,0.47549867853665306,0.12409213149719478,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.37}"
4.0,Ostentatiously pretentious with a one-dimensional central character,"Certainly a contender for the most overrated film ever made. I like some of Martin Scorsese's work, but I have never understood the near hysterical reactions elicited by critics and his die-hard fans over his contributions to cinema which, much like Steven Spielberg, range from wonderful to embarrassing. To them, every Scorsese film is ""brilliant."" However, despite the reassurances of various critical associations and hero-worshipping fans all too willing to declare this the greatest film made in the last 30 years, most viewers may well wonder what all of the hoopla is about. The film is a biography of boxer Jake LaMotta and documents his volatile, tempestuous nature both in the boxing ring and in his personal life. There is no doubt that Robert DeNiro hurls himself heart and soul into this role, but much of the accolades heaped onto his work center on the arduous physical labors he endured to get himself into fighting shape for LaMotta at his prime and then make himself fat to depict LaMotta having gone to seed. One must admire his dedication, but it was hardly the first time an actor had gone to such efforts  people quickly forget the weight gains of actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf or Lynn Redgrave in Georgy Girl more than a decade prior to DeNiro in Raging Bull. Ironically, other than the physical, there is nothing to recommend LaMotta as a character around whom a movie should be centered. He greets every obstacle in his life, either person or event, by trying to batter it into bloody submission. There is no range to him and he is most certainly not a charismatic person. I certainly would not wish to spend more than a few moments in his presence much less the duration of this film, which ultimately depicts LaMotta as little more than a not especially intelligent, violent pugilist. The profane dialog is anything but memorable and the people who surround LaMotta are little more than ciphers. The film is brutal and often hard to watch, more so because of its pretense rather than brutality. Scorsese films the whole thing in stark black and white and choreographs some of the boxing footage with mournful classical music. All of these touches seem to indicate a serious subject of near biblical importance  but that subject most definitely is not seen on screen in the guise of LaMotta. Joe Pesci pretty much contributes his stock Joe Pesci performance as Jake's brother. The film's biggest attempt at humor comes at the expense of Cathy Moriarty, a whiskey-voiced actress who resembles a 30-year-old vamp but who the film initially tries to pass off as a virginal 15-year-old(!). To her credit, she gets past that initial hurdle and makes Vickie LaMotta the only sympathetic character in the film. Raging Bull is by no stretch a bad film, but it is a criminally overrated one done in by ostentatious pretentiousness and an unsympathetic central character who (no matter how amazing the actor's physical transformation) is nothing more than a one-dimensional thug.",ostentatiously pretentious with one dimensional central character,certainly contender most overrated film ever made i like some martin scorseses work but i have never understood near hysterical reactions elicited by critics his die hard fans over his contributions cinema which much like steven spielberg range wonderful embarrassing them every scorsese film is brilliant however despite reassurances various critical associations hero worshipping fans all too willing declare this greatest film made last 30 years most viewers may well wonder what all hoopla is about film is biography boxer jake lamotta documents his volatile tempestuous nature both boxing ring his personal life there is no doubt that robert deniro hurls himself heart soul into this role but much accolades heaped onto his work center arduous physical labors he endured get himself into fighting shape lamotta at his prime then make himself fat depict lamotta having gone seed one must admire his dedication but it was hardly first time actor had gone such efforts people quickly forget weight gains actresses such as elizabeth taylor whos afraid virginia woolf or lynn redgrave georgy girl more than decade prior deniro raging bull ironically other than physical there is nothing recommend lamotta as character around whom movie should be centered he greets every obstacle his life either person or event by trying batter it into bloody submission there is no range him he is most certainly not charismatic person i certainly would not wish spend more than few moments his presence much less duration this film which ultimately depicts lamotta as little more than not especially intelligent violent pugilist profane dialog is anything but memorable people who surround lamotta are little more than ciphers film is brutal often hard watch more so because its pretense rather than brutality scorsese films whole thing stark black white choreographs some boxing footage with mournful classical music all these touches seem indicate serious subject near biblical importance but that subject most definitely is not seen screen guise lamotta joe pesci pretty much contributes his stock joe pesci performance as jakes brother films biggest attempt at humor comes at expense cathy moriarty whiskey voiced actress who resembles 30 year old vamp but who film initially tries pass off as virginal 15 year old her credit she gets past that initial hurdle makes vickie lamotta only sympathetic character film raging bull is by no stretch bad film but it is criminally overrated one done by ostentatious pretentiousness unsympathetic central character who no matter how amazing actors physical transformation is nothing more than one dimensional thug,0.5091859716859717,0.04058880308880308,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,Like a train wreck you just can't stop watching...,"Wow. This is an incredibly unpleasant film about a particularly unpleasant man. However, as the main character (boxer Jake LaMotta) is SO unpleasant and awful, the film is hard to stop watching--like some sort of train wreck that lasts 129 minutes! Now I am NOT saying the film isn't well made--it's very well crafted and there a lot of things to admire about it....but the characters (particularly Jake) are so awful that you just marvel at them.The film is the life story of Jake LaMotta and it covers from his early days as a professional boxer in 1941 through his early post-boxing years. However, there are many things that make it quite different from films like ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" and ""Rocky""--and not just the bubbling hostility of Jake outside the ring. In addition, those around him are incredibly harsh and unpleasant. It's funny, but the mobsters around him are NICER than the LaMottas (Jake and his almost as vicious brother, Joey) and you see them as the gentlemen in the film! Also, unlike these other boxer films, this one shows the brutality in the ring to a degree only approximated in one other film--Kirk Douglas' ""Champion""--though ""Raging Bull"" manages to go a few steps further in the brutality department. A few of the boxing scenes, in particular, are amazingly graphic--with broken noses and squirting blood galore. Now I know I might sound crazy saying this, but this Martin Scorsese film is probably one of the best indictments AGAINST boxing because it IS so bloody and brutal. I'd place it among films like ""Requium For a Heavyweight"" and ""The Harder They Fall"" as the best in anti-boxing films! So let's talk about the technical aspects of the film. When it comes to the boxing sequences, this is an amazing film. As I said above, the brutality of the scenes is stomach-turning. And, instead of quickly filming the matches, the director chose to choreograph them so maximize the emotional impact--with loud thuds, great lighting and amazing effects to simulate the gallons of blood spilled in the fights. My only complaint about the fights is that the boxers simply threw too many punches. No boxing match (even the lightweight ones) has THAT much punching in rapid succession. If they did, they'd never go more than three rounds, as the fighters would collapse from exhaustion! But, this exaggeration did make the scenes more intense, so I saw it as a case of artistic license. As for making the film in black & white, I think this also worked well.The acting was pretty amazing. A lot has been said about Robert DiNero's commitment to the role--and how he deliberately ballooned up 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta. In addition, the intense physical training he underwent to become the character was amazing. You have to admire his willingness to give his all for the part! When I looked for pictures of Jake, Joey and Mrs. LaMotta, I was also amazed that the actors (DiNero, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty) really did look a lot like the actual people they portrayed--a nice touch. Overall, an exceptional film in most every way, though it's NOT a film for everyone. The unpleasantness of the film make it something that many simply don't want to endure--and I can certainly understand this--it is bloody and vicious throughout.",like train wreck you just cant stop watching,wow this is incredibly unpleasant film about particularly unpleasant man however as main character boxer jake lamotta is so unpleasant awful film is hard stop watching like some sort train wreck that lasts 129 minutes now i am not saying film isnt well made its very well crafted there lot things admire about it but characters particularly jake are so awful that you just marvel at them film is life story jake lamotta it covers his early days as professional boxer 1941 through his early post boxing years however there are many things that make it quite different films like somebody up there likes me rocky not just bubbling hostility jake outside ring addition those around him are incredibly harsh unpleasant its funny but mobsters around him are nicer than lamottas jake his almost as vicious brother joey you see them as gentlemen film also unlike these other boxer films this one shows brutality ring degree only approximated one other film kirk douglas champion though raging bull manages go few steps further brutality department few boxing scenes particular are amazingly graphic with broken noses squirting blood galore now i know i might sound crazy saying this but this martin scorsese film is probably one best indictments against boxing because it is so bloody brutal id place it among films like requium heavyweight harder they fall as best anti boxing films so lets talk about technical aspects film when it comes boxing sequences this is amazing film as i said above brutality scenes is stomach turning instead quickly filming matches director chose choreograph them so maximize emotional impact with loud thuds great lighting amazing effects simulate gallons blood spilled fights my only complaint about fights is that boxers simply threw too many punches no boxing match even lightweight ones has that much punching rapid succession if they did theyd never go more than three rounds as fighters would collapse exhaustion but this exaggeration did make scenes more intense so i saw it as case artistic license as making film black white i think this also worked well acting was pretty amazing lot has been said about robert dineros commitment role how he deliberately ballooned up 60 pounds play retired lamotta addition intense physical training he underwent become character was amazing you have admire his willingness give his all part when i looked pictures jake joey mrs lamotta i was also amazed that actors dinero joe pesci cathy moriarty really did look lot like actual people they portrayed nice touch overall exceptional film most every way though its not film everyone unpleasantness film make it something that many simply dont want endure i can certainly understand this it is bloody vicious throughout,0.5653273809523809,0.020337301587301612,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,Another Scorsese masterpiece!,"Raging Bull is one of Martin Scorsese's best films and with out a doubt the best film of the 80's. It follows the career of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta as his career progresses but his emotional problems worsen.The most notable feature in Raging Bull is the colour. All but the home Video footage is shot in black and white. This was a huge risk on Scorsase's part but it defiantly pays off, the film wouldn't feel the same had it been done in colour.Throughout the entire film acting is simply impeccable. De Niro and Pesci are both stunning. The script is amazing, you really feel like you understand every character, none of their actions seem out of character no matter how outrageous they may be.Scorsese's directing is stunning. He really is a very talented director and in Raging Bull it shows. The fight scenes are famous for their brutal realism and it's easy to see why. He puts you right in the ring with the fighters and you cant help but admire their technical brilliance. However, the most stunning aspect of all is Thelma Schoonmaker's editing. Its some of the best editing I've ever seen especially during the fight scenes where it's positively breathtaking.No matter what happens you always find yourself sympathising with La Motta, even during his most outrageous moments. Not only is Raging Bull the greatest film to come out of the 80's but is one of the greatest this century that's highly underrated and defiantly worth owning.10 out of 10",another scorsese masterpiece,raging bull is one martin scorseses best films with out doubt best film 80s it follows career middleweight boxing champion jake lamotta as his career progresses but his emotional problems worsen most notable feature raging bull is colour all but home video footage is shot black white this was huge risk scorsases part but it defiantly pays off film wouldnt feel same had it been done colour throughout entire film acting is simply impeccable de niro pesci are both stunning script is amazing you really feel like you understand every character none their actions seem out character no matter how outrageous they may be scorseses directing is stunning he really is very talented director raging bull it shows fight scenes are famous their brutal realism its easy see why he puts you right ring with fighters you cant help but admire their technical brilliance however most stunning aspect all is thelma schoonmakers editing its some best editing ive ever seen especially during fight scenes where its positively breathtaking no matter what happens you always find yourself sympathising with la motta even during his most outrageous moments not only is raging bull greatest film come out 80s but is one greatest this century thats highly underrated defiantly worth owning 10 out 10,0.6454965986394559,0.31421088435374156,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
5.0,Don't believe the hype,"I don't write reviews on IMDb very often, but this particular movie baffles me. How is this in the IMDb Top 250? The only positives I have are that it's well shot and does an excellent job portraying what it's like to be in the same room as a group of people with nothing good to say about each other. The acting is solid all around but nothing groundbreaking. Joe Pesci played Joe Pesci. I didn't find Robert Deniro's performance that amazing; yes he gained 60 pounds to play the retired LaMotta, but besides a lot of yelling, nothing about this universally lauded performance stood out to me. Speaking of yelling, about 70% of the movie is comprised of angry people yelling at each other. I guess all the characters are supposed to be unhappy, but that doesn't mean they all have to be unlikable. There's no reason to care about any of the characters since we hardly get to know them. Maybe the fact that a more relatable side of the characters is never displayed is part of what the film is going for thematically, but the presentation could have been a lot better. For these reasons, I found Raging Bull mostly boring and somewhat exhausting to sit through. I've at least liked every other Martin Scorsese film I've seen, but this one left me unsatisfied and with a sour taste in my mouth.",dont believe hype,i dont write reviews imdb very often but this particular movie baffles me how is this imdb top 250 only positives i have are that its well shot does excellent job portraying what its like be same room as group people with nothing good say about each other acting is solid all around but nothing groundbreaking joe pesci played joe pesci i didnt find robert deniros performance that amazing yes he gained 60 pounds play retired lamotta but besides lot yelling nothing about this universally lauded performance stood out me speaking yelling about 70 movie is comprised angry people yelling at each other i guess all characters are supposed be unhappy but that doesnt mean they all have be unlikable theres no reason care about any characters since we hardly get know them maybe fact that more relatable side characters is never displayed is part what film is going thematically but presentation could have been lot better these reasons i found raging bull mostly boring somewhat exhausting sit through ive at least liked every other martin scorsese film ive seen but this one left me unsatisfied with sour taste my mouth,0.4966346153846154,0.03221153846153844,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,China Shop,"Spoilers herein.I'll be right up front. I admit Scorsese's skill but just don't like his films and certainly don't see any art in them.That's because I disagree with him on what cinematic storytelling is all about. For him, characters are everything, which is why he needs sledgehammers as actors, and spikes (gangsters, etc) as the roles. Then he arranges for them to explode or simmer or steam, or explode again.Every element of the eye is subservient to the character. He (always he except for his experiment with poor Alice) pulls the camera around. We as bound audience follow. It is all about involuntary submission to manufactured charisma. I don't like this style of storytelling. It ignores the greatest power of the camera's eye: to allow the audience to move in and out of spaces: personal spaces, narrative spaces, time folding, sometimes God, sometimes his victim. There's freedom and imagination when the eye is freed, and this is the real power of the filmmaker.But with Martin, he ignores this power: the camera is bound. We are the weak sidekick, forced into respect. All the competence (here the editing is superb) is turned to an end which ruins the experience. Scorsese knows this, in fact at this point in his life he was feeling it, and that is why we get what we do. A camera that forces respect.But alone of his films (I am re-seeing them all), this has a sweet pleasure. In the midst of the obligatory scene where DeNiro takes to himself in the mirror, we get a wonderful reference to Brando. This frames the film and explicitly acknowledges that most films (except those of the real geniuses) are about other films, not life. `Bull' stands on `Waterfront's' structure.And DeNiro stands on Brando's shoulders. How brave to mouth the lines. Brando was intense, but that was not his innovation, it was an ability to project two performances simultaneously. Here DeNiro tries to equal or best that by playing three characters: himself besting Brando, his character equalling Brando's, and Brando wrestling with his character (which we see in `Waterfront' as a man wrestling with his inner self).Watch how DeNiro tries. How he pushes too hard (something we can now call the Pacino/Cage error), how he loses control and knows it. Scorsese knows it too, and it speaks highly of them both to put DeNiro's `not world class' broken actor as representative of the broken `not world class' boxer. I appreciate that honesty. It makes this my favorite film of his (Scorsese).",china shop,spoilers herein ill be right up front i admit scorseses skill but just dont like his films certainly dont see any art them thats because i disagree with him what cinematic storytelling is all about him characters are everything which is why he needs sledgehammers as actors spikes gangsters etc as roles then he arranges them explode or simmer or steam or explode again every element eye is subservient character he always he except his experiment with poor alice pulls camera around we as bound audience follow it is all about involuntary submission manufactured charisma i dont like this style storytelling it ignores greatest power cameras eye allow audience move out spaces personal spaces narrative spaces time folding sometimes god sometimes his victim theres freedom imagination when eye is freed this is real power filmmaker but with martin he ignores this power camera is bound we are weak sidekick forced into respect all competence here editing is superb is turned end which ruins experience scorsese knows this fact at this point his life he was feeling it that is why we get what we do camera that forces respect but alone his films i am re seeing them all this has sweet pleasure midst obligatory scene where deniro takes himself mirror we get wonderful reference brando this frames film explicitly acknowledges that most films except those real geniuses are about other films not life bull stands waterfronts structure deniro stands brandos shoulders how brave mouth lines brando was intense but that was not his innovation it was ability project two performances simultaneously here deniro tries equal or best that by playing three characters himself besting brando his character equalling brandos brando wrestling with his character which we see waterfront as man wrestling with his inner self watch how deniro tries how he pushes too hard something we can now call pacino cage error how he loses control knows it scorsese knows it too it speaks highly them both put deniros not world class broken actor as representative broken not world class boxer i appreciate that honesty it makes this my favorite film his scorsese,0.5130798771121352,0.12559139784946238,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,A Great Film But ...,"Scorsese's RAGING BULL is rightly up held as a wonderful piece of film making . Robert DeNiro takes method acting to new heights . Yeah we've all heard the story about how he built his physique up by going to the gym and then after these scenes were filmed he did nothing but sit on his butt and gorge himself on junk food so he'd physically resemble the bloated and overweight Jake La Motta in later life , but this story is worth repeating again and again . Look at the scene where DeNiro uses the public phone box , he raises his arm to speak into the receiver and you can subtly see DeNiro's pot belly bulging out from his shirt . All the performances are good but DeNiro totally dominates the movie It's not just an acting masterclass we see . RAGING BULL is very much an art house movie brought to mainstream cinema by Scorsese . Look at the scenes inside the ring . I doubt if a boxer would recognise these scenes as being realistic as such since everything about them are highly stylised . It's not a film that shows the gritty realism of being inside a boxing ring where two modern day gladiators fight one another , it's a film that paints the pain , poetry and ugly beauty of boxing . On a technical front this is absolutely superlative where editing , cinematography , make up and sound mix all come together "" Hey Theo , if it's such a great movie why have you only given this eight out of ten ? "" True it's a great movie and you didn't need me to point that out and when I say it's a very honest movie this is not meant as a criticism , in fact I do wish more movies would be far more honest when it comes to biopics , it's just that the problem with RAGING BULL can be summed up with the scene that starts with Jake and his brother banging on the TV set wondering why they can't get a picture . It's a scene that's wonderfully structured and built upon by the screenwriters , it's absolutely brilliantly acted by all the cast and superbly directed by Scorsese. It's just that it culminates with some extreme domestic violence and finishes with a haunting , nay heartbreaking scene of two children standing there as members of their family are brutally assaulted by La Motta . Don't be confused by what I'm saying , I don't want want biopics to be revisionist sycophants charters , it's just that for a movie to work perfectly the main protagonist must achieve some sort of empathetic connection with the audience and this is where RAGING BULL fails somewhat",great film but,scorseses raging bull is rightly up held as wonderful piece film making robert deniro takes method acting new heights yeah weve all heard story about how he built his physique up by going gym then after these scenes were filmed he did nothing but sit his butt gorge himself junk food so hed physically resemble bloated overweight jake la motta later life but this story is worth repeating again again look at scene where deniro uses public phone box he raises his arm speak into receiver you can subtly see deniros pot belly bulging out his shirt all performances are good but deniro totally dominates movie its not just acting masterclass we see raging bull is very much art house movie brought mainstream cinema by scorsese look at scenes inside ring i doubt if boxer would recognise these scenes as being realistic as such since everything about them are highly stylised its not film that shows gritty realism being inside boxing ring where two modern day gladiators fight one another its film that paints pain poetry ugly beauty boxing technical front this is absolutely superlative where editing cinematography make up sound mix all come together hey theo if its such great movie why have you only given this eight out ten true its great movie you didnt need me point that out when i say its very honest movie this is not meant as criticism fact i do wish more movies would be far more honest when it comes biopics its just that problem with raging bull can be summed up with scene that starts with jake his brother banging tv set wondering why they cant get picture its scene thats wonderfully structured built upon by screenwriters its absolutely brilliantly acted by all cast superbly directed by scorsese its just that it culminates with some extreme domestic violence finishes with haunting nay heartbreaking scene two children standing there as members their family are brutally assaulted by la motta dont be confused by what im saying i dont want want biopics be revisionist sycophants charters its just that movie work perfectly main protagonist must achieve some sort empathetic connection with audience this is where raging bull fails somewhat,0.5573593073593074,0.21330413772274237,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.44}"
10.0,Brutal and Honest,"Since John Wayne and John Ford stopped making films, the greatest director/actor combination of the last 35 years is in my mind Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro. In Raging Bull these two guys are within their element. An added dimension to Scorsese's direction and DeNiro's portrayal is that these are the people they know and grew up with. Raging Bull invokes a world of the past that isn't always pleasant, but is brutal and honest.Jake LaMotta as middleweight champion of the world 1949-1951 may have had the hardest chin in boxing. He was a good puncher, but he had a marvelous ability to not only take a punch, but roll with it so it did less damage than thought. He fooled many an opponent like that and set them up for the kill.Large parts of the boxing establishment was controlled by organized crime back in his days, the fathers of the people you'd later see DeNiro play in Goodfellas. You had to play ball with them or you went nowhere in the fight game. Jake compromised himself by agreeing to throw a fight to someone named Billy Fox in order to get a title shot at the middleweight crown. It seared his very soul in doing that.One thing that wasn't covered in Raging Bull was the drama behind the title fight itself with Marcel Cerdan the man who LaMotta took the crown from. Cerdan was a national French hero, resistance fighter, lover of Edith Piaf and possessor of a murderous punch who had never been knocked out and only had sustained three losses in his career, two by disqualification. He was quite a brawler himself. Cerdan broke his elbow in the first round and for 10 rounds literally held LaMotta off with one hand. When he failed to answer the bell for the 11th round, LaMotta got the title on a TKO. He was immediately promised a rematch and was on his way to the USA for that rematch when he was killed in a plane crash in the Azores. His death set off a national period of mourning in France.LaMotta later admitted throwing the Fox fight to Congressional investigators and that with the win over the injured Cerdan cast a pall on his career and reputation. Sad because it was something he couldn't help. Jake the Bronx Bull certainly did have reason to rage. DeNiro is something special. Watching this film you really think you are peeking into a heavenly newsreel highlights and lowlights of the life and career of Jake LaMotta. This film should be seen back to back with Somebody Up There Likes Me, the Rocky Graziano story that Paul Newman brought to the screen. Covers roughly the same era with the same quality. Joe Pesci as DeNiro's manager/brother and Frank Vincent as the neighborhood wise guy would work together again and well with DeNiro and Scorsese. Cathy Moriarty gets her first notice as Jake's second wife Vicky who became a celebrity in her own right after Jake's boxing career was over.Raging Bull is one of the finest boxing films ever done by a master director assembling a perfect cast to tell the tale of a bygone era.",brutal honest,since john wayne john ford stopped making films greatest director actor combination last 35 years is my mind martin scorsese robert deniro raging bull these two guys are within their element added dimension scorseses direction deniros portrayal is that these are people they know grew up with raging bull invokes world past that isnt always pleasant but is brutal honest jake lamotta as middleweight champion world 1949 1951 may have had hardest chin boxing he was good puncher but he had marvelous ability not only take punch but roll with it so it did less damage than thought he fooled many opponent like that set them up kill large parts boxing establishment was controlled by organized crime back his days fathers people youd later see deniro play goodfellas you had play ball with them or you went nowhere fight game jake compromised himself by agreeing throw fight someone named billy fox order get title shot at middleweight crown it seared his very soul doing that one thing that wasnt covered raging bull was drama behind title fight itself with marcel cerdan man who lamotta took crown cerdan was national french hero resistance fighter lover edith piaf possessor murderous punch who had never been knocked out only had sustained three losses his career two by disqualification he was quite brawler himself cerdan broke his elbow first round 10 rounds literally held lamotta off with one hand when he failed answer bell 11th round lamotta got title tko he was immediately promised rematch was his way usa that rematch when he was killed plane crash azores his death set off national period mourning france lamotta later admitted throwing fox fight congressional investigators that with win over injured cerdan cast pall his career reputation sad because it was something he couldnt help jake bronx bull certainly did have reason rage deniro is something special watching this film you really think you are peeking into heavenly newsreel highlights lowlights life career jake lamotta this film should be seen back back with somebody up there likes me rocky graziano story that paul newman brought screen covers roughly same era with same quality joe pesci as deniros manager brother frank vincent as neighborhood wise guy would work together again well with deniro scorsese cathy moriarty gets her first notice as jakes second wife vicky who became celebrity her own right after jakes boxing career was over raging bull is one finest boxing films ever done by master director assembling perfect cast tell tale bygone era,0.48270975056689336,0.13424036281179139,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,"one of the most powerful movies, ever!","From the story of a one time middle weight champion of the world and his apparent necessity for internal conflict and self destruction, America's greatest director in the history of cinema has carved a masterpiece of a feature, teaming up with the greatest actor of his generation in order to establish what will no doubt go down in history as one of the most powerful films of all time. ""Raging Bull"", directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert deNiro in the brilliant performance that ensured him a well deserved Academy Award, is a raw feature film that will have you stunned at its conclusion and leave you reeling in your theatre, couch or bed until the final credit has finished rolling off the screen.The film, adapted from another source, revolves around the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta (deNiro), an ambitious middle weight fighter who has struggled for years along with his manager brother (an unforgettable Joe Pesci) to get a shot at the title for the middle weight champion of the world. Frustrated with himself and the life that he's had to lead, LaMotta presents the complex mind of a self destructive man who's inhumanity and self-destructive nature push him away from all the people in the world that love him and ultimately transform him from a prize fighter into an overweight sleaze with nothing but the clothes on his back. From the flawless and gripping boxing scenes to the raw yet accurate portrayal of his abusive habits towards both his brother and wife, ""Raging Bull"" succeeds on absolutely every level.DeNiro's performance in the film is unquestionably his finest piece of work in his own personal career, if not throughout the history of cinema altogether. Completely believable as a boxer, he furthermore went on a diet to put on 60 pounds for his scenes situated in the latter half of the film when he has hit rock bottom which is testament to both his dedication and his unparalleled skill of establishing a believable character. Joe Pesci is absolutely brilliant as his portrayal of Jake's brother, Joey LaMotta, and considering the fact that was one of his first feature films in the spotlight, he completely delivers a character who loves his brother unquestionably but who also has internal struggles regarding his own nature and his methods of dealing with his brother. I fell in love with Joe Pesci due to his performance here, and he is clearly one of the more talented and gifted actors within Hollywood.Scorsese is also in top form, and you can feel his presence, his brilliance and his uncompromising dedication to showing you the real life and times of Jake LaMotta in every single piece of footage presented to you on the screen. Martin Scorsese illustrates the reason why he is considered by many to be cinema's greatest film director of all time as he takes you on a journey of Jake LaMotta's personal and public existence. Scorsese doesn't leave anything out, and his brilliance obviously lies within the fact that he can illustrate everything about a character in the simplest of scenes to make you empathise but simultaneously make you comprehend the various fundamental layers of such a despicable character in cinema history. And on top of that, he can make you like the character and hate the character at the exact same time - a brilliance unprecedented throughout Hollywood and surely testament to Scorsese's superiority to directors such as Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood who, despite having tremendous talent, cannot realistically present characters to the extent that Scorsese can.Further supporting cast members, Cathy Moriarty and Frank Vincent deliver completely credible characters with Moriarty well deserving of her Oscar Nomination for her performance as Vickie. The editing was completely flawless and top notch throughout the entire feature with Scorsese's other partner - Thelma Schoonmaker - bringing Scorsese's incredible vision to life once more without a single complaint in the world. Brilliant cinematography ensured a visually compelling piece of work, exemplified further by an Oscar Nod towards this element of the picture also.All in all, this is arguably the finest achievement from the Scorsese-DeNiro partnership, and it delivers everything that you would predict from our beloved Martin Scorsese. Love, deceit, hate, an underlying theme of violence, some of the best acting ever put on film as well as some of the most brutal and compelling sequences of boxing you'll ever see: all are shown with flamboyance and an honest brutality that we've come to accept as the trademark of Martin Scorsese in this poignant tale of one man's annihilation of self. And who is the only director who could realistically bring this to life? We all know the answer.Well done, Mr Scorsese. Regardless of what the pretentious fools responsible for the decisions that the Academy makes, the people are fully aware of who the best director in town is.""Raging Bull"" is flawless and perfect. 10 out of 10, all the way.",one most powerful movies ever,story one time middle weight champion world his apparent necessity internal conflict self destruction americas greatest director history cinema has carved masterpiece feature teaming up with greatest actor his generation order establish what will no doubt go down history as one most powerful films all time raging bull directed by martin scorsese starring robert deniro brilliant performance that ensured him well deserved academy award is raw feature film that will have you stunned at its conclusion leave you reeling your theatre couch or bed until final credit has finished rolling off screen film adapted another source revolves around rise fall jake lamotta deniro ambitious middle weight fighter who has struggled years along with his manager brother unforgettable joe pesci get shot at title middle weight champion world frustrated with himself life that hes had lead lamotta presents complex mind self destructive man whos inhumanity self destructive nature push him away all people world that love him ultimately transform him prize fighter into overweight sleaze with nothing but clothes his back flawless gripping boxing scenes raw yet accurate portrayal his abusive habits towards both his brother wife raging bull succeeds absolutely every level deniros performance film is unquestionably his finest piece work his own personal career if not throughout history cinema altogether completely believable as boxer he furthermore went diet put 60 pounds his scenes situated latter half film when he has hit rock bottom which is testament both his dedication his unparalleled skill establishing believable character joe pesci is absolutely brilliant as his portrayal jakes brother joey lamotta considering fact that was one his first feature films spotlight he completely delivers character who loves his brother unquestionably but who also has internal struggles regarding his own nature his methods dealing with his brother i fell love with joe pesci due his performance here he is clearly one more talented gifted actors within hollywood scorsese is also top form you can feel his presence his brilliance his uncompromising dedication showing you real life times jake lamotta every single piece footage presented you screen martin scorsese illustrates reason why he is considered by many be cinemas greatest film director all time as he takes you journey jake lamottas personal public existence scorsese doesnt leave anything out his brilliance obviously lies within fact that he can illustrate everything about character simplest scenes make you empathise but simultaneously make you comprehend various fundamental layers such despicable character cinema history top that he can make you like character hate character at exact same time brilliance unprecedented throughout hollywood surely testament scorseses superiority directors such as steven spielberg clint eastwood who despite having tremendous talent cannot realistically present characters extent that scorsese can further supporting cast members cathy moriarty frank vincent deliver completely credible characters with moriarty well deserving her oscar nomination her performance as vickie editing was completely flawless top notch throughout entire feature with scorseses other partner thelma schoonmaker bringing scorseses incredible vision life once more without single complaint world brilliant cinematography ensured visually compelling piece work exemplified further by oscar nod towards this element picture also all all this is arguably finest achievement scorsese deniro partnership it delivers everything that you would predict our beloved martin scorsese love deceit hate underlying theme violence some best acting ever put film as well as some most brutal compelling sequences boxing youll ever see all are shown with flamboyance honest brutality that weve come accept as trademark martin scorsese this poignant tale one mans annihilation self who is only director who could realistically bring this life we all know answer well done mr scorsese regardless what pretentious fools responsible decisions that academy makes people are fully aware who best director town is raging bull is flawless perfect 10 out 10 all way,0.5664567292118312,0.2549154643542398,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.4}"
,"The Story of a Brother, Husband, Boxer, Comedian and Human Being","I've been wanting to watch 'Raging Bull' for a long time. Finally 'got the collector's edition DVD and watched it. Now I can see why people call it one of the best movies. Yes, I absolutely loved it but it's one of those films that makes you think (long after the credits have rolled) and when you think about it you understand it better and appreciate it more.The screenplay is tight, concise and balanced. There's been some very skillfully wonderful editing. Nothing is loud or over the top or irrelevant to the main plot. Cinematography deserves mention as the camera movements are fantastic and very effective. Lighting and sound effect deserve mention too (as its a black and white movie and must have been one of the hardest tasks to achieve, while the sound is very well balanced).'Raging Bull' tells the story of the infamous Jake La Motta (played excellently by the one and only Robert de Niro). Its classification as a boxing movie is totally erroneous because the film is just too much more for it to be labelled as such. And by giving such a label one would be ignoring it's brilliance. Yes, boxing is a part of Jake's life (it's what he does for a living) and that's how it's portrayed. It hardly had any significant resemblance to other Boxing movies like Rocky etc. The film is more about his relationship with his brother and wife, his ups and down in his professional life ie, his rise and fall to and from fame.'Raging Bull' belongs to Robert de Niro but Joe Pesci (as the brother and manager) and Cathy Moriarty (as the wife) are equally effective in their smaller roles. The relationship between the brothers was very moving and one can't help but feel bad for La Motta when he tries to reach out to his brother in one of the final scenes. Moriarty gives a very subtle performance of the tolerant wife.Even though we see La Motta as this mean hateful jerk, we see his vulnerable side and feel sympathy. Maybe that's also why his wife Vickie stood by him through all these years. It's also interesting to see that he wasn't physically abusive to his previous wife but towards Vickie he was quite violent. His brother too tries to protect him and his family (although he has his share of flaws) but in the end when La Motta's paranoia takes over things go from sour to very bad. We just see how human these characters are and at times we hate them, we like them and we feel sorry for them.Martin Scorsese deserves special mention for putting this beautiful piece of work on the glass canvas. He obviously has a very compelling way to tell the story. It is without any doubt one of his finest works and it has stood the test of time (one of the greatest achievements for a director I suppose).",story brother husband boxer comedian human being,ive been wanting watch raging bull long time finally got collectors edition dvd watched it now i can see why people call it one best movies yes i absolutely loved it but its one those films that makes you think long after credits have rolled when you think about it you understand it better appreciate it more screenplay is tight concise balanced theres been some very skillfully wonderful editing nothing is loud or over top or irrelevant main plot cinematography deserves mention as camera movements are fantastic very effective lighting sound effect deserve mention too as its black white movie must have been one hardest tasks achieve while sound is very well balanced raging bull tells story infamous jake la motta played excellently by one only robert de niro its classification as boxing movie is totally erroneous because film is just too much more it be labelled as such by giving such label one would be ignoring its brilliance yes boxing is part jakes life its what he does living thats how its portrayed it hardly had any significant resemblance other boxing movies like rocky etc film is more about his relationship with his brother wife his ups down his professional life ie his rise fall fame raging bull belongs robert de niro but joe pesci as brother manager cathy moriarty as wife are equally effective their smaller roles relationship between brothers was very moving one cant help but feel bad la motta when he tries reach out his brother one final scenes moriarty gives very subtle performance tolerant wife even though we see la motta as this mean hateful jerk we see his vulnerable side feel sympathy maybe thats also why his wife vickie stood by him through all these years its also interesting see that he wasnt physically abusive his previous wife but towards vickie he was quite violent his brother too tries protect him his family although he has his share flaws but end when la mottas paranoia takes over things go sour very bad we just see how human these characters are at times we hate them we like them we feel sorry them martin scorsese deserves special mention putting this beautiful piece work glass canvas he obviously has very compelling way tell story it is without any doubt one his finest works it has stood test time one greatest achievements director i suppose,0.5760787037037038,0.08881415343915341,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"

,"On jealousy, the opening credit, boxing scenes, and other things","SpoilersWatching Raging Bull nearly a quarter of a century after De Niro won his Oscar cannot be the same experience as watching the movie when it was freshly made. The interesting thing is that regardless of when you watch a movie, there would often be another one that it would make you recall. In my case, it's Sylvia which I saw very recently. The link is the emotion called jealousy. Manifested in two real-life characters of the opposite sex, jealousy just jump out of the screen at you in both movies, although strangely, it isn't the main subject matter of either. Strange it may seems, jealousy serving as an immediate link between two human beings that could not have been more different: Jake La Motta and Sylvia Plath,. In the opening credit, against the background music of Ave Maria (Bach-Gounod's version, I think, but could well be wrong), we see in slow motion a blurred figure (presumably De Niro) in a hood, at a distance, practising by himself on the far left side of the screen, in a boxing ring. Regardless of what it is saying, or not saying, the combination of the mystic visual image and serene music produces an uncanningly haunting effect.Moving right alongon the boxing scenes. Someone once said that boxing is the purest form of head-to-head confrontation/combat. The movie industry is prolific with good boxing scenes. (Even Elvis Presley in Kid Galahad is not that bad). The unique thing about the boxing scenes in Raging Bull (and there are so many of them) is that they are closest to documentary footage than what you'll see anywhere else. In Raging Bull, there is little dramatic consequence to them. As are result, they can be filmed in the purest form. Many have commented that these boxing sequences are brilliant, and maybe that's why.Going to other aspects of the film, I enjoy particularly watching the courtship sequence. The parties involved are not exactly intellectual giants, and both De Niro and Cathy Moriarty portrayed there characters beautifully and, as far as I can surmise, realistically. Coming with the slightly minimalised acting is a sweet innocent that is uncharacteristic of the film.On De Niro's Oscar calibre performance enough has been said over the last quarter-century, including how he went off for two months to put on that extra 50 pounds before they resumed shooting to complete the last part of the film. Looking at Charlize Theron today, we see that something never changes: the winning combination of talent and professional dedication.",jealousy opening credit boxing scenes other things,spoilerswatching raging bull nearly quarter century after de niro won his oscar cannot be same experience as watching movie when it was freshly made interesting thing is that regardless when you watch movie there would often be another one that it would make you recall my case its sylvia which i saw very recently link is emotion called jealousy manifested two real life characters opposite sex jealousy just jump out screen at you both movies although strangely it isnt main subject matter either strange it may seems jealousy serving as immediate link between two human beings that could not have been more different jake la motta sylvia plath opening credit against background music ave maria bach gounods version i think but could well be wrong we see slow motion blurred figure presumably de niro hood at distance practising by himself far left side screen boxing ring regardless what it is saying or not saying combination mystic visual image serene music produces uncanningly haunting effect moving right along boxing scenes someone once said that boxing is purest form head head confrontation combat movie industry is prolific with good boxing scenes even elvis presley kid galahad is not that bad unique thing about boxing scenes raging bull there are so many them is that they are closest documentary footage than what youll see anywhere else raging bull there is little dramatic consequence them as are result they can be filmed purest form many have commented that these boxing sequences are brilliant maybe thats why going other aspects film i enjoy particularly watching courtship sequence parties involved are not exactly intellectual giants both de niro cathy moriarty portrayed there characters beautifully as far as i can surmise realistically coming with slightly minimalised acting is sweet innocent that is uncharacteristic film de niros oscar calibre performance enough has been said over last quarter century including how he went off two months put that extra 50 pounds before they resumed shooting complete last part film looking at charlize theron today we see that something never changes winning combination talent professional dedication,0.4130952380952381,0.09543219461697723,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.41}"
