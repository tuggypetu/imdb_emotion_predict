9.0,The Most faulty comment on a Honest film,"Mr.Kumar.Y has mentioned things that are unfair and untrue to 'Virumandi'. Firstly, the 3 POV storytelling familiarized by Kurosowa, had been used in many films around the world and was used long back in Tamil cinema By Director S.Balachander in the Sivaji Ganesan starer 'Andha Naal'(1954). It was just a tool adapted by Kamal Hassan, to convey a story that is rustic & real.Its untrue to say Kurosawa's Roshomon had the same concept of that of Virumandi. Each had the story that was true and real to their soils and had just obvious similarities that can be between any two films.""Its a great movie but for the trumped up violence..."" ..and this too is unjust. No where is the violence been glorified or pushed in cheaply. Instead if observed in a right sense and taste all the gore is justified and raw truths.To make it straight, this one of the honest films made ever in Indian Cinema. A superior cinema that was well received with masses too.Hats off & 8.5/10",most faulty comment honest film,mr kumar y has mentioned things that are unfair untrue virumandi firstly 3 pov storytelling familiarized by kurosowa had been used many films around world was used long back tamil cinema by director s balachander sivaji ganesan starer andha naal 1954 it was just tool adapted by kamal hassan convey story that is rustic real its untrue say kurosawas roshomon had same concept that virumandi each had story that was true real their soils had just obvious similarities that can be between any two films its great movie but trumped up violence this too is unjust no where is violence been glorified or pushed cheaply instead if observed right sense taste all gore is justified raw truths make it straight this one honest films made ever indian cinema superior cinema that was well received with masses too hats off 8 5 10,0.5527793040293041,0.26024725274725274,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.25}"
10.0,a masterpiece,"Virumandi is another masterpiece from genuis kamal.The way in which the story has been told is something amazing and very rarely you can see in Indian Cinema leave alone Tamil Cinema. I was very much depressed when films like Anbe Sivam and Hey Ram failed with people but hats off to kamal for his perseverance and hardwork and never giving up attitude to stage a great comeback in Virumandi and scripted a message in Film Industry that realistic and Quality films can also do well in box office. In my opinion currently Kamal is the best in Indian film Industry when it comes to making high quality films.Look at Virumandi - the way in which story being told with flawless screen play, powerful dialogues and aesthetic direction and utilising the technology to a fullest extent. I think his mentor Balachander should be proud of his student. As an actor he has already proved that he is No 1 in the country and from film Direction point of view he is the process of taking Tamil/Indian cinema to International arena. Probably in years going forward we can witness a range of International awards being confered on this great artist.",masterpiece,virumandi is another masterpiece genuis kamal way which story has been told is something amazing very rarely you can see indian cinema leave alone tamil cinema i was very much depressed when films like anbe sivam hey ram failed with people but hats off kamal his perseverance hardwork never giving up attitude stage great comeback virumandi scripted message film industry that realistic quality films can also do well box office my opinion currently kamal is best indian film industry when it comes making high quality films look at virumandi way which story being told with flawless screen play powerful dialogues aesthetic direction utilising technology fullest extent i think his mentor balachander should be proud his student as actor he has already proved that he is no 1 country film direction point view he is process taking tamil indian cinema international arena probably years going forward we can witness range international awards being confered this great artist,0.5688888888888889,0.38511111111111107,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,Class Act,"At a time when cliched tamil/indian movies are being made, one could only Kamal Hassan to come up with something innovative and striking! What is most exciting is the narrative set-up from two angles, two very different versions of the same story, a crime committed, 24 murders in a village in Tamil Nadu (kamal hassan and pasupathy). The underlying tension throughout this morbid tale is effective. In fact very difficult to make out who is good and evil, till the very end. Fantastic Characterization's. Excellent photography, background score. Direction by Kamal is first rate, with an interesting screen play. Regarding performances, pasupathy steals the show, along with Rohini. Abhirami as the main female lead is impressive. Kamal, the actor is not at his best, but makes up enough with his direction. It falls short of a great movie on account of a poor climax and excessive violence.

10.0,Literally brilliant....,"The movie is too rooted in the culture of south Tamil Nadu for it to receive universal acclaim. Non-Tamil Speakers, Urban Tamil folks might have serious difficulty understanding the language and culture depicted in the film. The movie is about a brash, honest, foolish bumpkin who is caught up in the politics of two warring villages. The rivalry between castes, which is a highlight of South Indian politics, has been etched out neatly. The jail riot scenes remind you of Natural Born Killers vaguely but the jail set, actors and dialogues fit to the T. The capital punishment angle seems a tad bit forced into the movie as the movie doesn't really have anything to do with capital punishment apart from the cameo by a former Indian Judge. That apart, Virumaandi is one of the finest movies to have made it to Indian screens.The Pros: Brilliant acting, Clever dialogues, Interesting narration, Good Music The Cons: Made for a very niche audience",literally brilliant,movie is too rooted culture south tamil nadu it receive universal acclaim non tamil speakers urban tamil folks might have serious difficulty understanding language culture depicted film movie is about brash honest foolish bumpkin who is caught up politics two warring villages rivalry between castes which is highlight south indian politics has been etched out neatly jail riot scenes remind you natural born killers vaguely but jail set actors dialogues fit t capital punishment angle seems tad bit forced into movie as movie doesnt really have anything do with capital punishment apart cameo by former indian judge that apart virumaandi is one finest movies have made it indian screens pros brilliant acting clever dialogues interesting narration good music cons made very niche audience,0.42000000000000004,0.15666666666666668,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.43}"

7.0,A Must Watch Kamal Haasan phenomena to create Indian 'Roshomon' despite lacking the punctuality in the climax.,"Virumandi (2004) : Brief Review -A Must Watch Kamal Haasan phenomena to create Indian 'Roshomon' despite lacking the punctuality in the climax. Ok, so the first question is, have you seen Akira Kurosawa's Japanese Cult 'Roshomon' (1950)..? Or do you know what does 'Roshomon Effect' means? Apparently, it doesn't really matter but to understand it technically, you should know the stuff. If have seen Roshomon (1950) then it's easy for you to notice the loopes in the climax portion of Virumandi, and if you haven't then it's not really a big deal. Virumandi is a story of a temperamental farmer who gets embroiled in a bloody clan feud in a southern Tamil Nadu village. The film begins with a monologue of real footage which describe that Death Sentence is nothing but just a 'Judicially approved murder'. This gets you on rolling and then for next hour it's just a time pass film. And then after an hour, the second side of the same story arrives and stuns you. This is the best part of the film when you see the same story, same footages from different point of view and that's my friends is called 'Roshomon Effect'. Even Kurosawa's version has the same storytelling but that film shows you the same story from 3 point of views whereas Virumandi shows you only 2 perspectives. The major loss of film appears in the last 15 minutes when it loses practicality of the story and becomes a regular mass chaos. Roshomon had a terrific climax which fulfills its thoughtfulness while Virumandi drags a little while proving the point. Nevertheless, it is still a brilliant film from all aspects. It's a Kamal Haasan show all over, he's fantastic as an actor and as a director too. Abhirami and Pasupathy also showcases their good acting skills in brilliantly written characters. Overall, it's a great attempt and very much worthy too. It is just that, if you have seen Roshomon you'll find it slightly below the belt.RATING - 7.5/10*#samthebestest.",must watch kamal haasan phenomena create indian roshomon despite lacking punctuality climax,virumandi 2004 brief review must watch kamal haasan phenomena create indian roshomon despite lacking punctuality climax ok so first question is have you seen akira kurosawas japanese cult roshomon 1950 or do you know what does roshomon effect means apparently it doesnt really matter but understand it technically you should know stuff if have seen roshomon 1950 then its easy you notice loopes climax portion virumandi if you havent then its not really big deal virumandi is story temperamental farmer who gets embroiled bloody clan feud southern tamil nadu village film begins with monologue real footage which describe that death sentence is nothing but just judicially approved murder this gets you rolling then next hour its just time pass film then after hour second side same story arrives stuns you this is best part film when you see same story same footages different point view thats my friends is called roshomon effect even kurosawas version has same storytelling but that film shows you same story 3 point views whereas virumandi shows you only 2 perspectives major loss film appears last 15 minutes when it loses practicality story becomes regular mass chaos roshomon had terrific climax which fulfills its thoughtfulness while virumandi drags little while proving point nevertheless it is still brilliant film all aspects its kamal haasan show all over hes fantastic as actor as director too abhirami pasupathy also showcases their good acting skills brilliantly written characters overall its great attempt very much worthy too it is just that if you have seen roshomon youll find it slightly below belt rating 7 5 10,0.382033957033957,0.14256756756756755,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.41, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.18}"

,"Too much violence, overaction & Innovative screenplay but spoit theme","This movie is different and off-beat. Already with the way of innovative story telling (as a flashback narrated by two different people with opposite interests) which is a very BIG plus point, the recipe is spoilt with overthinking on Kamal's (the director) part to add a ""message"" to the film. The message (to abolish capital punishment) is a disjoint, not even fit as an appendix to this movie.This is really a story of one person, and should have been left like that - no need to add universally applicable messages. After all deeds done by Kamal and his villain, even those opposing capital punishment would feel these 2 guys deserve it. It is not important though made deliberately noticeable, that the villain got only life sentence whereas Kamal got death sentence. One couldn't care less.Its like - a spoilt recipe in the end which started innovatively with a brillant screenplay, and ran well though most of the film. Also, Kamal shouldn't have acted in this film - he should have just directed it - someone like Mohanlal would have lived in this movie, with much less (just adequate) action in some scenes.
