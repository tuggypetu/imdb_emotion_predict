9,This Punjab does go heights!!,"Till date, Bollywood has mostly showcased Punjab as land of prosperity full of dancing farmers in fields and big time foodies relishing sarson DA sag & makke Di roti. Intermittently some makers did show the issue of militancy phase of 80s in films like Maachis. However, this land of green-fields has off late been trapped tight in clutches of narcotics. On such a dry topic, perhaps only some documentaries would be made/ already made. To bring this issue on silver screen with mainstream actors while balancing entertainment value and remaining uncompromising on the authenticity of subject and premises, requires a lot of research work and intelligence from director and production team. Full marks to director Abhishek Chaubey and producers Anurag Kashyap (who fought the valid legal battle with censor board) and Balaji Telefilms, for raising cinematic benchmark of film-making and bringing to notice of the nation and world, the other face of Punjab through Udta Punjab. Thanks to this movie, since its controversial phase with CBFC, there have been innumerable articles on this issue across media informing we, the people of India, about the ongoing menace in Punjab. Hope, the movie manages to wake up those in power!My analysis of various facets as below:Plot: Yes, Punjab is nose dipped in the dark world of drugs and is almost on the verge of becoming another Mexico. The movie manages to touch the right chord in terms of characterization, casting, premises and most importantly, story-line. 3 sets of stories woven around perils of drugs run in parallel only to converge before/ at climax. The movie wins as it manages to prove that drugs have gripped all classes - low/ middle/ high with equal jeopardy. While showcasing modus-operandi of this fatal trade, the film questions the irresponsible and corrupt practices of administration and politics alike. The movie is full of cuss-words which do not look out-of-place and add to the genuineness of this North-Indian region. Despite having 2 pairs, the movie is subtle yet graceful on romantic front.Cast: Shahid Kapoor has already proved his mettle in psycho- emotional roles in movies like Kaminey & Haider. As Tommy Singh, the gabru rap-star, he only raises the bar a notch higher exuding full- on madness mixed with the sensitive and remorseful side of the character. However, it is Alia Bhatt for me, who emerges as the biggest surprise, gracing the role of a Bihari migrant labourer. She literally wears the unnamed character on her sleeves, not only through diction of that perfect dialect but more through the immaculate body-language oozing terrific vulnerability, angst and strength of her character. Highway is history now; this girl will be known by Udta Punjab in future! Kareena Kapoor Khan does full justice to her comparatively shorter role as a sensible doctor while giving a glimpse of a Geet intermittently. Debutant Punjabi superstar Diljeet lives up to his name winning hearts with his sincere performance changing gears from a corrupt official to a man with a purpose. Young actor Prabhjyot Singh impresses a lot as drug- addict brother of Diljeet. Rest of the cast is as realistic as the film.Music: Generally, movies on such serious topics do not require songs. However, since this one involved a music celebrity, rap songs were inevitable while a couple of others with that touch of Punjab Di mitti are heart-warming and do not disturb the pace of the film. Amit Trivedi wins it this time too!Cinematography: The movie, as the name suggests, is based in Punjab, the real one residing in small towns and districts. Rajeev Ravi leaves no stone unturned in adding maximum realism to the canvas of the film.Flaws: Some people might find the climax a bit filmy (fictional). However, that is perhaps required to end the film on a positive note, which I definitely liked.In all, Udta Punjab is definitely going to be one of the best films of this year in terms of the production quality, content, performances and music.

8,A bold and raw film which should be applauded for its genuine attempt.,"Controversies surrounding ""Udta Punjab"" finally comes to end as the dark-thriller drama releases today with high expectation thanks to the unwanted publicity it received. As the film was on the verge of getting released, I was wondering what led CBFC (Center Board Of Film Certification) to 89 cuts. We have seen films more violent and more brutal than this. Isn't the subject of ""Udta Punjab"" required to show the true facts and figures. I must say it was a bold and raw film which should be applauded for its genuine attempt.""Udta Punjab"" is story of 4 people whose lives have been influenced by the drug menace very much evident in the North Indian state of Punjab where it becomes easy money for peddlers selling heroin and opium through the safe hands of politicians. Director Abhishek Chaubey, previously helmed the well-liked Ishqiya and not-so good Dedh Ishqiya, took a step forward and created a niche subject never been attempted on Indian cinema before. Hats off to him and definitely to the producer Anurag Kashyap for taking his stand through out the controversies surrounding the film. Now coming to the film, the opening scene caters to the subject of drugs easily being exported from neighboring county (an athlete throws a packet of heroin like a ""discus throw"") and falling into our motherland as if some UFO has landed from space. Subsequent scenes introduces the four main protagonist and each character has been defined appropriately. Till the 1st half, you will be completely kept engrossed thanks to the tight screenplay (ofcourse you will wondering why the film was censored). Second half starts with some promise but goes down the deep rabbit hole and never ever recovers from there. Too much of melodrama and unwanted editing loses the steam built by the engaging first half. The easy access to the drug factory by Diljit Dosanjh and Kareena Kapoor and sneaking out with less effort with out even getting noticed by anyone is indigestible, the human connection between Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt is far stretched and the climax fight scenes are pretty abrupt which dilutes the impact of second half.Nevertheless, the film is a brave attempt and nail-biting moments like Alia Bhatt fighting back from getting injected with drugs, her frustration venting out when she meets Shahid Kapoor after the concert and the chemistry between Diljit Dosanjh and Kareena Kapoor are some of the highlights of the film. The art direction is splendid along with creative cinematography. Background score is good. Music by Amit Trivedi is mindblowing as it further sets the mood of the film. The title track ""Udta Punjab"" and ""Da Da Dasse"" is pick of a lot. ""Udta Punjab"" is definitely a performance oriented film and that is the key element to watch the film. Among the four main protagonist, Alia Bhatt steals the show. The gifted actor is simply superb as Biharan who lands herself as a migrant ( though she is state-level hockey player). Watch out for her when she kills the guy responsible for her messy state by continuously venting out her frustration. Shahid Kapoor was just about okay in the role that required more intense which was clearly missing. Kareena Kapoor was subtle as Preet. I like her when she plays more simpler characters. Diljit Dosanjh was a good surprise. The Punjabi superstar manages to make an impression inspite of his first Bollywood film. Overall, ""Udta Punjab"" is definitely a gritty and dark film which should be appreciated for its solid facts and phenomenal performances.",bold raw film which should be applauded its genuine attempt,controversies surrounding udta punjab finally comes end as dark thriller drama releases today with high expectation thanks unwanted publicity it received as film was verge getting released i was wondering what led cbfc center board film certification 89 cuts we have seen films more violent more brutal than this isnt subject udta punjab required show true facts figures i must say it was bold raw film which should be applauded its genuine attempt udta punjab is story 4 people whose lives have been influenced by drug menace very much evident north indian state punjab where it becomes easy money peddlers selling heroin opium through safe hands politicians director abhishek chaubey previously helmed well liked ishqiya not so good dedh ishqiya took step forward created niche subject never been attempted indian cinema before hats off him definitely producer anurag kashyap taking his stand through out controversies surrounding film now coming film opening scene caters subject drugs easily being exported neighboring county athlete throws packet heroin like discus throw falling into our motherland as if some ufo has landed space subsequent scenes introduces four main protagonist each character has been defined appropriately till 1st half you will be completely kept engrossed thanks tight screenplay ofcourse you will wondering why film was censored second half starts with some promise but goes down deep rabbit hole never ever recovers there too much melodrama unwanted editing loses steam built by engaging first half easy access drug factory by diljit dosanjh kareena kapoor sneaking out with less effort with out even getting noticed by anyone is indigestible human connection between shahid kapoor alia bhatt is far stretched climax fight scenes are pretty abrupt which dilutes impact second half nevertheless film is brave attempt nail biting moments like alia bhatt fighting back getting injected with drugs her frustration venting out when she meets shahid kapoor after concert chemistry between diljit dosanjh kareena kapoor are some highlights film art direction is splendid along with creative cinematography background score is good music by amit trivedi is mindblowing as it further sets mood film title track udta punjab da da dasse is pick lot udta punjab is definitely performance oriented film that is key element watch film among four main protagonist alia bhatt steals show gifted actor is simply superb as biharan who lands herself as migrant though she is state level hockey player watch out her when she kills guy responsible her messy state by continuously venting out her frustration shahid kapoor was just about okay role that required more intense which was clearly missing kareena kapoor was subtle as preet i like her when she plays more simpler characters diljit dosanjh was good surprise punjabi superstar manages make impression inspite his first bollywood film overall udta punjab is definitely gritty dark film which should be appreciated its solid facts phenomenal performances,0.47853603499173125,0.13499157663714628,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.41}"

8,All about drug abuse and its after effects,"It's a dark, depressing, delicious drama that Abhishek Chaubey served hot at the table. The unseen, hidden face of Punjab province which is known for different reputation.When I heard all the noises about Producers of the movie and Censor board locking horns, I thought it might just be another publicity gimmick. Boy! I was wrong, it indeed left the state leaders and the administration red faced, even if this may not the picture of the entire state of Punjab.The unholy nexus between drug lords, politicians and administration is shown here.Alia Bhatt may be low on GK but high on acting, she proved that again after 'Highway', Shahid Kapoor as an eccentric Punjabi pop star was believable. After a long time Kareena Kapoor is in a powerful role and really did a good job. But the surprise package is for sure 'Diljit Dosanjh' who stood out with his awesome performance., A popular face in Punjab film industry but lesser known in Bollywood did an awesome job, we definitely want see more of him in upcoming flicks.The only drawback is probably the length of the movie which felt stretched at few places. In short this is everything from the director of 'Ishqiya' and 'Dedh Ishqiya' you would expect. Don't miss it........",all about drug abuse its after effects,its dark depressing delicious drama that abhishek chaubey served hot at table unseen hidden face punjab province which is known different reputation when i heard all noises about producers movie censor board locking horns i thought it might just be another publicity gimmick boy i was wrong it indeed left state leaders administration red faced even if this may not picture entire state punjab unholy nexus between drug lords politicians administration is shown here alia bhatt may be low gk but high acting she proved that again after highway shahid kapoor as eccentric punjabi pop star was believable after long time kareena kapoor is powerful role really did good job but surprise package is sure diljit dosanjh who stood out with his awesome performance popular face punjab film industry but lesser known bollywood did awesome job we definitely want see more him upcoming flicks only drawback is probably length movie which felt stretched at few places short this is everything director ishqiya dedh ishqiya you would expect dont miss it,0.5445740740740741,0.16644444444444448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8,First-Class Tragedy. ♦ Grade B+,"There was only one way to find out if the film, a topic of controversy since late May this year, was worthy of all the fuss: to watch it. And it was a genuinely poignant experience to watch Ishqiya-fame Abhishek Chaubey's crime drama unfold and speak volumes about a state in grave peril.Tommy (Kapoor) is a London-bred Punjabi rock-star who goes by the name Gabru among his fans. Cocaine is a prime ingredient in his lavish lifestyle which soon becomes evident to the viewers who witness his and his crew's eccentricity and madness. One of his little-known fans is Bali (Prabhjyot) who regards Gabru as his idol and cocaine as his medicine. The person who has no idea about Bali's frequent bouts of psychedelic enjoyment is his brother Sartaj (Dosanjh), a cop and a minor yet ignorant player in the corrupted law-enforcement system of Punjab. Dr. Sahni (Khan) is the only major character in the story who doesn't do drugs, and is more of a crusader against them than a medical practitioner. Slightly deviated from all these personages is a Bihari migrant and hockey ace (Bhatt) who was promised a national-level tournament but was handed an insecticide spraying machine instead. Things take a virulent turn for all of them when, one by one, Tommy gets jailed, Bali gets hospitalized, Sartaj gets taunted by Dr. Sahni for his role in the drug problem, and the migrant getting entangled in a petty peddling issue.It doesn't take much time for the writers to set the scene and let drugs take on the remaining part. And it is also evident what they really had in mind: to explicitly showcase the drug menace in the state and its horrendous consequences, some of which are worse than death. Perhaps the best scene of the film and a scene where the viewers will definitely get a jolt if they are paying attention is when Gabru finds himself locked up in a shared jail cell where also are sitting two of his hardcore teen fans who were arrested for hitting their own mother after she refused to give them money to buy drugs, a habit which they directly imbibed from their rock-star. Brilliant!The score is absolutely stunning as it supports the sequences in unleashing their total effect. With some fabulous sampling of songs, the narration is pretty straightforward, if not crisp. It does go haywire a couple of times, but they are brief and were probably mandatory for easy flow of the script. Outstanding performances by Kapoor and Bhatt. It is isn't easy to portray such characters. Dosanjh is fine and so is his co-actor who seemed to go into Jab We Met mode at times. Supporting cast is good, especially Satish Kaushik.With a fast-paced climax, the film is gritty, dark, gory, and tragic for all the stories that intertwine towards the end shut shop once the idea is successfully resonated. It doesn't establish nonsense.BOTTOM LINE: Abhishek Chaubey's Udta Punjab is an important film that only cares about exhibiting the current scenario of a state embroiled in a drug menace. It almost makes you believe in the story, which everyone knows is at least partially true. Go watch it in your nearest theater.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

8,Its not a movie its reality,"The movie is not just any kinda movie with fun and laughter. Its the truth that someone had to bring out eventually. I am glad that Supreme Court intervened and minimized the cuts otherwise a piece of art would have been sacrificed. After seeing the movie you will realize that how sad it is that a state that once had a martyr born in every house has now being replaced by a druggie in every house. Its an old saying that if you want to destroy a country targeting its youth is one of the many initial steps one takes. And it takes only minutes of watch to see who supplies the drugs. That is just one aspect and not just that, the movie then focuses its attention to the basic route and mode of operation of this cartel.This is a must watch movie and one must not just watch it for fun rather one must feel pity for the sorry state of the state that once bubbled with life and energy. As the story revolves around four characters independently at first they are later interwoven though not the best but in an appreciable manner. Shahid and Alia steal the show. There characters are flawless and there screenplay is superb. Diljit the apple of eye of all Punjabi added his best bits and his work is worth commending. I did feel that after the interval the movie was bit too long. The flaw is in editing section and it could have been a lot better. It could have been chipped in some places and it could have saved a few minutes that gave a lethargic feeling. But anyways, overall the movie was worth a watch and a to be recommended one as well.

8,Astonishing but Brutal Truth,"UDTA PUNJAB - After so much struggle the movie lastly got its deserving release on this Friday. At first the censor board wanted 80 something cuts with A certificate , then it falls to 30 something cuts with A certificate and lastly the decision by the High Court - A Certificate with just one cut. Its alarming to my mind how can 80 something cuts falls to just 1 cut , that's a huge gap , and proves that something very wrong is going on with the Censor Board. After watching the film I don't know what they want to cut , yes there were whole lot of cursed words , a lot of violenceand some indicated rape scenes but nothing was shown , but that's exactly the point of giving it an A CERTIFICATE . Because its not a film for anyone below 18. And then a cheap step taken by the Censor Board , they leaked the print on TORRENT to disrupt the commercial business of the movie. I personally cant request anyone to not download it and go to theater to watch it which anyone would have done in case leak hasn't been happened , but i can definitely say that if this movie get flopped on box office then it would be a shame on every movie lover and a win for Censor Board. And i don't even know whom to blame. So a movie by Abhishek Chaubey. Anybody who knows him will agree with me that Abhishek Chaubey can be described as an Amalgamation between Anurag Kashyap (who produced udta punjab) and Vishal Bhardawaj (who produced two early film of Abhishek). UDTA PUNJAB can itself can be explained as a combination of KAMINEY and GANGS OF WASSYPUR , not by its theme but by the style and treatment. I liked ISHQIYA debut movie by Abhishek and i loved Dedh ISHQIYA which was even better. And i surly liked Udta Punjab as much as Dedh Ishqiya. For a start Abhishek's PUNJAB doesn't exist on the same planet in which YRF'S or DHARMA production's PUNJAB exists. Both PUNJABS are exact opposite. The PUNJAB here is not romantic and the youth here doesn't sing romantic songs with their lovers because they were too busy ruining their life using Drugs. One very good thing what movie did was how it managed to show the whole PUNJAB around four different characters.The Movie starts with a kick when a DISCUS THROWER throws a packet of drug from Pakistan to his Punjab dealer across border. Which was found by a unnamed Bihari migrant hockey player (played by Alia Bhatt) who thinks selling those drugs can bring good times to her life , but was unaware of the dark days which are in front of her because of her involvement with Drug Mafia. Alia Bhatt has been so much made fun of her lack of General Knowledge. But in his Bollywood carrier she has shown so much Intelligence in selecting movies. This character was very difficult to pull of with also Bihari Accent , but Alia did it perfectly . Watch out for the scene when she describe her past to TOMMY , it will make you feel so much for her (very similar to the scene when Alia described her past to Randeep in HIGHWAY) . Also applause for the make up department to make Alia look like a labour girl who works in the field. Then there is TOMMY (Shahid Kapoor) , a role model for the youth. Who sing songs on Drugs and his fans made those songs their Philosophy. The character of TOMMY represents directly the singers like Honey Singh and other rappers who don't know to how to make songs other then Alcohol and Girls. Shahid pulls the character with style. His looks suited him perfectly. This was the best performance by Shahid since Kaminey. Then comes Sartaj Singh (Diljit) a corrupt police officer who loves to go with the flow of the system and arrangement with the drug dealers until he found his own brother fighting for his life against the drugs. Everyone knows Diljit as a singer. But very few people knows that he is already a superstar in Punjab movie industry. In fact out of 5 highest grossing Punjabi movies Four have Diljit as the main lead . Before this in total i had seen two Punjabi movie of Diljit and i liked him a lot. And for very long time i was waiting for his Bollywood debut. Diljit gave a subtle but great performance. Love to see him in more Bollywood movies. Kareena Kapoor Khan's character was the simplest one , of a doctor who helps drug addict and wants to bring some change in the system . Kareena was good too in her performance. In showing reality the Director and Writers have taken great help from injecting humor. But it never seems forced. Every Joke in the movie came like a normal sentence which can come out of a normal person in that particular situation. And let me tell you , i have laugh a lot in this movie. The humor too was very similar to Dedh Ishqiya and Gangs of Wassypur. The movie was fast paced , with some very little drag moments in second half mostly due to the love angels which could have been deleted totally , but they will not bother you much. Music was not so good when it came out , but in the movie it matched the situations excellently. Not a single song to bore. I am very much Happy with the fact that i went to watch the movie in Theater and not seen it on my laptop with leaked print because i don't think the effect remains same.

10,10/10 simply for showing Pahlaj Nihalani's hypocrisy,"It is just a matter of coincidence that I happened to know about Anurag Kashyap just before Udta Punjab was going to come in controversies. I had watched Bombay Velvet, which I don't think is a good way to learn about a director's work (later on I got to know Return of Hanuman was also made by Anurag Kashyap so that settles that). And when this film was stuck in controversies, it got leaked and everyone watched it. I didn't see it back then since my 12th class was going on, but I did see it a few years back. And boy have we grown as an audience!Udta Punjab is basically something every OTT show is doing nowadays. I really like how Anurag Kashyap isn't afraid of CBFC. He made Gangs of Wasseypur parts 1 & 2 which are now being copied to make most OTT shows, then he made this film, which talks about the drug problems in Punjab. Kashyap's films are always very grounded and unlike most Bollywood directors, he is actually interested in making them look that way. Other directors want to keep their films grounded, but always add unrealistic things which make their films a washer-man's dog: Neither realistic nor unrealistic. Anurag Kashyap, however, goes all out on the ghetto look and touch, which is very well reflected in this film. No wonder why it got so much censored.Udta Punjab tells the story of four different perspectives when it comes to drug consumption in Punjab. There is Tommy Singh aka Gabru (played by Shahid Kapoor and the only character from this film whose name I remember), who is a drug addict and has just realised the errors of his ways. Now he is trying his best to become clean, but the life he has already created beforehand does not allow him to become a better person. There is Alia Bhatt who is a Bihari immigrant who has been kidnapped and is now being used for sexual favours. There is Diljit Dosanjh who is trying his best to capture the drug mafia when his own younger brother has become a drug addict, and then there is Kareena Kapoor Khan who is a social worker, working alongside Diljit to prevent drug consumption in Punjab.Everything about this film is excellent. The acting, music, story, cinematography, everything lands in place. There are no plot holes in spite of having so many subplots, and in the end all of that comes together. Tommy Singh was my favourite character, and every time he was on the screen I just wanted to see him. When he was gone I would wait for his scenes to come, since his story was the most suspenseful. The film does have some parts where the characters talk like how people don't usually talk like in real life, like the part where Tommy is in jail and the two kids tell they were addicted to drugs and that's why they killed their parents. The way they talk sounds very unrealistic. Then Alia Bhatt also did not suit a Bihari look at all. She was clearly looking black faced and her accent sounded awfully fake. But other than that I don't have any problem.Udta Punjab is one of those films that I'd call era-defining. It not only exposed Pahlaj Nihalani's hypocrisy in deciding what is correct for the Indian audience and what isn't, but it also helped in getting him kicked out and bringing Prasoon Joshi in his place. Today a film like Udta Punjab can be easily made, but the society's mindset 5 years ago was very different from now. This is a very positive change and I hope we see the same decline in people getting offended over historical and religious depictions in films and OTT shows.",10 10 simply showing pahlaj nihalanis hypocrisy,it is just matter coincidence that i happened know about anurag kashyap just before udta punjab was going come controversies i had watched bombay velvet which i dont think is good way learn about directors work later i got know return hanuman was also made by anurag kashyap so that settles that when this film was stuck controversies it got leaked everyone watched it i didnt see it back then since my 12th class was going but i did see it few years back boy have we grown as audience udta punjab is basically something every ott show is doing nowadays i really like how anurag kashyap isnt afraid cbfc he made gangs wasseypur parts 1 2 which are now being copied make most ott shows then he made this film which talks about drug problems punjab kashyaps films are always very grounded unlike most bollywood directors he is actually interested making them look that way other directors want keep their films grounded but always add unrealistic things which make their films washer mans dog neither realistic nor unrealistic anurag kashyap however goes all out ghetto look touch which is very well reflected this film no wonder why it got so much censored udta punjab tells story four different perspectives when it comes drug consumption punjab there is tommy singh aka gabru played by shahid kapoor only character this film whose name i remember who is drug addict has just realised errors his ways now he is trying his best become clean but life he has already created beforehand does not allow him become better person there is alia bhatt who is bihari immigrant who has been kidnapped is now being used sexual favours there is diljit dosanjh who is trying his best capture drug mafia when his own younger brother has become drug addict then there is kareena kapoor khan who is social worker working alongside diljit prevent drug consumption punjab everything about this film is excellent acting music story cinematography everything lands place there are no plot holes spite having so many subplots end all that comes together tommy singh was my favourite character every time he was screen i just wanted see him when he was gone i would wait his scenes come since his story was most suspenseful film does have some parts where characters talk like how people dont usually talk like real life like part where tommy is jail two kids tell they were addicted drugs thats why they killed their parents way they talk sounds very unrealistic then alia bhatt also did not suit bihari look at all she was clearly looking black faced her accent sounded awfully fake but other than that i dont have any problem udta punjab is one those films that id call era defining it not only exposed pahlaj nihalanis hypocrisy deciding what is correct indian audience what isnt but it also helped getting him kicked out bringing prasoon joshi his place today film like udta punjab can be easily made but societys mindset 5 years ago was very different now this is very positive change i hope we see same decline people getting offended over historical religious depictions films ott shows,0.470091341991342,0.11257575757575757,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.35}"

Al tough the movie plot is based on a serious issue but the approach is humorous and comes with a message that can change ones prescriptive.I have great admiration for actors in the movie, Shahid Kapoor acting has reached another benchmark and class, he has given his best in every shot. Alia bhat , you won my heart!! Another cult performance after highway. Diljit Dosanjh a great debut looks very perfect in Jat munda cop character. Kareena as usual like jab we met and all her acting will go completely unnoticed in front of great actors and this is not her cup of tea.Songs like UDTA Punjab title track and chitta ve gives you a spark and personal favorite song ""Ikk Kudi"" and they fit in to the movie scenes nicely.A worth watch, I watched the leaked version and Would like to see this in theater as well as this is not something that you see commonly in these days movies.",one my favorite garnering good ratings imdb,udta punjab best movie i have ever seen over couple years i was captivated watching movie it left me spellbound hats off film makers making such bold movie drug abuse this movie show real fact narco polities how system is linked with drug mafia al tough movie plot is based serious issue but approach is humorous comes with message that can change ones prescriptive i have great admiration actors movie shahid kapoor acting has reached another benchmark class he has given his best every shot alia bhat you won my heart another cult performance after highway diljit dosanjh great debut looks very perfect jat munda cop character kareena as usual like jab we met all her acting will go completely unnoticed front great actors this is not her cup tea songs like udta punjab title track chitta ve gives you spark personal favorite song ikk kudi they fit movie scenes nicely worth watch i watched leaked version would like see this theater as well as this is not something that you see commonly these days movies,0.5236111111111111,0.30671296296296297,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8,"Dark, relevant & to the point with great performances by the assemble cast!","UDTA PUNJAB is worth the hype. And not in terms of all the bad things said about it, it's genuinely an eye opener. It talks about the drug scenario in the youth of Punjab in a very relevant and realistic way. Following the three disclaimers initially, film is a pure truth under the camouflage of fiction.UDTA PUNJAB revolves around the four lead characters connected with the substance abuse. Tommy Singh (Shahid Kapoor) is so high, under his fading success that you can't guess what he will do next. He is the direct result of what we consume and idolize. The persona, the crass, the love for hate, Tommy has it all. Shahid Kapoor's skin deep Tommy is a must watch. And so is Alia Bhatt. A Bihari migrant worker trying to make her life better, ends up in an unexpected mess. She takes you just by one strike, down and out. Alia Bhatt is not a pleasant surprise in such a different part, but an emerging talent which might level out all other to the ground. See it to believe it! Preet (Kareena Kapoor Khan) is a Doctor working at rehabilitation for the addicts is good and bold in her approach. She looks more bright with here curious eyes and that connects. And Sartaj Singh (Diljit Dosanjh) is a cop stuck between money and wrong. He is so true and innocent till his core and from there on what we see is solid performance. What a debut!UDTA PUNJAB is choppy at places, but I love the transitions with the structure. The edit is not much to talk about, but it sets a pace with gripping background music. Second half is bit slow and few things looks like losing control. Songs are good and my personal favorite is Ikk Kudi It's still there, humming somewhere. Characters speaks out from real life. And Punjab is captured in such a realism, thank god, no mustard fields this time. Language is well taken care off, it's very true to the way we speak. And this is the most important aspect of UDTA PUNJAB for me, its authenticity! The unconventional story telling might not be for everyone, but it's intriguing. Technically UDTA PUNJAB is not in its best form which itself is a way to take story forward. Cheers to Abhishek Chaubey for this.UDTA PUNJAB is neither a great film, not a path-breaking technical scorer. It's a mirror which some wanted to smash before we could see.

7,A Well-Made Film with Superb Performances!,"After much hype, controversy & headlines, 'Udta Punjab' is finally out & has been watched. And fortunately, this is a Well-Made Film, Directed Honestly by Abhishek Chaubey. Also, the Performances are SUPERB by all. Despite flaws, 'Udta Punjab' dares to tell a horrifying truth, without sugarcoating! Commendable!'Udta Punjab' revolves around the drug abuse in the affluent north Indian State of Punjab and how 4 four lives intervene, involving A Cop (Diljit Dosanjh), A Doctor (Kareena Kapoor Khan), a Bihari migrant (Alia Bhatt) & A Rockstar (Shahid Kapoor). 'Udta Punjab' gets into the grassroots of the doomed state & explores the journey's of its characters. You watch a naive girl sell drugs & later pay for it in a horrifying way. You watch a Rockstar fading due to his fatal addiction. You also watch the Cop's younger sibling succumb to drugs. 'Udta Punjab' is a relentless tale on the dark side of Punjab & how the drugs are ruining the state. If you thought Punjab on celluloid is all about Yash Chopra's clean green fields, well then, 'Udta Punjab' shows an all new side altogether. However, 'Udta Punjab' doesn't soar entirely. The pacing is inconsistent, while the romantic-angle in the second-hour, doesn't work. Despite such intensity, watching the narrative shift (though only for a brief time) into shy romance, just doesn't fit in & appears forced. 'Udta Punjab' has a terrific first-hour (despite inconsistency of its pacing) where things get uglier & more affecting, but the second-hour is flawed. A better second-hour would've made this daring attempt, even deeper. Sudip Sharma & Chaubey's Screenplay is great, but in parts. The Writing isn't as strong the subject it tackles & one certainly feels slightly underwhelmed by that. Nonetheless, The Writing has some genuine merit. The Dialogue are excellent & YES the Cuss Words add to the narrative massively. Chaubey's Direction is Honest. He directs 'Udta Punjab' without any inhibitions & presents a story, that's dark & also disturbing. Kudos to Chaubey for delivering his story with sincerity. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is sharp, but could've been tighter. Art & Costume Design are superb. Make-Up is well-done. Amit Trivedi's Score is Brilliant. Now Coming To The Performances! Alia Bhatt steals the show & how! If you thought Highway was the actress at her finest, wait till you watch 'Udta Punjab'. As the tormented & drug-addicted Bihari migrant, Alia transforms into the part. Her Bihari dialect is flawless & the range of emotions she displays, are simply awe-inspiring. Its a Knockout Performance all the way!Coming next in line is Shahid Kapoor, who ignites the screen with sheer madness. As the obnoxious Tommy Singh, Shahid is at his most zaniest, delivering a delightful turn, although a change of heart in his character (in the second-hour), isn't convincing enough. Nonetheless, Shahid Shines!Diljit Dosanjh lends maturity as well as intensity as the honest & concerned cop, while Kareena Kapoor Khan is wonderfully restrained as the caring & lovable doctor. And although their romance doesn't leave an impact, both the actors lend weight to their parts.A special mention for the Impeccable Satish Kaushik, who's astounding as Shahid's uncle/manager. On the whole, 'Udta Punjab' is definitely worth a watch, despite some flaws. And it needs to be watched at the CINEMA. NOT anywhere else.",well made film with superb performances,after much hype controversy headlines udta punjab is finally out has been watched fortunately this is well made film directed honestly by abhishek chaubey also performances are superb by all despite flaws udta punjab dares tell horrifying truth without sugarcoating commendable udta punjab revolves around drug abuse affluent north indian state punjab how 4 four lives intervene involving cop diljit dosanjh doctor kareena kapoor khan bihari migrant alia bhatt rockstar shahid kapoor udta punjab gets into grassroots doomed state explores journeys its characters you watch naive girl sell drugs later pay it horrifying way you watch rockstar fading due his fatal addiction you also watch cops younger sibling succumb drugs udta punjab is relentless tale dark side punjab how drugs are ruining state if you thought punjab celluloid is all about yash chopras clean green fields well then udta punjab shows all new side altogether however udta punjab doesnt soar entirely pacing is inconsistent while romantic angle second hour doesnt work despite such intensity watching narrative shift though only brief time into shy romance just doesnt fit appears forced udta punjab has terrific first hour despite inconsistency its pacing where things get uglier more affecting but second hour is flawed better second hour wouldve made this daring attempt even deeper sudip sharma chaubeys screenplay is great but parts writing isnt as strong subject it tackles one certainly feels slightly underwhelmed by that nonetheless writing has some genuine merit dialogue are excellent yes cuss words add narrative massively chaubeys direction is honest he directs udta punjab without any inhibitions presents story thats dark also disturbing kudos chaubey delivering his story with sincerity cinematography is perfect editing is sharp but couldve been tighter art costume design are superb make up is well done amit trivedis score is brilliant now coming performances alia bhatt steals show how if you thought highway was actress at her finest wait till you watch udta punjab as tormented drug addicted bihari migrant alia transforms into part her bihari dialect is flawless range emotions she displays are simply awe inspiring its knockout performance all way coming next line is shahid kapoor who ignites screen with sheer madness as obnoxious tommy singh shahid is at his most zaniest delivering delightful turn although change heart his character second hour isnt convincing enough nonetheless shahid shines diljit dosanjh lends maturity as well as intensity as honest concerned cop while kareena kapoor khan is wonderfully restrained as caring lovable doctor although their romance doesnt leave impact both actors lend weight their parts special mention impeccable satish kaushik whos astounding as shahids uncle manager whole udta punjab is definitely worth watch despite some flaws it needs be watched at cinema not anywhere else,0.6075305291723202,0.22051431155908768,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.18}"
9,This is called movie...go and watch it,"Still not watching !!!...go now and watch it...Yes UDTA PUNJAB is a one of the best movie of Bollywood. After finally cleared by Bombay high court with the cuts reduced from 89 to 1 today Udta Punjab released all over India. Thanks to Indian Censor Board...they make the film famous in all over India. Acting is marvelous. But it is very sad for the Udta Punjab team that it has been already leaked in torrent. I request to torrent down-loader..please watch it in cinema hall as the sound and picture quality are not so clear in torrent uploading video. Anyway the story is about mainly on drugs. The film shows first different plots and then emerged into one plot.Shahid Kapoor acting as Tommy Singh; one of the most famous singer of Punjab. But without consuming drugs; Tommy Singh unable to create music.Diljit Dosanjh acting as Sartaj Singh; a police inspector who gives permission to illegal transport by taking money i.e., corruption officer. Kareena Kapoor as Dr. Preet Sahni; always helps others and complete against drugs, corruption.Alia Bhatt as Kumari Pinky; the girl from Bihar accidentally found 2kg powder packet of drugs and her life changes when coming to sell to a drug driller.Story goes on and then suddenly their life turn into a different track. Tommy Singh arrested in his birthday party, Sartaj Singh found his brother in hospital under the guidance of Dr Preet Singh, Kumari Pinky met Tommy one night and.........sorry i can't describe everything. You should go to theater and watch it.What an acting..! Shahid, Alia, Kareena, Diljit everyone show their best performance. Diljit's brother performance is great. He perfectly played his role.

7,Echoes of chaos from Punjab,"Abhishek Chaubey makes a winning change with Udta Punjab, a film about the rampant drug menace in the state of Punjab. Chaubey's portrayal of this region is horrifying, to say the least, presenting a world of terrible destruction and filth which is almost dystopian. Udta Punjab is an unusual film in this regard, it is real and authentic in execution, with lifelike dialogue which includes profanity hardly seen in mainstream Hindi films, and similarly lifelike sets. The film gets very disturbing at points, but at the same time the direction is good enough and balances the negativity.The casting presents excellent performances, balancing between two pairs of actors, the first two fighting the drug system and the other two being its victims. While the film's two main leads, the hardly recognisable Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, are the central players here, they are actually more of character actors in this setting, and their stories are presented against the larger backdrop, where Diljit Dosanjh and Kareena Kapoor loosen the intensity with their positive characters who are in many ways the heroes of the film. It is actually a wonderful writing decision.Shahid Kapoor is like one has never seen. His mannerisms and expressions and his entire attention to detail are really impressive. He does get a little too wide-eyed in his hysterical outbursts, but it's effective within the film's context, and his is a fantastic, convincing turn. It is Alia Bhatt, however, who dominates this film in a much smaller role which digs deep into the human soul. Aside from her mastery of the Bihari accent, she plays the film's most difficult scenes with unsettling, harrowing intensity. And her character remains incredibly optimistic all though. It is a heartbreaking performance.Dosanjh is a great new find as Sartraj, and he is very convincing as the tough, no-nonsense but kindly levelheaded cop whose moral values are always intact. He has great presence, and his seemingly unlikely chemistry with Kareena is wonderfully built and developed throughout the story. Indeed, these two are responsible for the lighter part of the film, and the bonding their common, novel mission brings about is very touching. Credit should also go to Kareena, the lady star foregoing vanity to play a most regular character with minimal importance and doing it gracefully.Udta Punjab will surely be accused of a biased, overly negative presentation of the state of Punjab, and not without a reason actually. Those unfamiliar with India might find themselves scared to visit this area of India. While Chaubey mitigates the film's horrors with nice music and other redeeming qualities, he does not do the same with the image of Punjab. At the end of it all, the film is still very watchable, mainly for the performances and the brutally honest portrayal of the destruction of drugs. In this regard, it is interesting and engaging even if not necessarily a fun watch.",echoes chaos punjab,abhishek chaubey makes winning change with udta punjab film about rampant drug menace state punjab chaubeys portrayal this region is horrifying say least presenting world terrible destruction filth which is almost dystopian udta punjab is unusual film this regard it is real authentic execution with lifelike dialogue which includes profanity hardly seen mainstream hindi films similarly lifelike sets film gets very disturbing at points but at same time direction is good enough balances negativity casting presents excellent performances balancing between two pairs actors first two fighting drug system other two being its victims while films two main leads hardly recognisable shahid kapoor alia bhatt are central players here they are actually more character actors this setting their stories are presented against larger backdrop where diljit dosanjh kareena kapoor loosen intensity with their positive characters who are many ways heroes film it is actually wonderful writing decision shahid kapoor is like one has never seen his mannerisms expressions his entire attention detail are really impressive he does get little too wide eyed his hysterical outbursts but its effective within films context his is fantastic convincing turn it is alia bhatt however who dominates this film much smaller role which digs deep into human soul aside her mastery bihari accent she plays films most difficult scenes with unsettling harrowing intensity her character remains incredibly optimistic all though it is heartbreaking performance dosanjh is great new find as sartraj he is very convincing as tough no nonsense but kindly levelheaded cop whose moral values are always intact he has great presence his seemingly unlikely chemistry with kareena is wonderfully built developed throughout story indeed these two are responsible lighter part film bonding their common novel mission brings about is very touching credit should also go kareena lady star foregoing vanity play most regular character with minimal importance doing it gracefully udta punjab will surely be accused biased overly negative presentation state punjab not without reason actually those unfamiliar with india might find themselves scared visit this area india while chaubey mitigates films horrors with nice music other redeeming qualities he does not do same with image punjab at end it all film is still very watchable mainly performances brutally honest portrayal destruction drugs this regard it is interesting engaging even if not necessarily fun watch,0.606727626948215,0.16893010992275692,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"
7,Drugs ki Maa Di,"This movie has been in Buzz for the last 1 month or so due to various reasons. I'll not discuss those as most of us are already aware about the same. But is the movie worth the hype that it managed to generate ? Well the answer is Yes and a No. i.e is partially some scenes are brilliant whereas you will sense mediocrity after that.Story revolves in 3 to 4 sub plots that give us the introduction of the characters.We are Introduced to Tommy Singh ( Shahid Kapoor) a pop star who speaks and creates music that is vulgar and loud ..may be reference to Honey Singh who knows.. Anyways he is best at what a Celebrity Rock star here a Pop star can do and is deep into drugs and has his own challenges with his music and his life.2nd Alia Bhatt referred to a Bihari Girl who was a state level Hockey player and now forced to work in farms in Punjab. Wants to make big by selling theft drugs which ultimately ruins her life and her challenge overcoming the same.3rd Sartaj Singh ( Diljit Dosanjh) a Cop who wants to eradicate the Drug mafia when he comes to know his younger brother is into drugs by taking help of Preet Sahani (Kareena Kapoor) a Doctor working at rehabilitation for the Drug addicts.The Characters are linked as victims. You will not see a direct link among st the major characters , Kareena and Shahid do not even have a single scene together. Alia is also introduced to Shahid during the 2nd half.Overall the directors attempt to expose the drug situation in Punjab is commendable but the movie goes kid dish in parts...This movie could have been a notch higher if the director could have worked hard on the climax. The Plot seemed to be hassled towards the end. And people killing each other so easily gives you a laugh. The entire hard work that was put in to build the plot was wasted in the end and how many times do we see this in Hindi movies. No resolution was given at the end and it is up to the viewers to decide what happens.Though Alia and Shahid do have a happy ending don't know how? The director never gave the explanation how the protagonists got away after killing peopleActing .. Shahid is in Top form and gives a scintillating performance after Haider, Alia has experimented a lot in this movie and was De glamorized for the role though at times she looks quite out of sorts playing a Bihari girl. Kareena is OK Diljit Dosanjh does a good job.. Overall the movie is sleek and shows the problem in Punjab with sincerity. Go watch the movie for some good acting and the truth of Punjab problem",drugs ki maa di,this movie has been buzz last 1 month or so due various reasons ill not discuss those as most us are already aware about same but is movie worth hype that it managed generate well answer is yes no i e is partially some scenes are brilliant whereas you will sense mediocrity after that story revolves 3 4 sub plots that give us introduction characters we are introduced tommy singh shahid kapoor pop star who speaks creates music that is vulgar loud may be reference honey singh who knows anyways he is best at what celebrity rock star here pop star can do is deep into drugs has his own challenges with his music his life 2nd alia bhatt referred bihari girl who was state level hockey player now forced work farms punjab wants make big by selling theft drugs which ultimately ruins her life her challenge overcoming same 3rd sartaj singh diljit dosanjh cop who wants eradicate drug mafia when he comes know his younger brother is into drugs by taking help preet sahani kareena kapoor doctor working at rehabilitation drug addicts characters are linked as victims you will not see direct link among st major characters kareena shahid do not even have single scene together alia is also introduced shahid during 2nd half overall directors attempt expose drug situation punjab is commendable but movie goes kid dish parts this movie could have been notch higher if director could have worked hard climax plot seemed be hassled towards end people killing each other so easily gives you laugh entire hard work that was put build plot was wasted end how many times do we see this hindi movies no resolution was given at end it is up viewers decide what happens though alia shahid do have happy ending dont know how director never gave explanation how protagonists got away after killing people acting shahid is top form gives scintillating performance after haider alia has experimented lot this movie was de glamorized role though at times she looks quite out sorts playing bihari girl kareena is ok diljit dosanjh does good job overall movie is sleek shows problem punjab with sincerity go watch movie some good acting truth punjab problem,0.35498511904761904,0.11821676587301588,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.49}"
4,Not a propaganda or a political film but just a very average one .....,"Dear Abhishek Chaubey, I do not understand why a lot of people called Udta Punjab a propaganda film. It is not a propaganda film by any stretch of the imagination. It is also NOT a political film. Some reviewers have written that it is a political film. I do not know why. But Chaubey, I do think that you are a very shallow person. You wanted to make a violent and comedic action film about junkies/drug addicts. Nothing wrong with that. But I question your decision to set the film in Punjab. I mean, there is almost nothing about Punjab in this film. The way i see it, you had no interest in Punjab or its drug problems but set the movie there for the sake of a locating it in an exotic milieu. Udta Punjab's general tone indicated to me that you wanted to make an entertaining film like Trainspotting. So I am not sure why you added all the blatant anti drug characters like the ones played by Kareena and that police officer. The film's comedic scenes were as bad as something written by Milap Zaveri. The lawless badlands vibe seemed to be something out of a Tigmanshu Dhulia film. The visual style was borrowed from Danny Boyle films (you even ripped off that diving into the water scene from Trainspotting or paid homage as they call it these days).I still don't know why Punjabi youth are drug addicted. Is it a rebellion against patriarchal values? Lack of opportunities? At the beginning of the film, there is a scene where someone from across the border threw a package containing heroin into India. But the narcoterrorism angle is not explored any further. The film's anti-drug message is flimsy and seems to have been added as an after thought. Shahid Kapoor's guilt and his anti-drug speech on stage were phony. Aliya Bhatt's character beating up gangsters single handedly with a hockey stick was hard to believe. And even worse, her recovery from months of drug and sexual abuse is handled without even a hint of authenticity or craftsmanship. You and the producers seem to have used the censor board ban controversy to your advantage. All the critics and film goers aligned themselves with you. Nothing wrong with that. But your film lacks genuineness and its apparent concern for the drug addled youth of Punjab comes across as utterly fake. The film mostly uses the drug using scenes and Punjabi youths affinity towards drugs and the fast life to evoke laughter in the audience. So it was hard to take the anti-drug message seriously. The morons in the Indian censor board helped catapult a scarily banal film like Udta Punjab into a critical and box office success. Best Regards, Pimpin.

7,"A new and unique story, but some more work needed","There are parts where the language seems to play the tricky part because of repeated abuses. It would be a great thing if Anurag compromised a bit with the abuses so that the film will reach the audience it was meant to. The Music of the movie sucks after first half. I appreciate Sudip Sharma and Abhishek Chaubey, the writers of the movie but I feel the director Chaubey missed the opportunity to make it interesting. There are a few dull moments in the second half, but the climax packs a punch. The way the worlds of a cop, a heroin addict, a rock star and a doctor intersect is cleverly shown. Story is good but the music, dialogues and direction is quite unpalatable. Udta Punjab does not manage to fly high.You should go watch it. Overall an average movie with a good story. My rating for this movie is 3.5/5.",new unique story but some more work needed,there are parts where language seems play tricky part because repeated abuses it would be great thing if anurag compromised bit with abuses so that film will reach audience it was meant music movie sucks after first half i appreciate sudip sharma abhishek chaubey writers movie but i feel director chaubey missed opportunity make it interesting there are few dull moments second half but climax packs punch way worlds cop heroin addict rock star doctor intersect is cleverly shown story is good but music dialogues direction is quite unpalatable udta punjab does not manage fly high you should go watch it overall average movie with good story my rating this movie is 3 5 5,0.4549760765550238,0.2006858054226475,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"
2,Makers were High while making this film,"Film stumbles on all it's tracks without any clear cut vision. There are three plots. Accidentally a girl finds a drug packet, which she wants to sell first, then destroys it and then we come to know that she was state level Hockey player of Bihar!? What a kiddies portray of character. There is no use of her being a Hockey player rather than introducing her with Hockey stick and suddenly hitting few goons with a stick with suddenly smashes her image of poor girl. A singer who is youth icon for drugs abuse, again no clarification of his initial behavour and if he was so addicted then how can just seeing a girl in first sight will make him realize his mistakes and he takes decision to be a Savior for her. A corrupt cop soul awakes about his wrong doing when his own brother gets victim of drug abuse, then he investigates the nexus in Police dress and nobody sees him, suddenly he becomes invisible man to others and yes he takes a girl along with him even being aware of the dangers. This cop and girl track ends so abruptly, makers would have been thought that you will be too emotional but actually you will be puzzled that what is it. A person pierced accidentally a needle into a cop's back of neck and even he does not notice it like it was done by some very skillful medical professional. A persons has injured legs so he limps but when he has to run from cops, he rids a cycle with rising on it pedals without any pain. There was no any clear cut motto behind making this film, what they want to show and why? Was it drug consequences or the drug trafficking or a cop tries to eradicate the drug mafia. All things are unanswered. Initially one page prologue says that it is about drug terrorism but then after a very first shot this angle was lost completely but I loved that shot of drug being thrown across border and then title of film coming over captured frame of that drug packed flying high. There are just common problems shown in this film, without any solution and touching emotional angle. Climax is so hurried that you start laughing of all that high octane scenes which comes in jiff. Performance is only good thing about this movie. Shahid Kapoor as Tommy Singh is just adorable. The way he keeps his jaw dropped, intrigue sparkle in his eyes and above the note body language are just too good. He has carried this character in fantastic way. Alia Bhatt as Bihari laborer is first rate. She gets one performance oriented scene and she does awesome. Her looks and body language is impeccable, yes she speaks dialogues which are meant to be serious but few times it evokes laughter. Kareena Kapoor Khan and Diljit Dosanjh are just OK due to lack of good scenes for them.",makers were high while making this film,film stumbles all its tracks without any clear cut vision there are three plots accidentally girl finds drug packet which she wants sell first then destroys it then we come know that she was state level hockey player bihar what kiddies portray character there is no use her being hockey player rather than introducing her with hockey stick suddenly hitting few goons with stick with suddenly smashes her image poor girl singer who is youth icon drugs abuse again no clarification his initial behavour if he was so addicted then how can just seeing girl first sight will make him realize his mistakes he takes decision be savior her corrupt cop soul awakes about his wrong doing when his own brother gets victim drug abuse then he investigates nexus police dress nobody sees him suddenly he becomes invisible man others yes he takes girl along with him even being aware dangers this cop girl track ends so abruptly makers would have been thought that you will be too emotional but actually you will be puzzled that what is it person pierced accidentally needle into cops back neck even he does not notice it like it was done by some very skillful medical professional persons has injured legs so he limps but when he has run cops he rids cycle with rising it pedals without any pain there was no any clear cut motto behind making this film what they want show why was it drug consequences or drug trafficking or cop tries eradicate drug mafia all things are unanswered initially one page prologue says that it is about drug terrorism but then after very first shot this angle was lost completely but i loved that shot drug being thrown across border then title film coming over captured frame that drug packed flying high there are just common problems shown this film without any solution touching emotional angle climax is so hurried that you start laughing all that high octane scenes which comes jiff performance is only good thing about this movie shahid kapoor as tommy singh is just adorable way he keeps his jaw dropped intrigue sparkle his eyes above note body language are just too good he has carried this character fantastic way alia bhatt as bihari laborer is first rate she gets one performance oriented scene she does awesome her looks body language is impeccable yes she speaks dialogues which are meant be serious but few times it evokes laughter kareena kapoor khan diljit dosanjh are just ok due lack good scenes them,0.47866013071895436,0.11562091503267975,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.35}"
