10.0,Another intelligent and incisive look at the gangster life from Ram Gopal Varma,"Ram Gopal Varma's SATYA is one of my very favourite Hindi movies, though rather an anomaly in the Hindi movies that I've seen. Much darker in tone than Bollywood usually offers, it's also one of the most intelligent movies about gangsters ever made in my opinion. RGV returns to similar themes with his latest movie, Company, but this time brings a whole new style to his direction that makes the movie stand out even more from the Bollywood crowd. The movie still has a grittiness and realism in its examination of the underworld, but this time it is filtered through post-MTV-post-Wong Kar-Wai sensibilities. I've always found Indian movies to have some of the best cinematography in the world, but never seen one that looks like this. Wide angle lenses, cameras half obscured behind the scenery, bright contrast, quick fire staccato editing... all very modern cinematic tricks, and very well done here.The Company is in fact an organised crime syndicate, which our hero Chandu (Vivek Oberoi) joins at the start of the film. Chandu is the young leader of a small time gang looking to make it big. He earns the respect and trust of company head Malik and quickly rises to be his right hand man. When Malik makes a bid for power, the two of them have to handle the fallout from the quakes it makes through the criminal infrastructure.Chandu is a similar character to Satya (who is one of my favourite movie characters, and not just because he has the best beard in film), but a leaner meaner more ambitious kind of career criminal. Nowhere near as mean or as hardened as the seemingly imperturbable Malik, however. Malik takes his business very seriously.The rise to power of a young gangster is a theme that has been handled on many occasions before, and Company is not vastly different to its predecessors... although it is a good reminder of what hopelessly romanticised popcorn fodder the YOUNG & DANGEROUS series are. With almost no song and dance routines, the run time is kept down to a lean 145 minutes, but this is still plenty of time to build and explore the characters and their situations very thoroughly. Company is quite a subtle movie, the pacing not too hurried and the situations mostly underplayed. This, coupled with the depth of the script and the very stylish camerawork and editing, gives the movie a very sharp feel. Another intelligent movie about gangsters, and an unmistakably cool one too.Sadly, the movie is let down terribly on one front - the soundtrack. Not all the time, but quite often the music is conspicuously inappropriate. Most irritating is the over use of Mussorgski's Night On Bear Mountain at completely the wrong times, but there are other problems too.Ultimately, I don't think I enjoyed COMPANY quite as much as I enjoyed SATYA. Perhaps this is because this time my expectation and anticipation was higher, but mostly I think it's that Chandu isn't as sympathetic a character as Satya was. Oberoi plays the character quite well, with mountains of cool but a certain amount of depth... but he doesn't command the screen in the same way that J.D. Chakravarti did. This is probably because his beard isn't as cool.I did enjoy the movie a lot though... the 2.5 hours pretty much flew by, and the script kept me interested all the way through, never becoming too predictable. There aren't a whole lot of laughs in the movie, or even smiles... this isn't the kind of gangster movie that has you rooting for the heroes as they gun down armies of cops (which, incidentally, the heroes here never do... the violence is mostly contained within the criminal underworld). It's a movie that explores what it really means to be a gangster, and the position of crime and criminals within society. Chandu and Malik are certainly presented as the 'heroes' of the movie, but it never glosses over what they actually have to do to get their power.India is a poor country, and it's a fact that a lot of the movies produced in Mumbai are targetted at an audience with a pretty low literacy rate. Bollywood movies don't tend to be too challenging to watch, or if they do wish to explore a more serious point it is usually done with very little subtlety. I am curious as to how successful Ram Gopal Varma is in India, as the two movies of his that I've seen have been challenging in a very subtle way. He's obviously quite a box office draw as Company is clearly a big budget production. Filming 2.5 hours of that kind of camerawork/editing isn't an overnight task, and extensive sections of the film are shot on location in Hong Kong, Africa and... Switzerland I think. Well, I have no doubt that enough of the Indian population are perfectly well educated and will have no problem appreciating the finer points of the movie - but I imagine that the overseas market must have been in his sights as well.Company is a movie that I'd like to see get pushed in the US, as it's a nice reminder that the TRAFFICs and co of the world are not exclusive Hollywood property. Sadly, American studios have frequently demonstrated that its not in their interest to promote this fact, so I expect it will be left with this semi-decent DVD release and word of mouth to spread itself around. My word of mouth is a strong recommendation that people seek that DVD out.",another intelligent incisive look at gangster life ram gopal varma,ram gopal varmas satya is one my very favourite hindi movies though rather anomaly hindi movies that ive seen much darker tone than bollywood usually offers its also one most intelligent movies about gangsters ever made my opinion rgv returns similar themes with his latest movie company but this time brings whole new style his direction that makes movie stand out even more bollywood crowd movie still has grittiness realism its examination underworld but this time it is filtered through post mtv post wong kar wai sensibilities ive always found indian movies have some best cinematography world but never seen one that looks like this wide angle lenses cameras half obscured behind scenery bright contrast quick fire staccato editing all very modern cinematic tricks very well done here company is fact organised crime syndicate which our hero chandu vivek oberoi joins at start film chandu is young leader small time gang looking make it big he earns respect trust company head malik quickly rises be his right hand man when malik makes bid power two them have handle fallout quakes it makes through criminal infrastructure chandu is similar character satya who is one my favourite movie characters not just because he has best beard film but leaner meaner more ambitious kind career criminal nowhere near as mean or as hardened as seemingly imperturbable malik however malik takes his business very seriously rise power young gangster is theme that has been handled many occasions before company is not vastly different its predecessors although it is good reminder what hopelessly romanticised popcorn fodder young dangerous series are with almost no song dance routines run time is kept down lean 145 minutes but this is still plenty time build explore characters their situations very thoroughly company is quite subtle movie pacing not too hurried situations mostly underplayed this coupled with depth script very stylish camerawork editing gives movie very sharp feel another intelligent movie about gangsters unmistakably cool one too sadly movie is let down terribly one front soundtrack not all time but quite often music is conspicuously inappropriate most irritating is over use mussorgskis night bear mountain at completely wrong times but there are other problems too ultimately i dont think i enjoyed company quite as much as i enjoyed satya perhaps this is because this time my expectation anticipation was higher but mostly i think its that chandu isnt as sympathetic character as satya was oberoi plays character quite well with mountains cool but certain amount depth but he doesnt command screen same way that j d chakravarti did this is probably because his beard isnt as cool i did enjoy movie lot though 2 5 hours pretty much flew by script kept me interested all way through never becoming too predictable there arent whole lot laughs movie or even smiles this isnt kind gangster movie that has you rooting heroes as they gun down armies cops which incidentally heroes here never do violence is mostly contained within criminal underworld its movie that explores what it really means be gangster position crime criminals within society chandu malik are certainly presented as heroes movie but it never glosses over what they actually have do get their power india is poor country its fact that lot movies produced mumbai are targetted at audience with pretty low literacy rate bollywood movies dont tend be too challenging watch or if they do wish explore more serious point it is usually done with very little subtlety i am curious as how successful ram gopal varma is india as two movies his that ive seen have been challenging very subtle way hes obviously quite box office draw as company is clearly big budget production filming 2 5 hours that kind camerawork editing isnt overnight task extensive sections film are shot location hong kong africa switzerland i think well i have no doubt that enough indian population are perfectly well educated will have no problem appreciating finer points movie but i imagine that overseas market must have been his sights as well company is movie that id like see get pushed us as its nice reminder that traffics co world are not exclusive hollywood property sadly american studios have frequently demonstrated that its not their interest promote this fact so i expect it will be left with this semi decent dvd release word mouth spread itself around my word mouth is strong recommendation that people seek that dvd out,0.5623617007992008,0.15617210914085908,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,Wow!,"Ram Gopal Varma's latest offering 'Company' is probably one of the best Indian gangster films ever made (after Nayakan and Satya). This film is so well done that the viewers feel like they are watching real-life events. And people living in India will know that some of the events are actually inspired by real-life incidents, although the film does not admit it. Company is the story of two friends - Malik (Ajay Devgan) and Chandu (Vivek Oberoi) - how they build up the 'Company' - Bombay underworld on a global scale and thus establish their supremacy. A small misunderstanding between them turns into a large scale mafia war. The cast in this film is great, a special mention must be made of Vivek Oberoi. The son of Suresh Oberoi (former Bollywood star) is talented and seems to have put in a lot of effort for his first film. I only hope he doesn't get type-casted in the future after such a hard-hitting role on debut. Ajay Devgan fits very well into the role of Malik, a cold blooded don who always means business. Manisha Koirala enacts the role of Malik's girlfriend pretty well and is refreshing. However, the biggest surprise of this film was Antara Mali. She has done a great job as Chandu's wife, and it only goes to show that there is no dearth of talent in the country.The narrative is well paced, and the viewer never gets bored. Some people might find the absence of songs in the film annoying, but their presence would only hamper the pace of the film. The script is well written, and some of the dialogues are really memorable - for example, when Malik says ""To forgive a friend's mistake is an even bigger mistake in the 'Company'"". The background music by Sandeep Chowta really complements the plot and he certainly deserves some credit. But more than anything, it is Ram Gopal Varma's direction that needs to be appreciated. He has proved once again that with a good story, an excellent cast and a lot of determination, one can make a memorable film and defy some of Bollywood's age old norms. A special mention must also be made of Mohanlal. He is certainly one of the best Indian actors of all time and although his Hindi dialogue-delivery in Company is quite sloppy, he deserves a lot of praise for making a good effort. His portrayal of an honest, determined cop trying to eradicate crime in Bombay (loosely based on Sivanandan, Joint Commissioner of Police, Mumbai) is very well executed.The film gives us an in-depth view into the dark world of Bombay Mafia, where only the fittest survive, and how their operations have spread on a global scale. One thing I found intriguing about this film was the role that mobile phones play, how everything can be controlled efficiently by just making one phone call, and how business deals and murders can be executed with, quite literally, just one push of a button.Bottomline: This film is a must-watch. A landmark in Indian film-making, all thanks to Ram Gopal Varma.

,"realistic, slick, gritty, stylish, dark, frightening...it all stinks but it's business!","'Company' opens with Malik's haunting introductory monologue about the underworld and this is followed by Urmila Matondkar's bloodthirsty sadistic number, the tune of which will echo throughout the film. The song sequence itself, 'Aaja re Mere Gale Lag ja' describes the underworld. 'Company' ranks among one of Ram Gopal Verma's best and one of the best crime films of Indian cinema. A fellow commenter has wonderfully made comparisons with Shakespeare's King Lear. Sahni's writing is of high quality and it just keeps one's eyes glued towards the screen.There are several words that can describe the film-making. A few that pop up include: realism, slick, gritty, stylish without being over the top, and fine editing. Cinematography deserves special mention as the camera acts as an eye. Use of lighting is remarkable as this gives the city and crime-world a darkly raw look and use of sound effects e.g. the ringing mobile phones is skillfully done.The songs are thankfully relegated to the background except for one, 'Khallas'. All the songs add to the narration and 'Khallas' is a situational song that takes place in a nightclub, the lyrics of which cleverly describe the events.Verma also displays the relationships between the characters in a very concise manner. Even though, the main focus is the relationship between Chandu and Malik, with just a few scenes who shows us the significance of the connections between the other characters. For example, just that one scene where Saroja is in bed telling Malik about her mother's wish for them to get married is enough of an indication of their bond.Ajay Devgan formidably underplays his part. He could safely add 'Company' at the top of his list of achievements. Vivek Oberoi delivers a knockout debut performance. The actor has shown tremendous potential and like Devgan, he too can add this to the top of his list. Mohanlal is adequate. However, I don't quite understand this respect he has for Malik. The guy's a cold-blooded killer (well he has other's to do the dirty work) and Sreenivasan is shown as a good cop so what's the basis of this mutual respect? Manisha Koirala again does what she's best at doing. She gives a subtle but enigmatic performance. Seema Biswas is likable and she naturally gets under the skin of her part. Antara Mali is mind-blowing, and like the men, she too can include 'Company' at the top of her list.Finally, 'Company' is Verma's masterpiece. He's the one who brought it all together to make the film and tell the dark story of the underworld.

,an achieved gangster movie by Ram Gopal Varma,"Where Satya was moving but not very original, Company mixes HK, US and indian influences to look like something unique. The dancing scenes are better integrated than in Satya, the movie is short for an indian movie but more efficient, the story is well written although the idea of mafia as a business has been seen many times, acting is wonderful. But the best thing here is Varma's masterful visual style combining a dirty photography, an editing influenced by Hong Kong cinema, a documentary like visual style to create his own unique style and giving the movie a hot, heavy, dark, dirty atmosphere.

The film was allegedly based on Dawood Ibrahim and Chota Rajan Split The film shows us the lives of gangsters and how people get sucked in the underworld.The film doesn't have big locales, huge canvas, songs and dances like YRF and KJ but it's a slice of life film something RGV excelled in those daysThe film's first half is easygoing and quite slow, but several scenes make a mark like the scene when Ajay- Madan Joshi and Ajay's rivals clash where Ajay sides Vivek, even the prior scene in the police station and the subsequent shoot out in the car is awesomeThe scene where Ajay Devgan's gang shoots Vivek's friend is also brilliant, There is lot of build up and the viewer is swept into the life of Chandu and Malik, even the love stories are kept less filmy and gel well with the film, Thankfully barring KHALAAS no sudden song.dance or item song or even comedy.The clash scene is brilliant and the film moves in a twisted format, just when you expect something to happen there comes a twist and till the end it keeps you guessingThere are several brilliant scenes like Vivek shooting Akash Khurana, Vivek getting Injured, Mohanlal confronting Vivek, Antra picking the gun to shoot Ajay and the climax where suddenly the inevitable happens RGV made a prequel to this film and called it D(2005) but it failed Direction by RGV is top class, he handles the genre superbly like a pro Music by Sandeep Chowta is kept to minimum, KHALAAS is superb and became a rage thouigh the placement distracts, TUMSE KITNA PYAAR is awesome tooCamera-work is superbAjay Devgan enacts his character like second skin, In fact the role suits him perfectly, and his every dialogue, every expression leaves a huge mark, He suits the best for such roles and no one can play it better then him Vivek Oberoi in his debut did a good job handling the character which was very unconventional for a debut, and he did a great job though at times tries too hard, sadly his career fell short due to some mistakes later Manisha Koirala does a good job in her role and looks good while Antra Mali gives one of her best performance Ganesh Yadav is good, Vijay Raaz leaves a mark Akash Khurana, Madan Joshi, Bharat Dabolkar are all good Rajpal Yadav gets no scope Seema Biswas is awesome",one best gangster films,rgv after making shiva satya came back with another gangster film companythe film which is still today talked about its unique take gangsters peep into their lives film was allegedly based dawood ibrahim chota rajan split film shows us lives gangsters how people get sucked underworld film doesnt have big locales huge canvas songs dances like yrf kj but its slice life film something rgv excelled those daysthe films first half is easygoing quite slow but several scenes make mark like scene when ajay madan joshi ajays rivals clash where ajay sides vivek even prior scene police station subsequent shoot out car is awesomethe scene where ajay devgans gang shoots viveks friend is also brilliant there is lot build up viewer is swept into life chandu malik even love stories are kept less filmy gel well with film thankfully barring khalaas no sudden song dance or item song or even comedy clash scene is brilliant film moves twisted format just when you expect something happen there comes twist till end it keeps you guessingthere are several brilliant scenes like vivek shooting akash khurana vivek getting injured mohanlal confronting vivek antra picking gun shoot ajay climax where suddenly inevitable happens rgv made prequel this film called it d 2005 but it failed direction by rgv is top class he handles genre superbly like pro music by sandeep chowta is kept minimum khalaas is superb became rage thouigh placement distracts tumse kitna pyaar is awesome toocamera work is superbajay devgan enacts his character like second skin fact role suits him perfectly his every dialogue every expression leaves huge mark he suits best such roles no one can play it better then him vivek oberoi his debut did good job handling character which was very unconventional debut he did great job though at times tries too hard sadly his career fell short due some mistakes later manisha koirala does good job her role looks good while antra mali gives one her best performance ganesh yadav is good vijay raaz leaves mark akash khurana madan joshi bharat dabolkar are all good rajpal yadav gets no scope seema biswas is awesome,0.520921985815603,0.32712765957446804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.24}"
,"Dark, insightful and engrossing.","Company is a very taut, very dark look at the ruthlessness with which the Mumbai underworld syndicates operate, and the games people play when their only motivations are greed, power-lust and more than a little pride. It focuses on how important inter-personal relationships are to the success of any business venture (here, the venture happens to be organised crime), and how the fraying of such relationships can be used effectively by law-enforcement agencies to bust gangs like the Company of the title.Performances: spot on. Ajay Devgan is chilling yet wonderfully controlled in one of the two leading roles, and Vivek Oberoi's intensity in his role as the violent, ruthless yet eventually human underling is riveting. The women's roles are small but well-written and well-performed; all three - Antara Mali, Manisha Koirala, and Seema Biswas - do a good job. Mohanlal is also excellent, and I actually thought his Malayalam-accented Hindi was perfect for the role. At times, watching Company was like watching a particularly well-crafted documentary. I love the way Ram Gopal Verma depicts Mumbai in all its raw, hustling energy. The locations all seemed very real, as did the situations, characters and dialogue (which was realistic and street-smart without being particularly profane, which I think was quite an achievement). I also liked the fact that the voiceover was in the same slightly edgy dialect of Mumbaiyya Hindi, so that one felt like the speaker was a part of the same world as the protagonists. My only problem with the film was that I found Chowta's background score over-loud and often jarring in its attempt to build up mood when the director was doing so very successfully anyway, leading to it seeming redundant and sometimes irritating. There were moments when it overshadowed the dialogue, and this was really annoying. Over-emphasis is something this film could have done without, and it is this that holds me back from calling Company a total triumph. Pity. Khallas is a great song, though. :-)Interestingly, the film manages to combine esentially amoral characters with an eventual denouement that drives home a moral message (very subtly, though). I'm not sure where I stand on this, I tend to see the 'good guys win eventually' message as something of a cop-out to the conventions of Hindi cinema. Nonetheless, if this makes the film more palatable to mainstream audiences, so be it. I'm particularly interested to see how a film like this, which for all intents and purposes pushes the boundaries of 'Bollywood' film-making in a totally new direction with its absence of conventional songs, extremely moody lighting, heroes who really aren't that heroic, realism in dialogue, characterisation and setting, and very flashy, almost MTV-like editing, (all things that have been tried in the last two years in several Hindi films, but not together and not with so much skill)does at the Indian box office. If it succeeds, then it proves that the success (however limited) of Satya, Chandni Bar, Lagaan and Dil Chahta Hai, which in their own way moved Hindi cinema away from the formula, was not a flash in the pan, and will hopefully inspire more experimentation. What's certain is that with this film Verma has proven that he is perhaps the most innovative mainstream film-maker in India today, and I await more films from him with interest. He seems to be getting better with every film. Overall, a must-watch, especially if you like the gangster/noir genre.",dark insightful engrossing,company is very taut very dark look at ruthlessness with which mumbai underworld syndicates operate games people play when their only motivations are greed power lust more than little pride it focuses how important inter personal relationships are success any business venture here venture happens be organised crime how fraying such relationships can be used effectively by law enforcement agencies bust gangs like company title performances spot ajay devgan is chilling yet wonderfully controlled one two leading roles vivek oberois intensity his role as violent ruthless yet eventually human underling is riveting womens roles are small but well written well performed all three antara mali manisha koirala seema biswas do good job mohanlal is also excellent i actually thought his malayalam accented hindi was perfect role at times watching company was like watching particularly well crafted documentary i love way ram gopal verma depicts mumbai all its raw hustling energy locations all seemed very real as did situations characters dialogue which was realistic street smart without being particularly profane which i think was quite achievement i also liked fact that voiceover was same slightly edgy dialect mumbaiyya hindi so that one felt like speaker was part same world as protagonists my only problem with film was that i found chowtas background score over loud often jarring its attempt build up mood when director was doing so very successfully anyway leading it seeming redundant sometimes irritating there were moments when it overshadowed dialogue this was really annoying over emphasis is something this film could have done without it is this that holds me back calling company total triumph pity khallas is great song though interestingly film manages combine esentially amoral characters with eventual denouement that drives home moral message very subtly though im not sure where i stand this i tend see good guys win eventually message as something cop out conventions hindi cinema nonetheless if this makes film more palatable mainstream audiences so be it im particularly interested see how film like this which all intents purposes pushes boundaries bollywood film making totally new direction with its absence conventional songs extremely moody lighting heroes who really arent that heroic realism dialogue characterisation setting very flashy almost mtv like editing all things that have been tried last two years several hindi films but not together not with so much skill does at indian box office if it succeeds then it proves that success however limited satya chandni bar lagaan dil chahta hai which their own way moved hindi cinema away formula was not flash pan will hopefully inspire more experimentation whats certain is that with this film verma has proven that he is perhaps most innovative mainstream film maker india today i await more films him with interest he seems be getting better with every film overall must watch especially if you like gangster noir genre,0.5242884892884894,0.16515193140193135,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.31}"

8.0,Indian version of Goodfellas!,"Company has become one of Indias first cult films. The film did average business at the box office, but found a larger audience on dvd and video due to good word of mouth.SPOILER ALERT I likened the film to an Indianized, (not copied) version of Goodfellas. The rise and fall of the small time hoodlum, under the watchful guise of an underworld don, is similar to the relationship shared by Ray Liotta and Robert DeNiro in Goodfellas.This is Vivek Oberois first film, and he gives a mind shattering performance as Chandu, the gangster in training. It is hard to believe that such a performance was extracted from the newcomer. He holds his own over the veteran, Ajay Devgan, who plays the underworld don.The story gets very interesting post interval when Oberoi and Devgans characters have a difference of opinion and embark on an international campagn to kill one another.I loved the fact that the film was shot in 3 to 4 different countries. Hong Kong and Kenya were used a actual backdrops to excel the storyline rather than pituresque locations to film songs.Company is a hard hitting drama that has not been seen in Indian cinema for quite awile.

Hence, the name Company!!The film starts with a panoramic shot of Mumbai with a hawk flying around the space. It sets the tone for the racy underworld saga which unfolds... RGV touches upon the gangster- cop nexus as well as its influence on film industry so common in those times. We have a Sanjay Dutt type character called in for questioning for his candid (!!) phone conversations with underworld elements. The 'Khallas' item number is still memorable for Isha Koppikar's rain soaked jhatkas!!Of the cast, Ajay Devgn is outstanding as the don with droopy eyes and a sinister mind. Vivek Oberoi was brilliant in his debut role as the hot headed Chandu. It was difficult to believe this was his first film. Manisha Koirala left a mark in a small role.
