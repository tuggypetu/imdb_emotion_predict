8.0,"The entire movie feels like it is building up to a worthwhile and tremendous climax that the film never hits; but conceptually, this is brilliant","Crimes of the Future (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a future where surgery and pain is the new sex. In the future they don't feel pain so they push the limits of the human body. They've gone so far in their experiments the human body has begun to evolve in new ways science has never seen and the government wishes to hide from society. Underground observations has become the rage to whiteness surgeries that explore the human body and its evolution.This movie is directed by David Cronenberg (Dead Ringers) and stars Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), Kristen Stewart (Twilight), Léa Seydoux (Spectre), Scott Speedman (Underworld) and Welket Bungué (Upheavel).The storyline, settings l, cinematography and circumstances of this picture are wildly original, unique and well done. The special effects are first rate with fantastic surgery scenes and gore. The characters are mysterious and unpredictable and there are tremendous plots and subplots in this film. My only complaint is the entire movie feels like it is building up to a worthwhile and tremendous climax that the film never hits; but conceptually, this is brilliant.Overall this is a movie that fails to reach its full potential but is wildly entertaining and an absolutely must see. I would score this a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",entire movie feels like it is building up worthwhile tremendous climax that film never hits but conceptually this is brilliant,crimes future 2022 is movie my wife i saw theatres last night storyline follows future where surgery pain is new sex future they dont feel pain so they push limits human body theyve gone so far their experiments human body has begun evolve new ways science has never seen government wishes hide society underground observations has become rage whiteness surgeries that explore human body its evolution this movie is directed by david cronenberg dead ringers stars viggo mortensen lord rings kristen stewart twilight l seydoux spectre scott speedman underworld welket bungu upheavel storyline settings l cinematography circumstances this picture are wildly original unique well done special effects are first rate with fantastic surgery scenes gore characters are mysterious unpredictable there are tremendous plots subplots this film my only complaint is entire movie feels like it is building up worthwhile tremendous climax that film never hits but conceptually this is brilliant overall this is movie that fails reach its full potential but is wildly entertaining absolutely must see i would score this 7 5 10 strongly recommend it,0.5899681337181337,0.17351491101491104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.47}"
,Dark horror sci-fi in Cronenberg's usually entertaining take on the dynamic of humanity and technology.,"""Surgery is the new sex."" Caprice (Lea Seydoux)Although I have a less sensual feeling about surgery than Caprice, David Cronenberg in his new Crimes of the Future makes the case for the tyranny of cosmetic and internal organ rehab for the human body. ""Body horror"" is the name of his game. He is so good at observing the close relationship between technology and the body that this horror cum philosophy disturber gets attention and doesn't let go. And sometimes it makes sense.At a science fiction future time, humans are growing synthetic organs and messing around with plastic surgery so that the parallel with the contemporary urge for surgery is unavoidable. The blight of plastic in our environment is brought home when a boy chomps on a plastic basket.The main performance artist, Saul (Vigo Mortenson), has become a rock star of synthetic organs reminiscent of Kafka's troubled Hunger Artist. Garbed sometimes like Death in Bergman's Seventh Seal, Saul publicly showcases the metamorphosis of his organs in performances catering to a jaded humanity.As his assistant and surgeon, Caprice operates on and models his new organs resulting from his ""designer cancer."" As for the two actually having old-fashioned sex, I'm not so sure but am wary of the future population decline, as the Chinese have experienced.Another female who works for the director's symbolic machine is Timlin (Kristen Stewart), under the employ of The National Organ Registry (ominous title with malevolent bureaucratic properties) and desirous of connecting with Saul's celebrity. Like other citizens, she is seeking sensation as a byproduct of pain deficiency and dull affect. When she unzips his stomach zipper and licks his wounds, echoes of the old oral sex intrude.Enough said of the organ motif, for more organic to Crimes of the Future is the human evolution to dangerous surgery and questionable cosmetics, a world almost devoid of humanity and full of narcissism. While it is a world devoid of pain, it's the interior emotions that seem, like the synthetic organs, vulnerable. The ""inner beauty pageant"" is the one salutary oddity contrasted with the ugly organ expos.Crimes of the Future is easier to stomach, so to speak, than would be suspected. There's almost a Zen acceptance of the evolution that stands somewhere between The Fly and Crash, highly symbolic and slightly hopeful about humanity's survival, but accepting that crimes are always in our future.",dark horror sci fi cronenbergs usually entertaining take dynamic humanity technology,surgery is new sex caprice lea seydoux although i have less sensual feeling about surgery than caprice david cronenberg his new crimes future makes case tyranny cosmetic internal organ rehab human body body horror is name his game he is so good at observing close relationship between technology body that this horror cum philosophy disturber gets attention doesnt let go sometimes it makes sense at science fiction future time humans are growing synthetic organs messing around with plastic surgery so that parallel with contemporary urge surgery is unavoidable blight plastic our environment is brought home when boy chomps plastic basket main performance artist saul vigo mortenson has become rock star synthetic organs reminiscent kafkas troubled hunger artist garbed sometimes like death bergmans seventh seal saul publicly showcases metamorphosis his organs performances catering jaded humanity as his assistant surgeon caprice operates models his new organs resulting his designer cancer as two actually having old fashioned sex im not so sure but am wary future population decline as chinese have experienced another female who works directors symbolic machine is timlin kristen stewart under employ national organ registry ominous title with malevolent bureaucratic properties desirous connecting with sauls celebrity like other citizens she is seeking sensation as byproduct pain deficiency dull affect when she unzips his stomach zipper licks his wounds echoes old oral sex intrude enough said organ motif more organic crimes future is human evolution dangerous surgery questionable cosmetics world almost devoid humanity full narcissism while it is world devoid pain its interior emotions that seem like synthetic organs vulnerable inner beauty pageant is one salutary oddity contrasted with ugly organ expos crimes future is easier stomach so speak than would be suspected theres almost zen acceptance evolution that stands somewhere between fly crash highly symbolic slightly hopeful about humanitys survival but accepting that crimes are always our future,0.39307344276094264,-0.00724116161616161,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.41}"
8.0,Unexpected body horror,"I mainly wanted to see cause I love David Cronenberg's films, I barely knew much and I fairly enjoyed Crimes of the Future. The ambient music is one of my favorite aspects, I really like weird movies and the acting is great! Reminds me of Pathology but much weirder. I talked to one guy in the audience for a bit before the movie started he seemed cool I was surprised he left halfway in, it's not a bad movie at all. An interesting surgery story with some not so appealing eating; I would recommend the movie to anyone that would be interested.",unexpected body horror,i mainly wanted see cause i love david cronenbergs films i barely knew much i fairly enjoyed crimes future ambient music is one my favorite aspects i really like weird movies acting is great reminds me pathology but much weirder i talked one guy audience bit before movie started he seemed cool i was surprised he left halfway its not bad movie at all interesting surgery story with some not so appealing eating i would recommend movie anyone that would be interested,0.511842105263158,0.24035087719298245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.53, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.18}"
6.0,The future of art....,"65/100My expectations for the film were completely off. The trailer made me think that the film was going to be one way, but turned out it was the opposite.While it wasn't as I expected it was still a decent film. It was artistic, dark, twisted, and intriguing. The story had an interesting concept. ""Surgery is the new sex"". With that in my mind now it really opens a new visual to the film.The performance was very well done. It's been awhile since I've seen Viggo Mortensen in a film. He was excellent and I enjoyed his performance. Having only seen Léa Seydoux in ""James Bond"" previously, I thought she did an excellent job as well opposite Viggo. Continuing with the acting performances, this is perhaps the first film that I enjoyed Kristen Stewart's performance. Just her shyness and dark persona made her likeable.The film does lose a lot interest because it becomes too slow at times and drags on more than it needs to a certain moments. While a slower pace is key to the film it's just too slow.Overall, there is some good intriguing moments to the film that I struggle to convey into words. A twisted art story involving slicing and dicing the body. Honestly, it was worth seeing in theatres, but I would've preferred to see it on a cheap night.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you a little in making a decision. Until next time....

8.0,"A small but wonderful taste of a bizarre, fascinating future","One need not have seen all of David Cronenberg's films to quickly come to understand that consistent themes course through his most imaginative works. Body, mind, sex, and transformation are the core tenants of what Cronenberg does best. And these are integral to everything 2022's 'Crimes of the future' represents. I admit it's not quite what I thought it would be: not by way of quality, necessarily, but just in terms of how the content is structured. There is definite narrative here, yet it seems deemphasized, almost as though it's a distinctly secondary priority. This is accentuated by how some plot points are not fully realized, whether they're revealed with muddied clarity, or developed with a haphazard feel. More important here is the grand vision - the stitching together of a strange, tantalizing world, and all its moving parts. More than the concrete story, 'Crimes of the future' is built on presenting pockets of a new reality, and sewing them onto the canvas of the whole. It is, at varying points, engrossing, perplexing, stimulating, and or simply brilliant. It is absolutely not going to appeal to all viewers - but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a smile on my face throughout the whole length.It's not an outright flaw, but I will say I would personally have preferred a bit more attentiveness in the narrative writing. If the story is in fact complete and cohesive (and I'm not 100% sure it is), it doesn't always come across that way. Storytelling can make or break a title, and while that facet is (sufficiently) successful in this instance, the picture would have certainly benefited from tighter writing in that regard. I'd go so far as to say that the major critique that pops out at me about 'Crimes of the future' is that it just doesn't quite feel like Enough. Most of the jarring imagery we'd anticipate from a Cronenberg picture was shown to us in the first teaser trailer, and while we do get more detail to expand our in-universe knowledge, one almost gets a sense of having gotten only a sample, and not a full serving. By the same token, time that could have been spent exhibiting more of Saul Tenser's world is instead used to advance that narrative that to one degree or another seems unpolished, and even unfinished. The concepts are enticing, and the movie leaves us wanting much, much more - which is certainly to the filmmaker's credit, save for that I also feel like 'Crimes of the future' itself could have been more.On the other hand, otherwise Cronenberg's screenplay is fantastic, with complex and varied characters and rich, absorbing scene writing especially standing out. In fact, the latter may be the most crucial aspect of the entire production, as it informs the details that go into the story and the world-building. The future seen here is one that has been ruined by human mismanagement (all too real), but also one in which human culture and basic physiology has begun to shift. Those shifts are plainly unsettling as they present, yet anxious gut reactions are overshadowed by reason as the greatest extremes are indicated to be wholly willful, voluntary, and consensual - and by horror, not at pointedly grotesque displays, but at the parallels of steps the fictional government takes to curtail harmless private activities, or even progress that could be of genuine common good. The scene writing shows us glimpses of all these elements - culture, biology, technology, government, social relationships - and in so doing remains suitably diverse as to never lag or drag. It's a swirling, dazzling fancy that Cronenberg has put before us, and again I can only lament that we're not given still more.Beyond the writing, 'Crimes of the future' is impeccable. Cronenberg's direction - his eye for shot composition, and his guiding hand in instructing his cast and orchestrating scenes - remains as untarnished today as it it did in the 70s. Though lighting and cinematography lean into the dim, dark spaces, these are nonetheless lush and vibrant in their own right, making this film easy on the eyes, and pleasant. The costume design, hair and makeup work, blood and gore, and prosthetics are outstanding, as are the props and larger set pieces - veritable works of art, very well designed and crafted, and making this grim yet mesmerizing future setting feel all the more real. This is to say nothing of set design and decoration, filming locations - honestly, everything about the art direction and production design are terrific, and I love every bit of it. One would be remiss not to also highlight the original score of composer extraordinaire Howard Shore. Never taking the foreground, his themes are nonetheless an important part of the feature, lending much to the mood of any given scene and enriching the experience.Forgive my loquacity, but add to this a retinue of great performances. None are so grabbing as to demand lavish praise, yet everyone on hand excels in embodying their characters and bringing them to life, all carrying marvelous nuance, range, and physicality. Of course Viggo Mortensen stands out most of all, portraying complicated protagonist Saul with such a strong air of chronic pain and discomfort that one almost feels concern for Mortensen himself. Léa Seydoux is a joy, imbuing Caprice with a strength and personality that frankly exceeds the requirements of the role. Even in only small supporting parts, Don McKellar and Kristen Stewart impress in giving Wippet a notable nervous excitability - and Timlin, an even more striking mousy disposition that belies deep, stirring emotions.It would be easy enough to continue to pour over every last iota of the picture, but short of discussing specific plot points, the essence remains the same. 'Crimes of the future' reflects Cronenberg returning to the most wild recesses of his imagination, revisiting those themes and genre elements that have done so much to make his a recognizable name in horror circles. The spectacle to greet us is captivating, and the story intriguing, with a slight neo-noir sensibility to the scenario and characters - yet surprisingly, and perhaps disappointingly, a shade understated, and restrained. The furthest reaches of what the film could have been is not necessarily what we get - enough to give a taste of superb, flavorful ideas, but maybe not enough to totally satisfy. Still, even at that, even if the end result leaves me marginally discontented, much more so than not 'Crimes of the future' is an inventive, thought-provoking, bewitching, and entertaining cinematic experience. It may take a second view to pick up on some subtleties I hadn't discerned before, and more to the point, I'd like to see it again - and perhaps that says as much as anything could.",small but

8.0,"More thought-provoking than disturbing, but a solid watch regardless","After eight years, Cronenberg is finally back with the simple premise: what if humans could no longer feel pain? And, for the most part, he's able to expand on this idea to create one of his most interesting features, and a very welcome return to cinema. It's certainly a movie to avoid if you want something flat-out scary, but if you're looking for something more idea-driven, this could be a great watch.Normally, Cronenberg films can be divided into two distinct types: the spectacle-driven horror movies (Videodrome, Naked Lunch) and the ideological social dramas (A History of Violence, Eastern Promises). For a while they just existed as two very different phases of his career, miles apart in both tone and theme. But with Maps to the Stars, his previous film, Cronenberg created a bold and memorable mix of them: one moment is a disturbing encounter with a ghost, the next is social commentary on Hollywood celebrities.This trend continues in Crimes of the Future to an even more extreme degree, with disgusting body mutilations and musings on the nature of evolution existing side-by-side. It's one of his most intellectual features, deftly exploring the fascinating world he has created and letting the audience mull over its implications.The clinical direction and cinematography can understandably be off-putting to some people. But it helps create a sterile, almost casual atmosphere, one that does a good job of conveying the future's lack of emotional attachment to the human body. It's no longer a remarkable work of nature, but merely a blank slate that's to be molded however you wish.A movie like this can really fall apart if the acting's not up to par, but luckily the cast is uniformly great. They're all more than capable of selling this idea of a post-pain world in which humans rip out and mangle their own organs in front of entranced onlookers. Kristen Stewart has the most difficult job of everyone (for reasons that are too intriguing to spoil), and she absolutely nails it. She's awkward, funny, and disturbing in equal proportions. Although it is disappointing that she's somewhat underused in the movie, what little screen time she has is very effective.Is Crimes of the Future a perfect movie? Definitely not. It's overly indulgent at points, some of the supporting characters don't have a lot to do, and its message about humanity and technology doesn't have the resonance it should. But ultimately, the film accomplishes nearly everything it strives for: it's gross, psychologically stimulating, restrained in all the right ways, and a thoroughly satisfying film overall. I'm thrilled to see what Cronenberg does next.Final Score: 77/100.",more thought provoking than disturbing but solid watch regardless,after eight years cronenberg is finally back with simple premise what if humans could no longer feel pain most part hes able expand this idea create one his most interesting features very welcome return cinema its certainly movie avoid if you want something flat out scary but if youre looking something more idea driven this could be great watch normally cronenberg films can be divided into two distinct types spectacle driven horror movies videodrome naked lunch ideological social dramas history violence eastern promises while they just existed as two very different phases his career miles apart both tone theme but with maps stars his previous film cronenberg created bold memorable mix them one moment is disturbing encounter with ghost next is social commentary hollywood celebrities this trend continues crimes future even more extreme degree with disgusting body mutilations musings nature evolution existing side by side its one his most intellectual features deftly exploring fascinating world he has created letting audience mull over its implications clinical direction cinematography can understandably be off putting some people but it helps create sterile almost casual atmosphere one that does good job conveying futures lack emotional attachment human body its no longer remarkable work nature but merely blank slate thats be molded however you wish movie like this can really fall apart if actings not up par but luckily cast is uniformly great theyre all more than capable selling this idea post pain world which humans rip out mangle their own organs front entranced onlookers kristen stewart has most difficult job everyone reasons that are too intriguing spoil she absolutely nails it shes awkward funny disturbing equal proportions although it is disappointing that shes somewhat underused movie what little screen time she has is very effective is crimes future perfect movie definitely not its overly indulgent at points some supporting characters dont have lot do its message about humanity technology doesnt have resonance it should but ultimately film accomplishes nearly everything it strives its gross psychologically stimulating restrained all right ways thoroughly satisfying film overall im thrilled see what cronenberg does next final score 77 100,0.5536753856472166,0.17055164319248825,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.39}"
8.0,Intelligent Sci-Fi Ideas,"A beautiful, engaging masterpiece in storytelling. A complex and nuanced think piece with some brilliant sci-fi ideas. While all of the press went to a few flash moments of disturbing body horror, the film is not about that. In a world where pain doesn't register like it does in the real world, the uncomfortable reaction that comes from witnessing it should not be felt. The press made it seem like the film was nothing but a masochistic ""pain = sex"" taboo, but the pain and pleasure element is a function of the world, not its meaning & not even a lasting major theme. The moments of body horror are quick and done with the utmost care and without obsession. Instead, the characters acceptance or non-acceptance of a naturally changing human anatomy is central to the films main idea. The uneasiness, something the director is known for, is here and wonderful. The ideas behind it, complex and thought out for an adult brain, stay with you long after & thus the film is successful.

8.0,A surprisingly pleasant return to form from Cronenberg!,"A lot of people are passionately disliking this film and I'm not really sure what they were expecting. Have they forgotten what classic Cronenberg films are actually like? Have they lost the plot in their own skewed fantasy of a David Cronenberg film that's been distorted over years of non-exposure while his ever-emboldening reputation only feeds each delusional individual's twisted perception of his filmography?Cronenberg's fleshy visuals have always been singular, striking, and disturbing - but they've typically been an added bonus to what really makes his films legendary, and that's CONCEPT. Concept is far and away the strength and the entire point of Crimes Of The Future - the primary plot, the philosophies it presents, and all the ideas that branch out around it. Nearly every scene introduces an intriguing idea or philosophy that takes the concept one step further, and as a viewer, if you are able to keep up with it, the extremely forward-thinking ideas generally become more fathomable with every conversation. It's amusing to me that ""The Future"" is right there in the title, and still it seems that the primary problem people are having is that they cannot look ahead far enough to perceive these ideas as even remotely realistic or relatable in any manner. Well, people felt the same way about VIDEODROME when it came out in 1982, but now it makes a pretty succinct statement that can pretty easily be tied to the horrors of social networking - from the inarguable prediction about ""screen names"" and beyond.While I'm seeing a lot of people call the dialogue in this ""atrocious"", I truly found it to be some of the most intellectual and intriguing dialogue I have heard in a while. It honestly feels like you are reading a philosophy book the entire time. Considering how out-there the material is, the entire cast did a really phenomenal job sculpting out bizarre personality types that feel as if they may not exist at all YET, but certainly could in the future. Viggo Mortensen definitely steals the show with such a unique approach to a human character that it feels entirely alien. Lea Seydoux held things down as expertly as she always does, and Lihi Kornowski, Scott Speedman, and Don McKellar made great impressions on me for the first time.While the movie isn't thrilling enough to be considered any form of masterpiece, it fits in very well with Cronenberg's final decade of body horror: the 90's. This makes perfect sense since the movie was originally written in 2002, and put on hold for 20 years. (Noting this, it makes it even more impressive that the plot still feels so ahead of it's time.) This movie feels most like eXisTeNz and Naked Lunch, with hints of Crash and Videodrome. But, if you loved Dead Ringers, you should be able to get plenty into Crimes Of The Future - it's ""slower"" than a lot of classic Cronenberg, but all the elements of classic Cronenberg are there.I went in expecting a film that was all aesthetic with no heart, but I was fully proven wrong. Cronenberg is not facing Dario Argento syndrome in the way that I feared he would. David Cronenberg still has the heart and mind of an artist, and it is fully clear through Crimes of the Future. It's challenging, visceral, and feels pretty gross to watch, as it is meant to be. Much of the film feels like a reflection on David's existence as an artist himself, but its primary appeal is as an exploration of bizarre but very possible elements of our own future world.

5.0,The synopsis,"Mortensen plays a grunting Sith Lord with acid reflux who's constantly playing with himself. Then they talk about organs or something and sex but there's never any sex and then Kristen Stewart appears a few times as a nervous crying lady who's turned on by Mortensen. And then there's subplots about child murder, poisonous candy bars, a dinosaur bone high chair that feeds you crappy raviolis, and a whole lot of other whacky stuff. Also Lea Seydoux is there and she helps cut Mortensen up.

7.0,Don't spill,"Greetings again from the darkness. So, what happens when society evolves to the point that pain barely exists? Well, of course, people will then desire pain for pleasure and will go to extremes to experience the new forbidden bruised fruit. Anyone familiar with filmmaker David Cronenberg's 40+ year career is already anticipating 'what else' the master of 'body horror' and twisted provocations will add to the proceedings. And the answer is ... plenty.Viggo Mortensen stars as Saul Tenser, and Lea Seydoux co-stars as Caprice, his performance art partner with benefits (such as they may be). If you've ever wondered what a second career for a trauma surgeon might look like, well Caprice's role in the live shows is to first tattoo and then remove the newest organ that Saul's body has generated - all while the appreciative audience looks on as if Picasso were painting or Edith Piaf were singing. Wait, what? His body grows new organs? Yes, Cronenberg has set this in a future where a segment of the population has an evolved digestive system and mutations, pain has been mostly eradicated, and Saul's body grows new organs that may or may not have a legitimate function - they're never left in the body long enough to find out because it's Show time!An opening sequence features a young boy's inexplicable action, which leads his mother to an unfathomable next step. We are clearly in a (not so bright) future and Cronenberg delivers his first crime. That boy is linked to one of the many sub-plots in the film, though it's Saul and Caprice who are at the center of most. A secretive government agency is responsible for registering all new organs, and it's run by Wippet (Don McKellar) and Timlin (Kristen Stewart). Wippet worships Saul as an icon, while Timlin takes it a step further by whispering in Saul's ear, ""Surgery is the new sex."" Stewart plays polar opposite to her usual subtle on-camera style, delivering a humorous take on a curious, bird-like creature with tics and a lack of social graces.Outstanding supporting work comes from Scott Speedman, Welket Bungue, Tanaya Beatty, and Nadia Litz. I'll say little else about these characters or their story lines, because this film works best as you uncover each layer for yourself. A general description of the film would be what happens when anatomy and art collide with science-fiction. One can easily draw connective dotted lines between this Cronenberg film and many of his earlier ones. It has the bizarre sensuality of CRASH (1996), a nod to THE FLY (1986), common ground with EXISTENZ (1999), a line from DEAD RINGERS (1988), and social commentary in line from both VIDEODROME (1983) and SCANNERS (1981). This is Viggo Mortensen's fifth collaboration with Cronenberg, but surely the first where he's said, ""I'm not very good at old sex."" Carol Spier's signature Production Design plays a significant part in the film, and best I can tell, she has worked on each of Cronenberg's films since 1981. The two Canadians make a good team. It's been 8 years since Cronenberg's last film, and the 79-year-old filmmaker is already in pre-production for his next. The Inner Beauty Pageant and Accelerated Evolution Syndrome are elements within this film, and as you would expect, he delivers visual effects that will stick with you. That said, nothing is over the top, and if anything, the cult filmmaker is on pretty good behavior, though he fully expects ""walk outs"" within the first few minutes. While I'm not sure the twist is even a twist, this is vintage Cronenberg offering no apologies while choosing to leave us with yet more of his provocations ...

7.0,"A very ""typical"" David Cronenberg flick.","One thing that is always guaranteed with David Cronenberg and much of his filmography; he rarely gives you answers, if he even gives you an inkling of what the question is first. The one guarantee is he will provide strange sexual stimuli and this will either confuse you or arouse you. Frankly, it's a return to form somewhat.Having used car crashes and overtly violent images before, Cronenberg takes another view on sexual function within a society that is desperate for physical stimuli. The body is not intended to be a husk of non use, and Cronenberg always pushes the strangest buttons to prove humans are not necessarily supposed to be buttoned up and filled with shame. The biggest question at play is a political one...should we resist change or go with the flow? I say political due to the obvious allegorical story that is being told. It's open ended enough to satisfy many different political spectrums, but it seems to be addressing gender norms and possibly even sexual fluidity. What if what makes us ""human"" is on a broad spectrum, and small colliding groups are prepping for the eventual debate to determine those final distinctions?I don't know Cronenberg's politics but I do get the feeling he wants to create talking points. It's obvious society within the world of Crimes of the Future wants a very distinct definition, and the backdrop of random human evolution makes that a tricky argument. He makes it even more interesting when he implies that some people want to force this evolution, at the expense of their own bodies and own free will. Being a vegan myself, the film speaks to me because the so called group of radicals at the end are actually partaking in a lifestyle that could greatly benefit the current planet, which let's just say is a decaying remnant of itself within the film's universe.If you have seen Cronenberg films (and I mean his wild stuff, not the more accessible Eastern Promises or A History of Violence), then you might get a kick out of this strange and unusual movie.",very typical david cronenberg flick,one thing that is always guaranteed with david cronenberg much his filmography he rarely gives you answers if he even gives you inkling what question is first one guarantee is he will provide strange sexual stimuli this will either confuse you or arouse you frankly its return form somewhat having used car crashes overtly violent images before cronenberg takes another view sexual function within society that is desperate physical stimuli body is not intended be husk non use cronenberg always pushes strangest buttons prove humans are not necessarily supposed be buttoned up filled with shame biggest question at play is political one should we resist change or go with flow i say political due obvious allegorical story that is being told its open ended enough satisfy many different political spectrums but it seems be addressing gender norms possibly even sexual fluidity what if what makes us human is broad spectrum small colliding groups are prepping eventual debate determine those final distinctions i dont know cronenbergs politics but i do get feeling he wants create talking points its obvious society within world crimes future wants very distinct definition backdrop random human evolution makes that tricky argument he makes it even more interesting when he implies that some people want force this evolution at expense their own bodies own free will being vegan myself film speaks me because so called group radicals at end are actually partaking lifestyle that could greatly benefit current planet which lets just say is decaying remnant itself within films universe if you have seen cronenberg films i mean his wild stuff not more accessible eastern promises or history violence then you might get kick out this strange unusual movie,0.5175248015873015,0.10256944444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.44}"
7.0,David Cronenberg's perspective on human evolution,"Crimes of the Future features tremendous world-building and concepts, but is incomplete in its narrative. In addition to prompting one to fill in the pieces that led to this world, there also is a sense that there is more to say about characters and the world that is depicted. Those who love Cronenberg's past body horror outings may very well forgive the film's shortcomings, especially given the following vivid perspectives fully on display:1. Evolution is rapid. Human bodies are changing in our world, but writer/director David Cronenberg further accelerates this timeline. Examples include interior changes in the body, from growth of new organs to altered gastrointestinal tracts. There are much softer current-day precedents for these concepts (just two examples include changing waist-to-hip ratios in females and lower testosterone levels in younger males) - with these and likely those in the film speculated as related to changes in sleep/exercise/diet/environment. The extreme examples in the film are presented as social commentary in the form of body horror, as this is a format with which Cronenberg feels very much at home. I do like how the horror is presented in two ways: visually, and through the discussion of the fear that humans may branch off into separate subspecies.2. People are restless. Although there is no reference to the internet or social media in the world presented in Crimes of the Future, there is heightened interest in displaying changes in the human body in order to both grab attention and to feel a greater sense of personal fulfillment. Technology AND evolution have both fostered these innate and selfish desires.3. People in the society depicted in the film are not easily shocked. Although the threshold to accept previously unacceptable behaviors has attenuated in our culture (at least in the First World), The Crimes of the Future's world is on another level. Many examples abound, but the following stand out: a. A child is murdered by his mother, and there is surprisingly little visible repulsion by those who are aware of the act.B. Said child undergoes a public autopsy, with body entirely uncovered and displayed from the outset, and then abdomen is open for attendees to see internal organs. Laws preventing this activity, if at all present, are not enforced. In this dystopian future, characters reference that law enforcement and governmental agencies are not to be trusted, with characters linked with both fringe and governmental agencies accordingly shown to be unethical. This plays off of a theme that has been debated in recent years.David Cronenberg constructs a world with some uniquely horrifying characteristics, and the superb performances by this cast accentuated by a top-flight production design and Howard Shore's haunting score, all beautifully tie together the film. As above, and with other reviewer's comments thus far, various narrative aspects appear incomplete. It would be interesting to follow up these and other themes presented, and see where they go in a sequel - with even some backstory added in order to help understand how humans reached the point depicted in Crimes of the Future. Although he has not done this in the past, and time may be running out in his creative life at the age of 79, more information with another installment would very much be welcomed.",david cronenbergs perspective human evolution,crimes future features tremendous world building concepts but is incomplete its narrative addition prompting one fill pieces that led this world there also is sense that there is more say about characters world that is depicted those who love cronenbergs past body horror outings may very well forgive films shortcomings especially given following vivid perspectives fully display 1 evolution is rapid human bodies are changing our world but writer director david cronenberg further accelerates this timeline examples include interior changes body growth new organs altered gastrointestinal tracts there are much softer current day precedents these concepts just two examples include changing waist hip ratios females lower testosterone levels younger males with these likely those film speculated as related changes sleep exercise diet environment extreme examples film are presented as social commentary form body horror as this is format with which cronenberg feels very much at home i do like how horror is presented two ways visually through discussion fear that humans may branch off into separate subspecies 2 people are restless although there is no reference internet or social media world presented crimes future there is heightened interest displaying changes human body order both grab attention feel greater sense personal fulfillment technology evolution have both fostered these innate selfish desires 3 people society depicted film are not easily shocked although threshold accept previously unacceptable behaviors has attenuated our culture at least first world crimes futures world is another level many examples abound but following stand out child is murdered by his mother there is surprisingly little visible repulsion by those who are aware act b said child undergoes public autopsy with body entirely uncovered displayed outset then abdomen is open attendees see internal organs laws preventing this activity if at all present are not enforced this dystopian future characters reference that law enforcement governmental agencies are not be trusted with characters linked with both fringe governmental agencies accordingly shown be unethical this plays off theme that has been debated recent years david cronenberg constructs world with some uniquely horrifying characteristics superb performances by this cast accentuated by top flight production design howard shores haunting score all beautifully tie together film as above with other reviewers comments thus far various narrative aspects appear incomplete it would be interesting follow up these other themes presented see where they go sequel with even some backstory added order help understand how humans reached point depicted crimes future although he has not done this past time may be running out his creative life at age 79 more information with another installment would very much be welcomed,0.4189576802507837,0.0940033960292581,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.48}"

8.0,Cronenberg autopsies his own filmography,"""Crimes of the Future"" follows Saul Tenser (Viggo Mortensen) and his partner, Caprice (Lea Seydoux), performance artists living in a distant (or perhaps not so distant) future, in a world that has become increasingly inhospitable to humans; the environment has left mankind without the ability to perceive pain. This allows Tenser to be subject to radical surgeries and experiments (often undertaken in public as a performance) in which he grows novel organs and has them excised as pieces of ""art.""This new offering from David Cronenberg fits into his oeuvre like a hand in glove. Looking at his overall body of work, ""Crimes of the Future"" seems like the most logical evolution of ideas he has mulled over for decades, retreading on themes seen in many of his other films (most notably ""Crash""), and boasting visuals that are highly reminiscent of ""eXistenZ"". ""Crimes of the Future"", however, is more thought-provoking than both of those films.While there are body horror elements at play here, I don't know that I'd necessarily classify this as a horror film. It is more a dark sci-fi drama, and a meditation on the human body in a time where the body no longer is a means to life, but rather something to be experimented with, perverted, and eviscerated--oftentimes for pleasure. It is an existentially frightening concept, but the material is well-handled and the screenplay is surprisingly engrossing. The tension is woven into the narrative as Tenser becomes acquainted with two government workers (played by Kristen Stewart and Don McKellar) who ""register"" novel organs, but who also may have ulterior motives; meanwhile, Lang Dotrice (Scott Speedman), a man whose ex-wife murdered his son, also circles around Tenser with his own plans in mind.The performances here are quite good, though I would say that Seydoux is the stand-out, as she gives a highly nuanced, emotional performance in what feels like an emotionless world. Mortensen possesses a somber stoicism in this role, and Stewart's jittery performance style, which can oftentimes grate, actually works to the benefit of the character she's playing.The film's climax is appropriately gloomy, though it does not reach a fever pitch of any kind--instead, it ends in such a way that, although there is a perceivable future for these characters, the whole thing still feels like a funeral march.

2.0,Cronenberg has lost his touch in this absolute bore of a film,"Well, that was a complete waste of my time. Talk about a movie that is equally as weird as it is boring. There is so much going on, yet nothing is happening at the same time, and not a single bit of it is explained well enough to grasp. David Cronenberg has officially lost his touch as a filmmaker. Not to mention this one might win an award for the worst cinematography ever put to screen. A vast majority of the scenes were so dark that I couldn't see what was on screen and I felt like I was just staring at silhouettes of characters talking. Combine that with some really terrible cgi and you've got a recipe for the ugliest movie ever made. The only strong aspect the film has going for it is the acting. You can tell the actors really gave it their all with the material they were given. Overall, the film felt like a complete waste, and a half baked effort on behalf of the director. There is definitely a reason as to why I was the only one in the theater for this one. Also, for the preview to make this film out to be so disturbing, I can assure you it is not. Hell, it's even very light on the blood and gore, which the preview built up as well. Majorly disappointed in that category. I can recommend this film for people who want to take a nap, it will definitely put you to sleep. 1 fleshy instrument out of 5.",cronenberg has lost his touch this absolute bore film,well that was complete waste my time talk about movie that is equally as weird as it is boring there is so much going yet nothing is happening at same time not single bit it is explained well enough grasp david cronenberg has officially lost his touch as filmmaker not mention this one might win award worst cinematography ever put screen vast majority scenes were so dark that i couldnt see what was screen i felt like i was just staring at silhouettes characters talking combine that with some really terrible cgi youve got recipe ugliest movie ever made only strong aspect film has going it is acting you can tell actors really gave it their all with material they were given overall film felt like complete waste half baked effort behalf director there is definitely reason as why i was only one theater this one also preview make this film out be so disturbing i can assure you it is not hell its even very light blood gore which preview built up as well majorly disappointed that category i can recommend this film people who want take nap it will definitely put you sleep 1 fleshy instrument out 5,0.5392602040816327,-0.10277210884353741,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.49, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7.0,Outlandishly Erotic,"What starts off as a bizarro arthouse film gradually transpires into a film that feels almost too visceral.There are some absolutely breathtaking and strikingly beautiful shots in this movie. Witnessing this work of art felt like I was watching something I shouldn't be experiencing, as I felt disturbed but also entertained simultaneously in so many of the scenes.A stunning cast brought stellar performances that really elevated the stakes for all characters involved. Intense moments were brought to life through the palpable tension that Cronenberg was able to incorporate. Every word, action, and movement felt very intentional as well as masterful.The first half of this film felt extremely slow. While the pacing doesn't really seem to even pick up halfway through, it definitely became more intriguing from then on out, and I couldn't pull my attention away. My only other main issues are that this film could've incorporated more horror to feel like a true horror film, and the ending was a little too abrupt. That, and I didn't like the dark message that the film left us with, but then again I could just be looking too far into it or maybe I'm just being too sensitive.",outlandishly erotic,what starts off as bizarro arthouse film gradually transpires into film that feels almost too visceral there are some absolutely breathtaking strikingly beautiful shots this movie witnessing this work art felt like i was watching something i shouldnt be experiencing as i felt disturbed but also entertained simultaneously so many scenes stunning cast brought stellar performances that really elevated stakes all characters involved intense moments were brought life through palpable tension that cronenberg was able incorporate every word action movement felt very intentional as well as masterful first half this film felt extremely slow while pacing doesnt really seem even pick up halfway through it definitely became more intriguing then out i couldnt pull my attention away my only other main issues are that this film couldve incorporated more horror feel like true horror film ending was little too abrupt that i didnt like dark message that film left us with but then again i could just be looking too far into it or maybe im just being too sensitive,0.5655913978494623,0.23911290322580642,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,Cronenberg's return to body horror,"""Surgery is the new sex"" a character intones in David Cronenberg's return to his early ""body horror"" era films. In this dark dank dystopian world, we find Saul (Viggo Mortensen) and Caprice (Lea Seydoux) who are performance artists. Their canvas is Saul's body - more specifically, the insides of his corpus which has begun to grow new organs. Caprice surgically opens his cavity and thrill-seekers gawk and take pictures and videos. In this unspecified future, there are also an assortment of various other distorted body models, experimenters and even governmental agencies. The technology is a mishmash of forward looking cutting edge and retro. The couple's videos are projected on old CRT TVs and the audience sports everything from cutting edge ring devices to retro instamatic cameras and video cameras.CRIMES OF THE FUTURE acts almost like a greatest hits of Cronenberg's formative work with his continuing fascination of how biology and technology both intersect and effect one another. Here too, is the filmmakers fascination with deviant sexuality, perhaps never more seen than in his CRASH which was also set in a vague murky future. Here, the obsession with car accidents is replaced with one for distorting the human form. There's even a new police unit called ""New Vice"" to investigate this underworld (if that isn't the ultimate self-tribute to Cronenberg's world view!).Unlike his finest work, CRIMES doesn't have a truly compelling narrative. Saul and Caprice are glum protagonists. A few of the secondary characters display a bit more zeal, but, it's almost always from a subdued perspective. With all the new sexual thrills out there, they seem awfully repressed. The cop (Welket Bungue) does a decent job, but, nobody goes to a Cronenberg shocker to see a procedural. More crucially, the screenplay's contradictions and muddled thoughts hamper Mortensen's performance in particular. He delivers in certain scenes, but, one never really empathizes with his character. It's quite obvious early on what is going on within Saul, but he seems to be the last one to realize it. Seydoux handles the choppy script well, and there are standout supporting performances by Scott Speedman as the father of a child of the new order, and Kristen Stewart as a bureaucrat who gets truly turned on by her work. Howard Shore's score and Douglas Koch's cinematography set the mood.Where the movie partially succeeds is in its themes. The title is no accident as it echoes that of his second short feature from 1970 (it's all of 63 minutes). That version of CRIMES (and it's companion film, 1969's STEREO) certainly set the template for his early career; and there are elements from of all those formative, pre-""mainstream"" works. VIDEODROME's ""The new flesh"" has become ""The new internal organs"" here. In this Cronenberg vision, even a simple kiss is now considered some gross outrageous perversion. Beauty is now truly on the inside.",cronenbergs return body horror,surgery is new sex character intones david cronenbergs return his early body horror era films this dark dank dystopian world we find saul viggo mortensen caprice lea seydoux who are performance artists their canvas is sauls body more specifically insides his corpus which has begun grow new organs caprice surgically opens his cavity thrill seekers gawk take pictures videos this unspecified future there are also assortment various other distorted body models experimenters even governmental agencies technology is mishmash forward looking cutting edge retro couples videos are projected old crt tvs audience sports everything cutting edge ring devices retro instamatic cameras video cameras crimes future acts almost like greatest hits cronenbergs formative work with his continuing fascination how biology technology both intersect effect one another here too is filmmakers fascination with deviant sexuality perhaps never more seen than his crash which was also set vague murky future here obsession with car accidents is replaced with one distorting human form theres even new police unit called new vice investigate this underworld if that isnt ultimate self tribute cronenbergs world view unlike his finest work crimes doesnt have truly compelling narrative saul caprice are glum protagonists few secondary characters display bit more zeal but its almost always subdued perspective with all new sexual thrills out there they seem awfully repressed cop welket bungue does decent job but nobody goes cronenberg shocker see procedural more crucially screenplays contradictions muddled thoughts hamper mortensens performance particular he delivers certain scenes but one never really empathizes with his character its quite obvious early what is going within saul but he seems be last one realize it seydoux handles choppy script well there are standout supporting performances by scott speedman as father child new order kristen stewart as bureaucrat who gets truly turned by her work howard shores score douglas kochs cinematography set mood where movie partially succeeds is its themes title is no accident as it echoes that his second short feature 1970 its all 63 minutes that version crimes its companion film 1969s stereo certainly set template his early career there are elements all those formative pre mainstream works videodromes new flesh has become new internal organs here this cronenberg vision even simple kiss is now considered some gross outrageous perversion beauty is now truly inside,0.43472727272727274,0.029556277056277044,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.44}"
6.0,"Art, Just...Art, Maybe","Well, uh...how do I word this. Crimes of the Future is a conceptual, innovative, and highly...unorthodox piece of work. Set in the not-so-distant future, the movie comprises of gothic architecture, hymn-like soundtrack, and surgical instruments as if borrowed from Ridley Scotts' Prometheus. Insightful camera angles capture unconventional dialogues and graphic performances, challenging the stomach capacity of audience. The one example that got me the most was the dancer with multiple ears - genuinely disturbing while bizarrely symbolic. I suggest bringing a empty plastic bag with you while watching to reduce the amount of work for floor cleaners.The film presents a suppressive and unpredictable environment in which somatic structures mutate and evolve, consequently nurturing extreme artistic expressions. However, though with lots of explanatory dialogues, I don't quite understand the story. First of all, characters speak with implicit syntax and in low voices, as I'm unable to identify relationships, motivations, or connections of different parties. Secondly, the displayed world is so out of my understanding both ethically and behaviorally: people take bloody severance as sexual pleasure, and organ dissection as performance art. I just... don't understand honestly. Either that world's construction or the people's orientation, neither are intelligible to my humble brain.Welp, I guess Cronenberg makes art for his equally avant-garde fans, while I, a vulgar 21st-century citizen, see only the gruesome factors.",art just art maybe,well uh how do i word this crimes future is conceptual innovative highly unorthodox piece work set not so distant future movie comprises gothic architecture hymn like soundtrack surgical instruments as if borrowed ridley scotts prometheus insightful camera angles capture unconventional dialogues graphic performances challenging stomach capacity audience one example that got me most was dancer with multiple ears genuinely disturbing while bizarrely symbolic i suggest bringing empty plastic bag with you while watching reduce amount work floor cleaners film presents suppressive unpredictable environment which somatic structures mutate evolve consequently nurturing extreme artistic expressions however though with lots explanatory dialogues i dont quite understand story first all characters speak with implicit syntax low voices as im unable identify relationships motivations or connections different parties secondly displayed world is so out my understanding both ethically behaviorally people take bloody severance as sexual pleasure organ dissection as performance art i just dont understand honestly either that worlds construction or peoples orientation neither are intelligible my humble brain welp i guess cronenberg makes art his equally avant garde fans while i vulgar 21st century citizen see only gruesome factors,0.5785555555555556,-0.008277777777777783,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.42}"
7.0,I was disturbed and intrigued at the same time - thank you David Cronenberg!,"I read the reviews, saw the trailer and the film turned out to be somewhat different than what I expected (good thing). There's a ton of themes in this movie and one of them certainly being the limitless boundaries humans have to experience intense pleasure. Themes about the future of humanity (bleak), climate change and how some things don't really change - greed, selfishness and self-absorption. The lighting throughout the movie was dark with very little hope (light) which I'm sure was by design. The reason I didn't give the film an 8 was because I found the ending kind of anti-climatic. The actors were superb especially Kristen Stewart and Viggo Mortensen.",i was disturbed intrigued at same time thank you david cronenberg,i read reviews saw trailer film turned out be somewhat different than what i expected good thing theres ton themes this movie one them certainly being limitless boundaries humans have experience intense pleasure themes about future humanity bleak climate change how some things dont really change greed selfishness self absorption lighting throughout movie was dark with very little hope light which im sure was by design reason i didnt give film 8 was because i found ending kind anti climatic actors were superb especially kristen stewart viggo mortensen,0.6350198412698413,0.14503348214285713,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.3}"
