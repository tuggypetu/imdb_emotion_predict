10.0,The Truth Hurts,"People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",truth hurts,people did not like this movie simple reason too negative i can understand that this movie is so depressing so may ways what it shows that big fish eats litte fish none us want think about that anymore than most us experience it our daily life it shows battle between evangelicals corporate business man or maybe even battle between evangelicals today non religious people or atheists today even worse is that this movie shows that religious people priests are or can be as bad as corrupt oil man maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them especially paul dano playing priest both daniel day lewis paul dano are wrong too extreme their opinions people are able accept this what people cannot accept is though that these same extremities same misguided opinions both characters are very much true that they are heavily believed still today not all christains are like paul danos character not all business man are like daniel day lewiss character but many are like them that is world we live now is their any alternative or positive side answer is yes that is h w son daniel plainview daniel day lewis he epitomizes hope he shows that despite being deaf having father who uses him as ploy better business he can still break free chains that he is being tied down by what separates h w residents evangelists little boston difference is that he his father are educated they are not that is how daniel plainview is able manipulate cheat them sunday family even eli sunday paul dano priest preacher little boston what h w sees experiences he sees that much what is around him is just wrong he uses his experience that he had gained as kid break free corruption chaos that could have taken over him that is one aspect education iam talking about our experiences understanding what is happening around us now get technical aspects there will be blood it is just truly spectacular every way first off acting was amazing daniel day lewis gave arguably best performance his career playing daniel plaiview or ever since movies began be made he freaked me out probably shocked many people his thirst power money was at such high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable deceiving greed thirst power every man himself attitude actually looked more real than ever me without daniel day lewis i dont think this movie could have achieved what it has paul dano gave great performance as eli sunday though people tend disagree i think he gave great portrayal extremist evangelical priest how he himself had his own thirst power how he was more blasphemous then respectful gracious god then how you would expect priest be how could people not be shocked by these two characters i was myself why was music this movie not liked i thought this was among top five musical scores i have ever heard music perfectly gave you feeling corruption deception setting into movie it perfectly intertwined with rest movie as movie itself was ever growingly becoming more more chaotic surreal probably too shocking though paul thomas anderson i believe gave best directing job year he was able show oil fields its processes rise oil man way everyone can be bought even priest hope that h w represented this movie was never boring it was as stunning directing job as daniel day lewis gave as performance his role this movie intensity this movie was as high as movie could possibly be some credit this has go director cinematography music seemed intertwine perfectly like rest movie it gave sense time period as said before greed deception etc cinematography did not just give you negative feeling but feeling as if what you are watching is real you should not like this movie just because great technical achievements as you should not any movie but what it says how it says it im not even sure if you should enjoy this movie general but you should not be blinded by your opinions i applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie get past lying deceiving we do ourselves this movie really shows humanity human beings why is this rated r it has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting now maybe this movie was too powerful many people it was probably even shocking realists maybe though its not that surprising that so many people dont like this movie because truth hurts not truth about corruption or about people but truth about ourselves,0.5684345951206417,0.18055907916373032,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
7.0,"Phenomenal acting, not personally gripped by the story","It has been a while since I watched a film where the acting and casting is so damn convincing - I have to start this review by saying that.The plot is definitely off the beaten track anf the writing very very much a breath of fresh air.Unfortunately this is a film that can come down to tastes quite a bit when the reviews come round, and although I can't necessarily critique it specifically, there is something about it that I just couldn't get gripped by, and the ending didn't truly satisfy me (though the end scene itself is probably the high point of the movie. Confusing review, I know)This is not a negative review by any means, but 8-10 are reserved for films that truly get you talking, or have a huge emotional impact in my opinionAs a recommendation, this film is a definite yes.

10.0,There Will be Praise,"The world of cinema has seen and marveled a plethora of phenomenal performers, who over the years have entranced billions of viewers globally with their guile, grandeur, subtlety, eloquence and idiosyncrasy, but I dare say that none of their performances can match Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, for sheer ruthlessness, panache, eloquence and cheek. Being the chameleon that he truly is, Daniel Day-Lewis incredibly musters up all his prodigious talent as an actor to conjure up his misanthropic alter ego, Daniel Plainview, whose perpetually smirked face bolstered by his malice filled eyes makes him one of the strongest and the most fascinating characters ever caricatured on the silver screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game and virtually unstoppable as Daniel Plainview, a portrayal that not only resuscitated him as an actor, but also established him as someone who wouldn't leave a single stone unturned to bring his character to life and perhaps it is this very attribute that has helped him in his endeavor to be the absolute best at what he does. Paul Dano is absolutely brilliant as Eli Sunday and has complimented Daniel Day-Lewis in every sense of the word in spite of the fact that he barely had a week to prepare contrary to Daniel Day-Lewis, who had a whole year to prepare. Eli Sunday is ambitious, enigmatic, placid, pesky and pusillanimous and despite being highly contrasting to Daniel Plainview, ironically has many similarities to him, especially the uncanny demeanor that helped them both to inveigle others. It is the chemistry and the ever growing tension between them that makes the movie haunting and spectacular. There Will Be Blood is a morbid tale of greed, betrayal and obsession adorned by some great performances, visually stunning cinematography and masterful direction. Plainview owns a mine with potential silver deposits and his assiduity finally pays off when he discovers a silver ore. He sells it to acquire a crew to help him with the subsequent diggings in the mine. After the mine runs out of silver, oil is discovered in it and hence begins Plainview's journey of insatiable greed and morbid obsession. In order to acquire more oilfields and to strike out further deals easily, he adopts a young boy and names him as H.W. to help build a facade of a benevolent family man for himself. It almost takes him a decade to establish himself as a minor oilman, but this moderate success further intensifies his avarice. Subsequently, a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) visits Plainview's camp and offers to sell information about his family's ranch, which he claims to have an ocean of oil underneath it. Plainview and H.W. travel to the Sunday Ranch pretending to be on quail hunting while hiding their ulterior motive of verifying Paul's claim. Being as perspicacious as he was, it didn't take him long to find the vestiges of oil in the cracks formed due to the recent earthquake. He tries to inveigle the Sunday patriarch (who almost cried with rapture on hearing the offer) to sell him the land at a moderate price (which he calls quail price and not oil price), but is stymied by owner's ambitious son, Eli Sunday (also played by Paul Dano), who asks him to pay an additional ten thousand dollars towards the building of the Church of Third Revelation. Plainview reluctantly pays him five thousand dollars as advance and promises to pay the remaining amount once the drilling starts. Plainview assembles his crew at the Sunday Ranch and builds the first derrick. He also buys almost all of the land surrounding the Sunday Ranch so he will have not only those drilling rights but also the right to build a pipeline to the ocean to circumvent the railroads and their shipping costs. Eli wants to bless the derrick before drilling begins but Plainview rebuffs him. Using the money given by Plainview, Eli builds his church projecting himself as a preacher, faith healer and prophet. Soon the church has many followers, most of whom are Plainview's workers. Eli's increasing influence on the people and his display of false divinity starts pestering Plainview, who is further flummoxed by congregation's frequent gatherings (the daily prayers prevented the workers from taking desired rest, thereby decreasing their efficiency). Plainview beseeches Eli to make them less frequent, but Eli dismisses him with disdain. Plainview's ruthless ego is badly jolted by Eli's stubbornness and he brutally assaults him and even threatens to kill him when Eli asks him for the remaining money. Eli returns home all covered with mud after Plainview's assault and takes out his frustration on his myopic father, blaming him for acquiescing to Plainview's naked ambition. H.W. is deafened during an oil rig incident and starts behaving as a brat. Disconcerted by the change in the mannerisms of his son, he sends him away. Eli soon gets his revenge when a fellow named Bandy forces Plainview to get baptized at the Church of the Third Revelation (as a penance for a murder that Plainview committed and of which only Bandy knew). While baptizing him, Eli humiliates him by repeatedly slapping him and calling him a sinner for abandoning his hapless child. This incident further intensifies the hatred in Plainview and sets the tone for a deeply haunting finale when they meet many years later. P.T Anderson once again proves his mettle as a director and manages to pack a punch with this poignant and a deeply disturbing masterpiece. The movie incredibly succeeds on every level and entertains immensely, while still delivering a strong message. It was undoubtedly the best picture of 2007 and one of the best of the decade. In fact, it was very remiss of the academy to keep up with its long earned notoriety and prefer a relatively mediocre 'No Country for Old Man' over this truly haunting masterpiece.

10.0,Truly a piece of work,"A few months ago I saw the trailer to There Will Be Blood, at first I was a little put off, it looked very strange and a typical drawn out drama. But then a little later, I saw a different trailer that was much better and looked more interesting. So now it had all this hype and is now nominated for 7 Oscars, including best picture, finally it came to theaters in my home town and my mom and I just saw it. Now, I'm just going to get a complaint out, I think this movie was still a little drawn out, it kind of took on a Kubrick type of feel with the first twenty minutes that had no dialog. But that was the only thing that threw me off. While I'm not as in love with this movie as much as everyone else is, There Will be Blood is going to be a sure classic down the line. The direction, the acting, the script, the sets, everything about this film was done beautifully and shows the utter greed and madness that can turn men into monsters.Daniel Plainview is an oil man, he's in the business with his son, H.W., and he goes around buying land very cheaply, and makes thousands and thousands of dollars when he strikes oil. But when he comes a town called Little Boston led by the tip of a boy named Paul, he buys the land promising the church that he will donate five thousand dollars to it. Eli, the leader of the church, claims he is a prophet and goes to the extreme to prove so with his followers. When Daniel's team is draining oil, his son is blasted away from an explosion of oil and looses his hearing, Daniel at this point just goes mad and meets a man who claims to be his brother, but he later finds out that this man lied to him. He abandons his son and is loosing all sanity, but when the church comes back to him, he claims he is saved. Years later though, he goes from business man to monster and is going to ""drink Eli's milk shake"", you'll see what I mean when you see the film.There Will Be Blood is a film of utter perfection, the reason why I'm rating it so high is because it is a perfectly made film. There's nothing wrong with it, when I said it's a little drawn out, it's just my opinion. But Daniel Day Lewis pulls in a flawless performance and became Daniel Plainview, especially the end, he pulled in such a chilling side and didn't over do the dialog, which I'm sure any other actor would have done. But one performance I am particularly impressed with is Paul Dano's as Eli/Paul, Eli really got to me and was incredible during his sermons, he held his own up to Lewis. He's come a long way since the silent rebel in Litte Miss Sunshine. There Will Be Blood is a GOOD movie, I mean good in the highest regards, because how many of us can say when a film is just utterly good? Not too often. There Will Be Blood is going to be a good contender this year for the Oscars, but we'll just have to see who'll take the best picture award, because we have some good films that are competing.10/10",truly piece work,few months ago i saw trailer there will be blood at first i was little put off it looked very strange typical drawn out drama but then little later i saw different trailer that was much better looked more interesting so now it had all this hype is now nominated 7 oscars including best picture finally it came theaters my home town my mom i just saw it now im just going get complaint out i think this movie was still little drawn out it kind took kubrick type feel with first twenty minutes that had no dialog but that was only thing that threw me off while im not as love with this movie as much as everyone else is there will be blood is going be sure classic down line direction acting script sets everything about this film was done beautifully shows utter greed madness that can turn men into monsters daniel plainview is oil man hes business with his son h w he goes around buying land very cheaply makes thousands thousands dollars when he strikes oil but when he comes town called little boston led by tip boy named paul he buys land promising church that he will donate five thousand dollars it eli leader church claims he is prophet goes extreme prove so with his followers when daniels team is draining oil his son is blasted away explosion oil looses his hearing daniel at this point just goes mad meets man who claims be his brother but he later finds out that this man lied him he abandons his son is loosing all sanity but when church comes back him he claims he is saved years later though he goes business man monster is going drink elis milk shake youll see what i mean when you see film there will be blood is film utter perfection reason why im rating it so high is because it is perfectly made film theres nothing wrong with it when i said its little drawn out its just my opinion but daniel day lewis pulls flawless performance became daniel plainview especially end he pulled such chilling side didnt over do dialog which im sure any other actor would have done but one performance i am particularly impressed with is paul danos as eli paul eli really got me was incredible during his sermons he held his own up lewis hes come long way since silent rebel litte miss sunshine there will be blood is good movie i mean good highest regards because how many us can say when film is just utterly good not too often there will be blood is going be good contender this year oscars but well just have see wholl take best picture award because we have some good films that are competing 10 10,0.5704098360655737,0.19544171220400725,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,One of the best of the last decade,"There Will be Blood! What a fine film! In fact I would go as far to say it is one of the best of the last decade. Visually, it is stunning, I loved the skillful cinematography and shots and the scenery was amazing. Jonny Greenwood's music is atmospheric and haunting as well, the script is lyrical, hysterical and sometimes even baffling, the story is excellent and thematically rich and the pace is fine, quite slow but deliberately so.There Will be Blood is brilliantly directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and the characters are intriguing. In fact to me the character of Daniel Plainview makes the movie. Magnificently portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis, he is quite complex- while monstrous and cold-hearted, because of his love for his adopted son I wouldn't necessarily call him completely evil either. Paul Dano also does a fine job as Eli Sunday.Overall, a truly fine film and one of the best of the last decade in my view. 10/10 Bethany Cox",one best last decade,there will be blood what fine film fact i would go as far say it is one best last decade visually it is stunning i loved skillful cinematography shots scenery was amazing jonny greenwoods music is atmospheric haunting as well script is lyrical hysterical sometimes even baffling story is excellent thematically rich pace is fine quite slow but deliberately so there will be blood is brilliantly directed by paul thomas anderson characters are intriguing fact me character daniel plainview makes movie magnificently portrayed by daniel day lewis he is quite complex while monstrous cold hearted because his love his adopted son i wouldnt necessarily call him completely evil either paul dano also does fine job as eli sunday overall truly fine film one best last decade my view 10 10 bethany cox,0.5839285714285715,0.2657738095238096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.39}"

6.0,"Disappointing and empty film, with an amazing central performance","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an ambitious, slimy oil tycoon who begins building up an empire in the southwest using his considerable charm, his adoptive son H.W. (Dillon Freasier/Russell Harvard), and ruthless business acumen. He descends on the town of Little Boston, California, building a huge oil derrick and enriching the town. He clashes with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the fanatical young preacher, develops a strained relationship with his son (who is deafened in an accident), and solidifies his empire - but at the same time begins to unravel as a person.""There Will Be Blood"" has received mountains of acclaim, as one of the best films not only of the year, but of the decade - and by some, of all time. It's easy to see why, as the film has a great deal going for it: an interesting-on-paper story, impressive direction and cinematography, and most of all, an amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. But at the heart of TWBB is an emptiness, which not even the greatest performance can assuage, and that is the character of Daniel Plainview.The film begins promisingly, with a brilliant fifteen-minute opening scene devoid of dialogue, as Plainview and his associates dig out their first oil well. The introduction to Plainview as a slippery, manipulative man is well-done, and the first two hours or so are gripping. I sat engrossed, comfortable in knowing that all of the build-up would lead somewhere great. Unfortunately, towards the end, I realized that the opposite was true; the film wasn't leading anywhere, and indeed my enjoyment of it largely ended with a painfully contrived and ridiculous anti-climax.The movie has a number of problems in narrative structure. It doesn't have much in the way of a traditional storyline. This is not inherently a bad thing, but the detached nature of the film makes it hard to care about what goes on. The only fully developed thread is the troubled relationship between Plainview and his son H.W., whom the former views as prop to manipulate his competitors and showcase his success. And even this is dropped like a potato at the end of the film. There is also the digressive nonsense of Plainview's ""brother"" (Kevin J. O'Conner) which adds nothing to the film.Another flaw is the movie's lack of context. Though it is set in the early 1900's - a turbulent time when the US government led by Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson were tearing down business monopolies - there is no political or historical context beyond super-titles and a few brief mentions of Standard Oil. As the film was essentially a character study, I wasn't expecting an in-depth examination of politics and history, but a few illusions to the time period beyond ""1911"" flashing on the screen would have helped. The attacks on the hypocrisy of religion and big business are socialist primer material (unsurprising given the source is an Upton Sinclair novel) and bring nothing new to the table.The basic problem of the film is in its lead, Daniel Plainview. Not in Daniel Day-Lewis, mind you, who gives one of the greatest performances in recent memory, but in the character itself. Plainview would be an interesting supporting character or villain, a slimy, manipulative man who thoroughly hates everyone besides himself. But there really isn't any depth to Plainview, and thus the film has a hollow center. He doesn't develop over the course of the story; he remains the same character throughout, a bitter, greedy misanthrope, and after awhile he becomes little more than a caricature of an evil businessman.The main reason to see this film is Daniel Day-Lewis. While I wasn't particularly enamored of his turn as Bill the Butcher, Day-Lewis's amazing turn as Plainview almost overcomes the script's shortcomings. Day-Lewis is a fascinating premise, and the brilliance of his performance conversely accentuates the weakness of his character. If it were in aide of something better, Plainview would be the most memorable character in the last twenty years of cinema. As it stands, it's still a remarkable achievement, and if Day-Lewis doesn't win an Oscar there is no justice.Other than Day-Lewis, the cast is non-descript. Paul Dano has received acclaim for his performance as Eli Sunday, but the role requires little more than elementary ham acting. The film's climax in particular illustrate the weakness of his performance. There are a few names in the supporting cast (Ciaran Hinds, Kevin J. O'Connor), but they remain in the background throughout. Cinematography, music and direction by Paul Thomas Anderson are all fabulous, with memorable set-pieces such as the oil explosion and the aforementioned beginning stand-out, but they do little more than cover up the weakness at the heart of the film.""There Will Be Blood"" looks like it should be a great film, but it is a deeply flawed movie with a weak central character. Nonetheless, it's worth a look, and if nothing else Day-Lewis should make it interesting.6/10",disappointing empty film with amazing central performance,daniel plainview daniel day lewis is ambitious slimy oil tycoon who begins building up empire southwest using his considerable charm his adoptive son h w dillon freasier russell harvard ruthless business acumen he descends town little boston california building huge oil derrick enriching town he clashes with eli sunday paul dano fanatical young preacher develops strained relationship with his son who is deafened accident solidifies his empire but at same time begins unravel as person there will be blood has received mountains acclaim as one best films not only year but decade by some all time its easy see why as film has great deal going it interesting paper story impressive direction cinematography most all amazing performance by daniel day lewis but at heart twbb is emptiness which not even greatest performance can assuage that is character daniel plainview film begins promisingly with brilliant fifteen minute opening scene devoid dialogue as plainview his associates dig out their first oil well introduction plainview as slippery manipulative man is well done first two hours or so are gripping i sat engrossed comfortable knowing that all build up would lead somewhere great unfortunately towards end i realized that opposite was true film wasnt leading anywhere indeed my enjoyment it largely ended with painfully contrived ridiculous anti climax movie has number problems narrative structure it doesnt have much way traditional storyline this is not inherently bad thing but detached nature film makes it hard care about what goes only fully developed thread is troubled relationship between plainview his son h w whom former views as prop manipulate his competitors showcase his success even this is dropped like potato at end film there is also digressive nonsense plainviews brother kevin j oconner which adds nothing film another flaw is movies lack context though it is set early 1900s turbulent time when us government led by theodore roosevelt william taft woodrow wilson were tearing down business monopolies there is no political or historical context beyond super titles few brief mentions standard oil as film was essentially character study i wasnt expecting depth examination politics history but few illusions time period beyond 1911 flashing screen would have helped attacks hypocrisy religion big business are socialist primer material unsurprising given source is upton sinclair novel bring nothing new table basic problem film is its lead daniel plainview not daniel day lewis mind you who gives one greatest performances recent memory but character itself plainview would be interesting supporting character or villain slimy manipulative man who thoroughly hates everyone besides himself but there really isnt any depth plainview thus film has hollow center he doesnt develop over course story he remains same character throughout bitter greedy misanthrope after awhile he becomes little more than caricature evil businessman main reason see this film is daniel day lewis while i wasnt particularly enamored his turn as bill butcher day lewiss amazing turn as plainview almost overcomes scripts shortcomings day lewis is fascinating premise brilliance his performance conversely accentuates weakness his character if it were aide something better plainview would be most memorable character last twenty years cinema as it stands its still remarkable achievement if day lewis doesnt win oscar there is no justice other than day lewis cast is non descript paul dano has received acclaim his performance as eli sunday but role requires little more than elementary ham acting films climax particular illustrate weakness his performance there are few names supporting cast ciaran hinds kevin j oconnor but they remain background throughout cinematography music direction by paul thomas anderson are all fabulous with memorable set pieces such as oil explosion aforementioned beginning stand out but they do little more than cover up weakness at heart film there will be blood looks like it should be great film but it is deeply flawed movie with weak central character nonetheless its worth look if nothing else day lewis should make it interesting 6 10,0.5012449568572019,0.1554771475689843,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,Original but Flawed Work,"There Will Be Blood (2007) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Ambitious film about an oil man (Daniel Day-Lewis) who will stop at nothing to find the black gold. I must be honest and say I don't know what the whole point of this film was or if it was just trying to show evilness in the world but this 158-minute film kept my interest throughout. I think the film drags somewhat right before the final act but outside of that this is a very good epic that certainly has the look and feel of epics from decades ago. The visual style of the film is the most impressive thing as Anderson's camera takes us on quite a journey and also shows off some amazing locations. Another great thing is how we see how oil was produced back in the day and all the small details on the screen make for a very impressive history lesson. I also loved the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, which are done without dialogue. We see Day-Lewis' rise and how he got started within these opening scenes and even though there isn't a line of dialogue spoken we still learn everything we need to know about him. A lot has been said about the performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and while it is a great one I wouldn't call it the best of his career. I think he played this same type of character in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York and I think he was a lot better there but that's certainly not a slam against his performance here because he's great here as well. That snake quality the actor brings to this role is quite memorable and even when he's doing something good or worthwhile, you can still see that evilness in his eyes. The supporting cast were mostly good but they are miles behind Day-Lewis and I think this hurt in several scenes including the ones with the preacher (Paul Dano). Dano is pretty good in the role but the part needed someone a lot stronger who could match wits with Day-Lewis.",original but flawed work,there will be blood 2007 1 2 out 4 ambitious film about oil man daniel day lewis who will stop at nothing find black gold i must be honest say i dont know what whole point this film was or if it was just trying show evilness world but this 158 minute film kept my interest throughout i think film drags somewhat right before final act but outside that this is very good epic that certainly has look feel epics decades ago visual style film is most impressive thing as andersons camera takes us quite journey also shows off some amazing locations another great thing is how we see how oil was produced back day all small details screen make very impressive history lesson i also loved first fifteen or twenty minutes film which are done without dialogue we see day lewis rise how he got started within these opening scenes even though there isnt line dialogue spoken we still learn everything we need know about him lot has been said about performance daniel day lewis while it is great one i wouldnt call it best his career i think he played this same type character martin scorseses gangs new york i think he was lot better there but thats certainly not slam against his performance here because hes great here as well that snake quality actor brings this role is quite memorable even when hes doing something good or worthwhile you can still see that evilness his eyes supporting cast were mostly good but they are miles behind day lewis i think this hurt several scenes including ones with preacher paul dano dano is pretty good role but part needed someone lot stronger who could match wits with day lewis,0.5645995670995673,0.3473040555935292,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.22}"

10.0,"Brilliant and chilling, ""Blood"" will leave you speechless","Words don't describe Paul Thomas Anderson's latest epic film project, and he doesn't let them dominate the story either. A significant chunk of ""There Will Be Blood"" has no dialogue and the ability for it to stay so captivating is only a testament to Anderson's incredible ability to tell stories about people through images that says more than about what's happening.Anderson's weapon in this film is no secret. It isn't often Daniel Day-Lewis's name shows up on a marquee these days, especially when it's not tied to something that is sure to be good. This latest choice of his, however, is better than good and so is he. His character, Daniel Plainview, a self-proclaimed ""oilman,"" is deeply complex and troubled. The way that Day- Lewis plays the lighter parts and seamlessly transitions to the darker parts is chillingly believable. Plainview is not only interesting, but he's embraceable, despicable, amusing and frightening all throughout the film.The only truly supporting cast is his son and a self-proclaimed prophet that he comes into complications with played by Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine). Dano's performance is unfortunately shadowed by Day-Lewis and it does feel like he was too young to be cast, but the 23-year-old is highly impressive and will perhaps be a marquee name in the near future.""Blood"" is otherwise the strength of Anderson and his crew. The original score by Jonny Greenwood, who is mostly known for his guitar skills in Hollywood, brings something abstract that simultaneously fits the film's generally quiet demeanor using a variety of percussion sounds and few musical notes. While some films prefer soaring John Williams themes, Greenwood's theme for ""Blood"" is one dissonant chord and a sound effect that can be best described as a more painful version of the THX sound system effect. It's harsh, but so is the film. Anderson makes every moment count whether it's when there's music or where he puts the camera.To best describe the film in terms of people familiar with Anderson's work, it's his first film that truly translates to the interests of all dramatic film-lovers. It is distinctly his film, yet viewers will be able to grasp it much more easily than the abstract and obscure multiple storyline nature of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" For people new to his work, be prepared to feel some discomfort, but if you pay attention to the way the story is told, then you'll find the mastery of ""Blood.""",brilliant chilling blood will leave you speechless,words dont describe paul thomas andersons latest epic film project he doesnt let them dominate story either significant chunk there will be blood has no dialogue ability it stay so captivating is only testament andersons incredible ability tell stories about people through images that says more than about whats happening andersons weapon this film is no secret it isnt often daniel day lewiss name shows up marquee these days especially when its not tied something that is sure be good this latest choice his however is better than good so is he his character daniel plainview self proclaimed oilman is deeply complex troubled way that day lewis plays lighter parts seamlessly transitions darker parts is chillingly believable plainview is not only interesting but hes embraceable despicable amusing frightening all throughout film only truly supporting cast is his son self proclaimed prophet that he comes into complications with played by paul dano little miss sunshine danos performance is unfortunately shadowed by day lewis it does feel like he was too young be cast but 23 year old is highly impressive will perhaps be marquee name near future blood is otherwise strength anderson his crew original score by jonny greenwood who is mostly known his guitar skills hollywood brings something abstract that simultaneously fits films generally quiet demeanor using variety percussion sounds few musical notes while some films prefer soaring john williams themes greenwoods theme blood is one dissonant chord sound effect that can be best described as more painful version thx sound system effect its harsh but so is film anderson makes every moment count whether its when theres music or where he puts camera best describe film terms people familiar with andersons work its his first film that truly translates interests all dramatic film lovers it is distinctly his film yet viewers will be able grasp it much more easily than abstract obscure multiple storyline nature boogie nights magnolia people new his work be prepared feel some discomfort but if you pay attention way story is told then youll find mastery blood,0.5994154508043396,0.23655303030303035,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,One of the most memorable characters of 2007 in one of the year's best films,"Wunderkind Paul Thomas Anderson's new film calls to mind Orson Welles' Citizen Kane in its themes and subject, and, shockingly, it's a good enough film to sit side by side with the one most often dubbed the greatest movie ever. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector who will do anything to be a success in the business. Much like Citizen Kane, There Will Be Blood depicts how the lust for money will eventually alienate every human being around you, and eventually make you completely isolated from the world. Unlike Citizen Kane, Daniel Plainview doesn't just grow apart from the world, he also becomes insane. There is a lot of metaphorical subtext lining the film's bottom, especially concerning the relationship between fundamentalist Christianity and big business. It's all very interesting to ponder. I don't know if I think the film is one of the most intellectually stimulating movies I've ever seen. For the record, I don't think Citizen Kane is, either. The message ""money corrupts"", while probably true, isn't especially insightful. What both films have in spades is a director with incredible talent who can envelop their audience in the rapturous experience of pure cinema. The desolate, desert setting sucks you in deeply and never lets you go. Every gravelly word spoken by Day-Lewis is anticipated with both glee and dread. It could have went on for three more hours, and only my bladder would have given notice. My only small grumble is Paul Dano in the final scene. He's good throughout, don't get me wrong, but that final sequence takes place over a decade after the last time we saw Eli Sunday. Daniel Plainview has aged, his son (as a child wonderfully played by the wide-eyed Dillon Freasier) has aged. Why is nothing done to Paul Dano to make him look older? At least give him a mustache! I think there must have been a reason for it, but I can't for the life of me imagine what that would be.

9.0,"Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job playing a maniacal and, shall I say, oily character","I had heard about what a great movie ""There Will Be Blood"" is. A friend of my family said that she didn't really like the movie, but described a certain sound in it.Well, now that I've seen the movie, there are a few things that I can say about it. First, Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job playing the completely maniacal, amoral, self-aggrandizing oil magnate Daniel Plainview. Second, Plainview's speech about how he'll bring all the modern amenities to the small town; that brings to mind the fact that the whole American west now does have all those things...they put all these things in the middle of the desert, prompting everyone to use a lot of water, resulting in water shortages. Third, the subject of petroleum calls to mind present-day international politics. Finally, I would say that Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano each individually are better than the movie as a whole (not to diminish the film).Probably the most intense scene is the final segment: there's what Plainview does to his son and then to Paul Sunday (or is it Eli?). All in all, it not only adds up to a very good movie, but Paul Thomas Anderson (""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"") is showing himself to be a very good director.",daniel day lewis does great job playing maniacal shall i say oily character,i had heard about what great movie there will be blood is friend my family said that she didnt really like movie but described certain sound it well now that ive seen movie there are few things that i can say about it first daniel day lewis does great job playing completely maniacal amoral self aggrandizing oil magnate daniel plainview second plainviews speech about how hell bring all modern amenities small town that brings mind fact that whole american west now does have all those things they put all these things middle desert prompting everyone use lot water resulting water shortages third subject petroleum calls mind present day international politics finally i would say that daniel day lewis paul dano each individually are better than movie as whole not diminish film probably most intense scene is final segment theres what plainview does his son then paul sunday or is it eli all all it not only adds up very good movie but paul thomas anderson boogie nights magnolia is showing himself be very good director,0.4499343185550082,0.22646962233169135,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.32}"
2.0,A Rather Excruciating Two And A Half Hours,"I think the last significant movie I saw that featured Daniel Day-Lewis in a significant role was ""Gangs of New York."" I was reminded of that movie somewhat. My reaction to ""Gangs"" was that it was dreadfully dull, although it did have a smattering of action here and there and at least I could see by the end that there was a point to the whole thing. Its high rating notwithstanding, I have to pin ""There Will Be Blood"" with the same dreadfully dull tag. The difference between this and ""Gangs"" is that there was precious little action to be found here, long stretches of nothingness (about ten minutes passes by at the start of the movie with no dialogue at all) and in the end I really couldn't see what the point of this was. Some parts of this movie are well done. The portrayal of the Old West was totally believable, the look at early oil drilling was interesting, the performances from Day-Lewis as silver miner turned oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as the charismatic preacher Eli Sunday were good and the final confrontation between Plainview and his ""son"" (Russell Harvard) was very emotional. Overall, though, to me the story didn't seem to flow all that well. It just completely failed to capture my attention, and trying to keep focused on a movie that is just plain uninteresting for two and a half hours is excruciating. For whatever reason I also found the musical score by Jonny Greenwood to be at times inappropriate in that it often just didn't seem to fit the mood of what I was seeing on the screen.

4.0,'Blood' and oil do not mix,"With all of the hype surrounding Daniel Day-Lewis' performance (he was, in fact, given a Best Actor nod from the San Diego Film Critics Society, for whatever that is worth) in the P.T. Anderson-directed tale of early American oil speculation, ""There Will Be Blood,"" I can only relate my extreme disappointment.This would have made an interesting 90-minute movie, but, unfortunately, it runs over 140-minutes, most of which is smeared with plasma and petroleum to the extent every character is sullied and unrecognizable as a human being.Perhaps Anderson wanted it that way, after all, it's really only Day-Lewis¹ character (the lubricious Daniel Plainview) that even comes close to developing; the others are simply there to keep him company and accept his violent tirades.Yes, times were tough in the early hardscrabble years of the American West, but this guy makes Jonas Cord (""The Carpetbaggers"") look like Mother Theresa.We first meet Plainview in 1898 mining for silver in Arizona. After a nasty fall in which he breaks his ankle, he discovers oil in the shaft. After a few years, he has a crew and a few successful wells.One day, a fellow worker ­ there with his infant son (for some reason) ­is killed and Plainview adopts the boy, H. W. (Dillion Freasier) for no other reason than to have a cute face to show while he cons the public (see ""Paper Moon"").These are some of the movie's best scenes, with Plainview - and H.W. in tow - visiting backwoods bergs and convincing a gullible populace into signing away land rights for a fraction of what they were worth. Plainview, with a sinister soft-spoken demeanor plays psychological games until the rubes are all but ready to GIVE him the oil rights in perpetuity. Several years later, a visitor tells Plainview about a ranch in California that is soaking in oil, so Pop and son head out there, under the pretense of hunting quail. There they meet the Sunday family, addled dad, Abel (David Willis), a few non-descript females and an Evangelist son, Eli (Paul Dano, ""Little Miss Sunshine"").Plainview and Eli do not hit it off at all, and this is the conflict that sets up the second act. It doesn't take much to finagle Abel out of the Sunday Ranch, as well as the surrounding property, but several tragedies cause many in the town ­ especially the young preacher ­ to wonder if they made the right move in letting Plainview into their midst.When H.W. is rendered deaf in an explosion and disastrous fire, we wonder if the whole enterprise is worth it.Up until this point, I was willing to go along with this film as not only a historical drama relating the days of the early oil industry, as well as a chronicle of rural religious fervor, sort of ""Oklahoma Crude"" meets ""The Apostle.""The problem is, the picture does not continue to walk that thin line. We are now subjected to scene after scene of Plainview¹s descent into madness and murder ­ but with little or no motivation for either.For example, he beats Eli severely and mocks his church; meets a man who claims he¹s his brother; abandons H.W. and generally spirals out of control.He's business savvy, however, and plans to build a pipeline to transport his vast oil reserves to the coast (thus eliminating the cost of railroad shipping). To do this, though, he has to build through a local hermit's (Hans Howes, ""Seabiscuit"") land.The only way to accomplish this is to humble himself before Eli and the congregation and be baptized, obviously a fate worse than death to Plainview who seems to have no morals, whatsoever.Now that he¹s joined the church and gotten his pipeline built, does he enjoy even one iota of his success? Absolutely not.In one of Day-Lewis' many monologues, he gives us his motivation for being such a bastard, ""I do not just want to succeed, I do not want anyone else to succeed.""Still, that does not explain his psychotic, murderous frenzy, and the longer the film goes on, the less cohesive it became.I can accept his tirades early on, and even a bit of his unmotivated violence near the middle of the film, but Anderson pushes things to the extreme limit.

,Not as legendary as people claim,"This film is about a oil businessman who stops at nothing to gain power and wealth. His morals deteriorate with his increasing wealth.At the moment ""There Will Be Blood"" is the top 23th film on IMDb. People hail Daniel Day Lewis as the best living actor, and this is his best performance. According to the posters in the local cinema, Daniel Day Lewis has got over 50 best actor nominations for this role alone. As a result, I have very high expectations on this film.Daniel Day Lewis is definitely great as Daniel, but I find it rather unfair that Paul Dano does not get any attention. Paul Dano is excellent as a religious leader, and he constantly impressed me with his passionate speeches. The other characters, I am afraid, are not as memorable.As for the plot, it is good in outlining how Daniel's morals decline deeper and deeper. However, I think it does not portray the consequences of his declining morals enough. It would be great to see the moral repercussions of his dirty deeds, and the emotional impact of such acts on others. The current plot only displays how he becomes increasingly corrupted, and I find this less than satisfying.The beginning speechless introduction is far too long, and the ending is far too abrupt and fast. It is disappointing that it does not portray more of Daniel and his son's relationship between his son coming back and his marriage. I would also liked to see more of his son's reaction and emotions after being told the truth. The initial 30 minutes can easily be shortened to make way for interaction between Daniel and his son. Actually the whole film can be shortened, and the pace quickened, without affecting the story.I think ""There Will Be Blood"" is not as legendary as people claim.",not as legendary as people claim,this film is about oil businessman who stops at nothing gain power wealth his morals deteriorate with his increasing wealth at moment there will be blood is top 23th film imdb people hail daniel day lewis as best living actor this is his best performance according posters local cinema daniel day lewis has got over 50 best actor nominations this role alone as result i have very high expectations this film daniel day lewis is definitely great as daniel but i find it rather unfair that paul dano does not get any attention paul dano is excellent as religious leader he constantly impressed me with his passionate speeches other characters i am afraid are not as memorable as plot it is good outlining how daniels morals decline deeper deeper however i think it does not portray consequences his declining morals enough it would be great see moral repercussions his dirty deeds emotional impact such acts others current plot only displays how he becomes increasingly corrupted i find this less than satisfying beginning speechless introduction is far too long ending is far too abrupt fast it is disappointing that it does not portray more daniel his sons relationship between his son coming back his marriage i would also liked see more his sons reaction emotions after being told truth initial 30 minutes can easily be shortened make way interaction between daniel his son actually whole film can be shortened pace quickened without affecting story i think there will be blood is not as legendary as people claim,0.621390243902439,0.2640162601626016,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"
5.0,Perhaps Too Art House For Its Own Good,"I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released in the cinemas , a story of single minded obsession with some great reviews from Daniel Day Lewis performance . Only problem was when I checked the local listings of the local Odeon cinemas it wasn't being screened . Nor was it being screened at the Edinburgh film house which left me puzzled . I did find out that it screened at the Edinburgh Cameo but had finished its run before I got a chance to see it . I was puzzled that film that received much critical acclaim didn't get a wider release but after seeing it on Sky movies I'm somewhat surprised it got so much acclaim in the first place There's a term invented by the American film critic David Bordwell called "" intensified continuity "" which in its simplest term is "" MTV style directing "" . Scorsese did this with GOODFELLAS and CASINO , Oliver Stone with all of his 90s work and Francis Ford Coppolla with Dracula . Bordwell does make a point that shot length seems to be increasing in the late noughties compared to the 1990s . Interestingly NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN which came out the same year as this had a similar , long , rather slow , old fashioned feel to it . But at least NO COUNTRY was a plot driven thriller where as THERE WILL BE BLOOD is character driven which means it can be painfully tedious at some points The cinematography is good and Lewis certainly isn't bad as Plainview , but the problem is in the cinematic storytelling . The film starts with long sequences with no dialogue and these scenes drags on . There's also a problem with trying to figure out what the message is . You could understand if there's a sympathetic Marxist slant on the fundamental flaws of capitalism but then Plainview's nemesis is shown to be a preacher who isn't exactly portrayed in a good light . Moral ambiguity or moral equivalence ? A thinly disguised attack on George W Bush ? I doubt it , more likely it's just an art-house hit that received more praise than it possibly deserved .There's not much wrong with it per se . As I said it's a film that is shot and framed well with good cinematography and good performances . However for audience members like myself whose main interest in watching cinema is narrative it's a film that I'm in no hurry to rewatch",perhaps too art house its own good,i was looking forward seeing this when it was released cinemas story single minded obsession with some great reviews daniel day lewis performance only problem was when i checked local listings local odeon cinemas it wasnt being screened nor was it being screened at edinburgh film house which left me puzzled i did find out that it screened at edinburgh cameo but had finished its run before i got chance see it i was puzzled that film that received much critical acclaim didnt get wider release but after seeing it sky movies im somewhat surprised it got so much acclaim first place theres term invented by american film critic david bordwell called intensified continuity which its simplest term is mtv style directing scorsese did this with goodfellas casino oliver stone with all his 90s work francis ford coppolla with dracula bordwell does make point that shot length seems be increasing late noughties compared 1990s interestingly no country old men which came out same year as this had similar long rather slow old fashioned feel it but at least no country was plot driven thriller where as there will be blood is character driven which means it can be painfully tedious at some points cinematography is good lewis certainly isnt bad as plainview but problem is cinematic storytelling film starts with long sequences with no dialogue these scenes drags theres also problem with trying figure out what message is you could understand if theres sympathetic marxist slant fundamental flaws capitalism but then plainviews nemesis is shown be preacher who isnt exactly portrayed good light moral ambiguity or moral equivalence thinly disguised attack george w bush i doubt it more likely its just art house hit that received more praise than it possibly deserved theres not much wrong with it per se as i said its film that is shot framed well with good cinematography good performances however audience members like myself whose main interest watching cinema is narrative its film that im no hurry rewatch,0.5068383167220376,0.12812846068660025,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,A marvellous character study of ambition gone sour and endless greed,"As a struggling silver miner, Daniel Plainview scrapes together a living until he stumbles upon a more profitable route for this talents - oil drilling. Starting small with one crew and one pitch, the film follows the growth of Plainview's business as he starts to expand. When he learns of oil-rich land out west in California, he and his young son head out there to capture the land and the rights to drill in the area. It is here that he meets the aspiring preacher Eli Sunday, who is interested in what the oil profits can do for his church. As with many of his recent ventures, this new location is a success although, with every victory and crushed competitor, Plainview's drive and ambition grows and consumes all around him.I had heard so much hype and praise for this film on its release that I decided to wait a while before going to see it; after all then someone is saying that it ""rewrites cinema"" (or words to that effect) then it is hard to come to it as an individual without feeling the pressure to praise it and love it so as to not stand out from the crowd. Recently I watched it and was pleased by how easily I was drawn into it but also how quickly the three hour running time flew past. From the very start the story-telling begins and through simple scenes we come to understand the drive and sacrifice made by Plainview to even have a foot on the ladder. It is to the film's credit that it does not paint him as unworthy of the success he will find this way and the viewer is not able to hate him for his intrepid spirit and hard work. It goes without saying that the film follows the logical extension of his drive to succeed and that the next two-thirds of the film presents a much harsher and unpleasant side to this ambition.It is a subject I have often wondered about because the CEO of where I work is in his sixties but is still working and active, making hundreds of thousands each day with shares movements and deals - what makes him keep going when he could clearly just pack it in, buy an island and sit on it. Well, whatever it is, it is probably the same motivation that got him to the position he is in. I am not in any way aligning the two men, but with There Will Be Blood, this is very much the crux of the film as it is a character piece looking at Plainview in this regard. The way it does it is with patience and intelligence so that it is never a matter of one act that pushes him too far, or one moment that flicks a switch within him but rather that it is simple, logical and totally natural for this character. I do think that the conclusion perhaps could have been better but otherwise it is a faultless piece of work.Visually the film is striking. Not for any one image or moment of style though, but for the endlessly eye-catching framing of shots or positioning of the camera. The canvas of the western is of course present but we are never staring at it and somehow, even as two characters greet each other by a pipe being buried against a wide horizon, we are still focused on the tiny characters. A lot of this has to do with an utterly convincing performance from Daniel Day Lewis - it has been said loads but I cannot help but repeat how good it is. Again, it is not down to one moment that can be used as a clip for the Oscars but rather a complete immersion in the character so that he is able to convince whether as a man starting out or a man who is at the end of his life. No matter how impressive the visuals, you never take your eyes of him. To me he is the whole film and the support cast do struggle by being in his shadow to a certain extent, but mostly they all still work. Dano is probably the secondary most important character in the piece and he does pretty well with it although he doesn't really seem to age across the film, which I found distracting and detracting from his work.Along with the visual structure, the use of music is impressive, never forcing its way over the action and only ever being part of what is happening - it is the Academy's loss that they ""couldn't"" recognise the score because the absence of this film makes them look daft. Indeed, in hindsight, so does the dominance at the awards of No Country For Old Men and it should have been more of an even split because they are both very good and very thoughtful films - although for me There Will Be Blood has it over the Cohen's here. OK it is not as entertaining or as accessible a film as that thriller but it is much more engaging and interesting in what it does. From script through acting, filming, scoring and total delivery, it is a magnificent film.",marvellous character study ambition gone sour endless greed,as struggling silver miner daniel plainview scrapes together living until he stumbles upon more profitable route this talents oil drilling starting small with one crew one pitch film follows growth plainviews business as he starts expand when he learns oil rich land out west california he his young son head out there capture land rights drill area it is here that he meets aspiring preacher eli sunday who is interested what oil profits can do his church as with many his recent ventures this new location is success although with every victory crushed competitor plainviews drive ambition grows consumes all around him i had heard so much hype praise this film its release that i decided wait while before going see it after all then someone is saying that it rewrites cinema or words that effect then it is hard come it as individual without feeling pressure praise it love it so as not stand out crowd recently i watched it was pleased by how easily i was drawn into it but also how quickly three hour running time flew past very start story telling begins through simple scenes we come understand drive sacrifice made by plainview even have foot ladder it is films credit that it does not paint him as unworthy success he will find this way viewer is not able hate him his intrepid spirit hard work it goes without saying that film follows logical extension his drive succeed that next two thirds film presents much harsher unpleasant side this ambition it is subject i have often wondered about because ceo where i work is his sixties but is still working active making hundreds thousands each day with shares movements deals what makes him keep going when he could clearly just pack it buy island sit it well whatever it is it is probably same motivation that got him position he is i am not any way aligning two men but with there will be blood this is very much crux film as it is character piece looking at plainview this regard way it does it is with patience intelligence so that it is never matter one act that pushes him too far or one moment that flicks switch within him but rather that it is simple logical totally natural this character i do think that conclusion perhaps could have been better but otherwise it is faultless piece work visually film is striking not any one image or moment style though but endlessly eye catching framing shots or positioning camera canvas western is course present but we are never staring at it somehow even as two characters greet each other by pipe being buried against wide horizon we are still focused tiny characters lot this has do with utterly convincing performance daniel day lewis it has been said loads but i cannot help but repeat how good it is again it is not down one moment that can be used as clip oscars but rather complete immersion character so that he is able convince whether as man starting out or man who is at end his life no matter how impressive visuals you never take your eyes him me he is whole film support cast do struggle by being his shadow certain extent but mostly they all still work dano is probably secondary most important character piece he does pretty well with it although he doesnt really seem age across film which i found distracting detracting his work along with visual structure use music is impressive never forcing its way over action only ever being part what is happening it is academys loss that they couldnt recognise score because absence this film makes them look daft indeed hindsight so does dominance at awards no country old men it should have been more even split because they are both very good very thoughtful films although me there will be blood has it over cohens here ok it is not as entertaining or as accessible film as that thriller but it is much more engaging interesting what it does script through acting filming scoring total delivery it is magnificent film,0.47502919955861134,0.1931089466089466,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.49}"
4.0,I'm jumping OFF this band wagon in confusion and surprise?! There 'Will' Be a lot of things...entertainment wasn't one of them,"I can say that 'usually' I am pretty on par with what the general public think of a movie although I have been known to stray my own way with certain films but I am still blown away in reading all the reviews for this film which would have someone believe that this is one of the best films of the year...an opinion shared overwhelmingly with the Academy who has bestowed numerous Oscar nominations on this film so let me be the first to say that perhaps my opinion is not right this time. However, it is my opinion and I was blown away by how truly outrageously BORING and misrepresented this movie is. I don't consider myself unintelligent by any means. I think I can certainly enjoy a great intellectual, artistic picture, and I DO love a great historical epic but I had seen the previews for this film and they represent it completely different than what the film is. There Will Be Blood should have been titled by its origin of work which was ""Oil"" because that is the only thing this film is about. I get the title...its rags to riches, pulling himself from the very bottom through turbulence and trials and ends with him losing his mind basically but my god it takes him a long time to get there and everything in the middle is as boring as the sand around him.Daniel Day-Lewis is very good. I take nothing from his performance as Oil man Daniel Plainview who starts from nothing and ultimately creates an empire at no expense including his own sanity in the end. Considering his character arc covers many years and many different situations, he does a terrific job. Its just the fact that there isn't any real plot or point to the three hour film to help support him. He definitely is the focus of the film despite a small supporting cast. The only other stand out performance is that of Paul Dano, a very gifted actor coming from an awesome role in Little Miss Sunshine. His over the top, bursting performance as religious fanatic and 'healer' Eli Sunday is really something. Its comical in this dark and disturbing way. However the previews of this film imply some sort of great battle of wits between Sunday and Plainview which never happens. Instead Eli Sunday is like an annoying little bug which Plainview swats repeatedly. Dillon Freasier also does a decent job as young H.W. Plainview, who is learning the business from his father until an accident takes his hearing. Its a subtle and quiet performance but he does well.So you have these good performances, why did I dislike this movie? It is truly uneventful. I mean watching the Oil fields and the events surrounding drilling and making money is very captivating...for 30 maybe 40 minutes...but NOTHING else happens. Its the same for three hours! And then when all is said and done we have this emotional blow out between father and son after years of being apart and then the end of the film is so downright stupid and ludicrous, it just literally made me shake my head. In some ways it was the perfect ending to a film that was just a waste. I DO believe the film makers purposely mislead the general public to believe that this film is about this bloody battle between and Oil Driller and a preacher when it has nothing at all to do with that. I can't agree with anyone on this and seeing the words ""astounding, gory, disturbing"" in people's reviews make me say ""What the hell were you all watching?"" I literally had to fight to keep my eyes open. But to each their own...that's the beauty of art but for me this Academy Awards is shaping out to be a big disappointment. 4/10",im jumping off this band wagon confusion surprise there will be lot things entertainment wasnt one them,i can say that usually i am pretty par with what general public think movie although i have been known stray my own way with certain films but i am still blown away reading all reviews this film which would have someone believe that this is one best films year opinion shared overwhelmingly with academy who has bestowed numerous oscar nominations this film so let me be first say that perhaps my opinion is not right this time however it is my opinion i was blown away by how truly outrageously boring misrepresented this movie is i dont consider myself unintelligent by any means i think i can certainly enjoy great intellectual artistic picture i do love great historical epic but i had seen previews this film they represent it completely different than what film is there will be blood should have been titled by its origin work which was oil because that is only thing this film is about i get title its rags riches pulling himself very bottom through turbulence trials ends with him losing his mind basically but my god it takes him long time get there everything middle is as boring as sand around him daniel day lewis is very good i take nothing his performance as oil man daniel plainview who starts nothing ultimately creates empire at no expense including his own sanity end considering his character arc covers many years many different situations he does terrific job its just fact that there isnt any real plot or point three hour film help support him he definitely is focus film despite small supporting cast only other stand out performance is that paul dano very gifted actor coming awesome role little miss sunshine his over top bursting performance as religious fanatic healer eli sunday is really something its comical this dark disturbing way however previews this film imply some sort great battle wits between sunday plainview which never happens instead eli sunday is like annoying little bug which plainview swats repeatedly dillon freasier also does decent job as young h w plainview who is learning business his father until accident takes his hearing its subtle quiet performance but he does well so you have these good performances why did i dislike this movie it is truly uneventful i mean watching oil fields events surrounding drilling making money is very captivating 30 maybe 40 minutes but nothing else happens its same three hours then when all is said done we have this emotional blow out between father son after years being apart then end film is so downright stupid ludicrous it just literally made me shake my head some ways it was perfect ending film that was just waste i do believe film makers purposely mislead general public believe that this film is about this bloody battle between oil driller preacher when it has nothing at all do with that i cant agree with anyone this seeing words astounding gory disturbing peoples reviews make me say what hell were you all watching i literally had fight keep my eyes open but each their own thats beauty art but me this academy awards is shaping out be big disappointment 4 10,0.6147474259974259,0.0998053410553411,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.28}"
3.0,One-dimensional portrait of American businessman,"I haven't read Upton Sinclair's ""Oil"" which ""There will be blood"" is based on but I understand that the main character in the movie is depicted as being far more demonic than the character shown in the book. So apparently it's the screenwriter who we can heap scorn upon here and not the novelist responsible for the original source material.Paul Thomas Anderson, the screenwriter, has borrowed a page from the second half of ""Citizen Kane"" where a multi-dimensional character suddenly morphs into a one-dimensional bad guy. But in ""There will be Blood"", our anti-hero, Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is one-dimensional throughout! There seems to be a mantra uttered these days that Day-Lewis's performance is a masterpiece and he deserves the Oscar. Except for a few dramatic angry outbursts, Day-Lewis's performance appears to me as entirely one-note! That's really the fault of the screenwriter, who believes in the ""I'm not OKyou're not OK"" school of screen writing. Make your character someone who openly admits that he has contempt for everybody and also (unconsciously) dislikes himself. Anderson's Plainview is a metaphor for big business past and present. It's a puerile view of American business and American businessmen since no one is like that in real life. Evil characters need to have likable and hence charismatic characteristicsthey attain their objectives by seducing their constituents (e.g. Tony Soprano). One wonders how such a surly and nasty character as Plainview actually succeeds. Notice how the peripheral characters in this film have virtually nothing to saythey are completely underdeveloped. The screenwriter is content to explore only his relationships with three main characters, his son, Eli, the minister and his pseudo half-brother (who he ends up killing after he realizes that the man is really a con artist). One wonders why Plainview has to be so demonic and unlikable. Would a person whose main goal is to be successful jeopardize his entire career by murdering the man who pretended to be his brother? Would a person who purportedly did everything for his handicapped son throughout the boy's childhood suddenly turn around and disown him simply because he wants to move away with his wife and start his own company in Mexico? And finally, does it make ANY SENSE AT ALL that he would risk imprisonment by murdering the minister who comes begging to him after he's lost all his money in the stock market crash? I understand that Plainview was getting back at Eli for humiliating him after he was forced to undergo Baptism in order to lease the land from one of the parishioners, but to suddenly murder the fellow with a bowling pin at the end made no sense at all!""There will be blood"" is melodrama which descends into cheap propaganda. While Daniel Day-Lewis will probably win for best actor (and I don't think he should), my prediction is that this picture will not win the Oscar. The truth of the matter is that it's too much of a downerand downers don't win Oscars!",one dimensional portrait american businessman,i havent read upton sinclairs oil which there will be blood is based but i understand that main character movie is depicted as being far more demonic than character shown book so apparently its screenwriter who we can heap scorn upon here not novelist responsible original source material paul thomas anderson screenwriter has borrowed page second half citizen kane where multi dimensional character suddenly morphs into one dimensional bad guy but there will be blood our anti hero daniel plainview played by daniel day lewis is one dimensional throughout there seems be mantra uttered these days that day lewiss performance is masterpiece he deserves oscar except few dramatic angry outbursts day lewiss performance appears me as entirely one note thats really fault screenwriter who believes im not ok youre not ok school screen writing make your character someone who openly admits that he has contempt everybody also unconsciously dislikes himself andersons plainview is metaphor big business past present its puerile view american business american businessmen since no one is like that real life evil characters need have likable hence charismatic characteristics they attain their objectives by seducing their constituents e g tony soprano one wonders how such surly nasty character as plainview actually succeeds notice how peripheral characters this film have virtually nothing say they are completely underdeveloped screenwriter is content explore only his relationships with three main characters his son eli minister his pseudo half brother who he ends up killing after he realizes that man is really con artist one wonders why plainview has be so demonic unlikable would person whose main goal is be successful jeopardize his entire career by murdering man who pretended be his brother would person who purportedly did everything his handicapped son throughout boys childhood suddenly turn around disown him simply because he wants move away with his wife start his own company mexico finally does it make any sense at all that he would risk imprisonment by murdering minister who comes begging him after hes lost all his money stock market crash i understand that plainview was getting back at eli humiliating him after he was forced undergo baptism order lease land one parishioners but suddenly murder fellow with bowling pin at end made no sense at all there will be blood is melodrama which descends into cheap propaganda while daniel day lewis will probably win best actor i dont think he should my prediction is that this picture will not win oscar truth matter is that its too much downer downers dont win oscars,0.43558441558441546,0.05196969696969697,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"
2.0,And I thought Andy Warhol's movies were slow.,"About ten minutes into this film-- that's only one scene in Paul Thomas Anderson's world-- somebody in the audience said, aloud, ""We get it, already. Digging oil wells is dangerous."" Anderson never directed a crisp, concise scene in his life. ""Boogie Nights"" (155 minutes), ""Magnolia"" (188m), ""There Will be Blood"" (158m)-- that's 8.5 hours for three movies. And before someone points out that ""Punch Drunk Love"" was only 95 minutes, I would counter that it felt twice that. At least.Pascal wrote, ""I am sorry for the length of my letter, but I had not the time to write a short one."" Amen. It does take time-- and talent and discipline-- to sculpt and winnow an idea down to its most purposeful and powerful elements. But Anderson doesn't winnow, he wallows. He seems to think that if a four-minute scene is good, then it'll be twice as good at eight minutes, and three times as good at twelve. It's a wonder his movies aren't six hours long.The best way to deal with this endlessly over-rated film is with adjectives, starting with endless and over-rated. Then, of course, bloated. Slow. Fatuous. Loud. Unfaithful (to Upton Sinclair's original satire, ""Oil!""). Sentimental. Confusing (Paul Dano's twin characters). Abrupt (the ending). And, finally and crucially, pointless.

9.0,Milkshake?,"You can criticize this film at points, but the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing. He certainly has made a career of being menacing. His very presence commands the screen. The sociopath that he plays here is one of those, taking everything he can, having no regrets for his cruelty at any point. He does betray his son and still blames anyone who mentions him, assuming they are judging him. They have every right to. It's interesting that it isn't just the righteous who land on their feet. Daniel is willing to do anything to get what he wants. His passions and obsessions are right there. Anyone who hooks up with him has to know that they are simply pawns in the game. This film is filled with memorable scenes and subtle threat. Levi, the minister, is certainly quite complex and as ambitious as Daniel. His pliable face works for me, though some say he is too whiny and obvious. To me, this is what would work in this setting. For most of the movie he is Daniel's equal in the role of charlatan. The bowling alley scene at the end is worth the price of admission.",milkshake,you can criticize this film at points but performance daniel day lewis is astonishing he certainly has made career being menacing his very presence commands screen sociopath that he plays here is one those taking everything he can having no regrets his cruelty at any point he does betray his son still blames anyone who mentions him assuming they are judging him they have every right its interesting that it isnt just righteous who land their feet daniel is willing do anything get what he wants his passions obsessions are right there anyone who hooks up with him has know that they are simply pawns game this film is filled with memorable scenes subtle threat levi minister is certainly quite complex as ambitious as daniel his pliable face works me though some say he is too whiny obvious me this is what would work this setting most movie he is daniels equal role charlatan bowling alley scene at end is worth price admission,0.5327922077922077,0.11893939393939391,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.48}"
,Stunning,"This film raises the game for everyone out there. I have loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, including his greatly underrated Punch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previous movies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of this film is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which feature virtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood's score, which I have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me (and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its most experimental). Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is in a league of its own: his voice, his mannerisms, his physical movement, his stunted emotions, are flesh and blood, and hauntingly so, in a way that even Tommy Lee Jones in In The Valley of Elah (which I thought was a pretty staggering performance) can't quite attain. I will watch this film again and again simply to see something so raw and so moving and so gut-wrenching. This is why I love movies; this is what made me want to make movies when I was fourteen years old.",stunning,this film raises game everyone out there i have loved all paul thomas andersons work including his greatly underrated punch drunk love but this is huge leap any previous movies into realm as others have said inhabited by classics such as treasure sierra madre then some every element this film is astonishing opening twenty minutes which feature virtually no dialog jonny greenwoods score which i have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect me brings mind non blue danube elements 2001 at its most experimental daniel day lewis performance is league its own his voice his mannerisms his physical movement his stunted emotions are flesh blood hauntingly so way that even tommy lee jones valley elah which i thought was pretty staggering performance cant quite attain i will watch this film again again simply see something so raw so moving so gut wrenching this is why i love movies this is what made me want make movies when i was fourteen years old,0.6132478632478632,0.24536019536019532,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.18}"
10.0,The most flamboyant portrayal of materialism and its alienating effect ...,"It's about expansion, it's about capitalism, and whatever that caused the demise of the Wild West myth. ""There Will be Blood"" looks, smell, feels like a Western but this is an Anti-Western more than anything  There's so much to say about this movie but it left me speechless at the end, Daniel Day-Lewis was hypnotic, giving a performance that reminded me of Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane"", and Humphrey Bogart in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" ... He's definitely one of the greatest actors of his generation, especially in this performance that probably best defines the alienating effect of materialism. The 40's had Charles Foster Kane, the 80's had Gordon Gekko and the 2000's have Daniel Planview.Indeed, ""There Will be Blood"" is not your typical 'soul corrupted by money and/or power' drama, as I said, it's all about materialism, ending with a pocket filled by gold and a heart made of the same stone you've been working on all your life, it's trusting anything that has a specific color, a specific smell, working on a land to find a greasy black liquid gushing from its womb, and never, never trusting or giving any credit to ""nothingness"" or ""abstraction"".Daniel Plainview considers these abstractions with the most profound disdain. Nothing is free, nothing comes from nothing, nothing is unsubstantial. If one claims to be your brother, he has to prove it, if one should make a deal with you, he should talk business and not about education ... not because it's personal, not because it has nothing to do with business, BUT because it is NOTHING and nothingness irritates Plainview as if the only thing he could believe on had to be material. The rest is nothing, feelings are nothing, believing is nothing, these so strong and noble words for us, well, Plainview doesn't give a damn about them...And more than anything, above all these abstractions, there is religion, God is Daniel Plainview's archenemy  this is the ultimate masquerade for him, the cancer that gangrenes the progress, an evil that transforms people into sheep, almost like animals, the biggest hypocrisy of all  Plainview, the capitalist, almost shares the same opinion than Marx who thought religion was people's opium. And because Plainview despises this hypocrisy, he tries to exorcise his hatred by using religion to achieve his plans, exploiting it, like he exploited his adopted son. No feelings, no sentiments, everything should serve a palpable purpose. The end justifies the means.And ultimately, he gets rich at the end, he's a respected and feared tycoon, as the purest and most implacable illustration of the American dream. But is he happy? no! because power, prosperity, those are still empty words ... he believes in material, in things, in stuff he drinks like the iconic 'milk-shake' metaphor that still resonates in my mind as one of the most memorable hymns to greed and pragmatism. Plainview is greedy, but not evil, evil is still too abstract a word; because it implies the use of one own conscience while Plainview's conscience was dedicated to one goal: getting bigger, possession, expansion, territoriality.And are we to blame him? Let's not forget the bleak cinematography at the beginning of the film where we could feel, the stink of the oil, the hardness of the rocks and the land as an incontrollable enemy ... let's not forget that Plainview spent half of his life stuck alone into dark holes made of land, stone, metal, oil, and raw matter, so close he could almost feel them, so close it became a part of him ...""There Will Be Blood"" is the quintessential film about materialism and its alienating power, when all that matters is matter!",most flamboyant portrayal materialism its alienating effect,its about expansion its about capitalism whatever that caused demise wild west myth there will be blood looks smell feels like western but this is anti western more than anything theres so much say about this movie but it left me speechless at end daniel day lewis was hypnotic giving performance that reminded me orson welles citizen kane humphrey bogart treasure sierra madre hes definitely one greatest actors his generation especially this performance that probably best defines alienating effect materialism 40s had charles foster kane 80s had gordon gekko 2000s have daniel planview indeed there will be blood is not your typical soul corrupted by money or power drama as i said its all about materialism ending with pocket filled by gold heart made same stone youve been working all your life its trusting anything that has specific color specific smell working land find greasy black liquid gushing its womb never never trusting or giving any credit nothingness or abstraction daniel plainview considers these abstractions with most profound disdain nothing is free nothing comes nothing nothing is unsubstantial if one claims be your brother he has prove it if one should make deal with you he should talk business not about education not because its personal not because it has nothing do with business but because it is nothing nothingness irritates plainview as if only thing he could believe had be material rest is nothing feelings are nothing believing is nothing these so strong noble words us well plainview doesnt give damn about them more than anything above all these abstractions there is religion god is daniel plainviews archenemy this is ultimate masquerade him cancer that gangrenes progress evil that transforms people into sheep almost like animals biggest hypocrisy all plainview capitalist almost shares same opinion than marx who thought religion was peoples opium because plainview despises this hypocrisy he tries exorcise his hatred by using religion achieve his plans exploiting it like he exploited his adopted son no feelings no sentiments everything should serve palpable purpose end justifies means ultimately he gets rich at end hes respected feared tycoon as purest most implacable illustration american dream but is he happy no because power prosperity those are still empty words he believes material things stuff he drinks like iconic milk shake metaphor that still resonates my mind as one most memorable hymns greed pragmatism plainview is greedy but not evil evil is still too abstract word because it implies use one own conscience while plainviews conscience was dedicated one goal getting bigger possession expansion territoriality are we blame him lets not forget bleak cinematography at beginning film where we could feel stink oil hardness rocks land as incontrollable enemy lets not forget that plainview spent half his life stuck alone into dark holes made land stone metal oil raw matter so close he could almost feel them so close it became part him there will be blood is quintessential film about materialism its alienating power when all that matters is matter,0.5335552268244577,0.10405571992110453,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.38}"
