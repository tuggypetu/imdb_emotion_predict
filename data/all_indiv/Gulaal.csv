10.0,Cinema par excellence!,"Anurag Kashyap rightly said that 'Gulaal' is his most angry film yet. 8 years in the making, Gulaal lacked salability due to its lack of stars, bold and convoluted story and the controversy surrounding Kashyap's initial works – 'Black Friday' and 'Paanch'. But here it is now, what can be touted as his best work till date, the film that relates to today's India with the ambitions of the pragmatic youth confronting the deceptive, greedy and zealous hypocrites who breed malice and violence in the name of deeply rooted values. This engaging battle has been brilliantly crafted by Kashyap with an exhaustive script and screenplay that not only amplify a convoluted plot but do justice to the multitude of highly talented actors. Mind you.. 'Actors', and not heroes. But even more than these essential elements is the contribution of one man whose soul stirring lyrics, beautiful compositions, didactic and engaging dialogs and an awesome performance in a supporting role move you if not enchant you. Piyush Mishra, who was so far a theater actor in Delhi is thus a revelation of astounding talents.Gulaal is a socio-political drama about the President of the Rajputana community who is uniting his people against the injustice that has been inflicted upon them over the years by the government of the very democracy that their ancestors had once fought to gain. Dukey Bana (Kay Kay Menon) is a powerful icon among the Rajputs who strives to bring a new student in law college, Dileep Singh (Raj Singh Chaudhary) at the helm of college politics. Dileep has just walked into this lawless world of autocratic cruelty that has no mercy for the weak or innocent and thus begins his study of law. Dileep, being the righteous individual who does not share the vision of Bana and his supporters is often caught in an emotional turmoil when he wants to be rebellious, but the power in the hands of the mighty tend to vanquish every uprising against them and so he battles his own cowardice and naivety among the radicals. Some vital characters form the true essence of the film's plot that revolves around love, betrayal, politics, deception, greed, hypocrisy and of course, the ultimate fight to gain power. Supporting this endeavor are Deepak Dobriyal, Abhimanyu Singh, Aditya Shrivastava, Mahie Gill and Ayesha Mohan in well etched out characters. Kay Kay Menon is at his wicked best but with reserved intensity that goes full blast during his speeches or confrontations with his brother or Dileep. Raj Singh Chaudhary has been around in small roles but this film will slingshot him to recognition if not stardom for his natural ability to portray himself as the innocent and vulnerable Dileep Singh whose journey through the tyrannies of cruelty, violence, betrayal and hypocrisy elevate him to becoming an uncompromising individual. Piyush Mishra's character is the film's poetic narrator. His presence on screen is less cinematic and more theatrical and the distinction is evident when comparing with the rest. Apart from being the song writer, music director and singer for Gulaal, Piyush Mishra is also the dialog writer and wisely has he kept the best ones for his part. In fact, every time Prithvi Bana comes on screen, his dialog and message have a deeper connotation which will make you think for days. Listen intently to 'Sarforishi Ki tamanna' being adapted to current times as he calls upon Bismil to take a look at today's state of affairs. Watch him mimic Dukey Bana's mission to claim the state of 'Rajputana'while also denouncing the plan while singing 'sale hai! Sale hai!' . These are powerful scenes that have exemplary direction, screenplay and dialog with equally astounding performances. The film's music is par excellence. Seldom have we seen or heard songs so timely in the screenplay, so soulful in meaning and so rich in language. 'Beeda' is classic folklore sung so well by Rekha Bhardwaj. 'Aaarambh hai prachand' is a song denoting a strong initiation and so it very much is in the story as the entire election campaign in the college is executed during the song which gives us a deeper insight into battle and victory. 'Shehar' is perhaps the film's best song with its lyrics flowing through every scene that it runs with. The evil times in the city could not have a better narration. Piyush Mishra's all-round deliverance in this song with Anurag's execution of the screenplay makes this song a spectacle in itself. The hilarious 'Ranaji' teases with references to international terror acts. Shilpa Rao's mesmerizing rendition of 'Aisi saza' is truly representative of the emotions after betrayal. 'Yaara Maula' is a deep, soul stirring composition of evil taking over innocence in its most vulnerable state. Once again, the story leaps forward with the simple play of lyrics that translate the emotional turmoil. The movie ends with 'Duniya', the epitome of Piyush Mishra's talent showcase. 'Yeh Duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai' sums up what the movie had to say. The final scenes shall give you the chills with the outstanding lyrics playing for the conclusion. Gulaal is a very impressive piece of cinema that will be cherished by only a few due to its unconventional story telling. It is a dark and evil tale of India itself. As we progress in these times with our ambitious goals, we are often obstructed by our culture, history and orthodox values and Gulaal shows us a shockingly real picture of that confrontation. It is time we adopt this kind of cinema with the richness that it has in its script, screenplay, lyrics, dialogs, performances and Anurag Kashyap's relentless pursuit of his vision.9.34 on a scale of

10.0,the maverick director is up-to it again !!,"just moments after seeing the movie, I am speechless about it. A pretty heavy, engrossing and brain-consuming movie, its definitely not for the casual cinema-goers. For the more adventurous or socially opinionated people, its worth a watch. personally, i'd watch it over again, being a brilliant take on manipulative politics. One may compare it with other movies based on politics, but the major difference in this is that it relates with the simple minded, down to earth common man and how certain events can bring a destructive change in his mentality.Set in a topical theme of Rajasthani traditions, it sets an account of how a straightforward, common, hard working man faces challenges of the grim modern world. The theme is engrossingly fast, manipulative and gripping (provided you don't expect an action filled murder mystery). So much being said and shown in the movie in so less a time, makes your brain racing on the heels of the movie.Apart from the story line, the other most credulous thing about the movie is its ensemble cast. the only famous star, Kay Kay shines with his aggressive attitude perfectly. The main protagonist makes a stark resemblance with the innocence of superman's parallel life as a worker newspaper company.Another very important positive are the songs (not all but some of them). Using old classics like 'Yeh Duniya Agar Mil Bhi Jaaye To ..' and Indian Bhajan's/Patriotic numbers and mixing them to make them relevant to the movie is a brave attempt, which has surely paid off for Anurag Kashyap.Though my only worry about the movie is that for which kind of audience is such a movie prepared ?",maverick director is up it again,just moments after seeing movie i am speechless about it pretty heavy engrossing brain consuming movie its definitely not casual cinema goers more adventurous or socially opinionated people its worth watch personally id watch it over again being brilliant take manipulative politics one may compare it with other movies based politics but major difference this is that it relates with simple minded down earth common man how certain events can bring destructive change his mentality set topical theme rajasthani traditions it sets account how straightforward common hard working man faces challenges grim modern world theme is engrossingly fast manipulative gripping provided you dont expect action filled murder mystery so much being said shown movie so less time makes your brain racing heels movie apart story line other most credulous thing about movie is its ensemble cast only famous star kay kay shines with his aggressive attitude perfectly main protagonist makes stark resemblance with innocence supermans parallel life as worker newspaper company another very important positive are songs not all but some them using old classics like yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye indian bhajans patriotic numbers mixing them make them relevant movie is brave attempt which has surely paid off anurag kashyap though my only worry about movie is that which kind audience is such movie prepared,0.5667067500400833,0.14300376783710117,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.51}"
9.0,A Movie Well Worth Watching.,"A political thriller set against background of college in the Indian city of Jaipur in the state of Rajasthan as an intriguing and an interesting factor itself. What makes it more interesting is the plot itself and more so when an innocent student goes there to study and gets involved with a woman who seems to be innocent but is, in reality, is a bitter pill.Co  written and directed by Anurag Kashyap and written by Raja Choudhary, this thriller genre movie, stars Kay Kay Menon, Raja Chaudhary, Jesse Randhwa, Deepak Dobriyal, Ayesha Mohan, Mahie Gill, Piyush Mishra and Abhimanyu Singh.This is the second thriller that has been released this year and again it starred Kay Kay Menon and once again, he has stolen ""the show."" Ayesha Mohan is also on the same route as Kay Kay Menon but not as much.

8.0,Lost Glory and Misguided Beliefs,"Anurag Kashyap may well be the fountainhead that lets Bollywood finally get back on its feet. After the indie movement in the 80's, the Shah rukhs and the Salmans took over....and thus followed years of mindless duds.Gulaal tells the story of a Rajput boy losing his innocence in the murky world of politics and betrayal. Interwoven with this are tales of deception, greed and apathy for mankind.What happened in Rajasthan years ago makes it a perfect backdrop for this tale and the clever use of lyrics also let Kashyap rant about all that is going wrong in the world.Gulaal, much like Kashyap's other film makes the viewer think long after the movie has ended. There are no definite endings and characters cannot be labeled as good or bad.Even if you are a fan of mainstream bubblegum Bollywood, this movie deserves a dekko for the performances alone. Kay Kay has never shone brighter, Abhimanyu Singh leaps ahead of the pack and the Raj Singh shows a lot of promise.I like my share of masala ficks, but this isn't Bollywood...this is Indian Cinema at its best....a must watch",lost glory misguided beliefs,anurag kashyap may well be fountainhead that lets bollywood finally get back its feet after indie movement 80s shah rukhs salmans took over thus followed years mindless duds gulaal tells story rajput boy losing his innocence murky world politics betrayal interwoven with this are tales deception greed apathy mankind what happened rajasthan years ago makes it perfect backdrop this tale clever use lyrics also let kashyap rant about all that is going wrong world gulaal much like kashyaps other film makes viewer think long after movie has ended there are no definite endings characters cannot be labeled as good or bad even if you are fan mainstream bubblegum bollywood this movie deserves dekko performances alone kay kay has never shone brighter abhimanyu singh leaps ahead pack raj singh shows lot promise i like my share masala ficks but this isnt bollywood this is indian cinema at its best must watch,0.5482142857142858,0.10654761904761904,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.41, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"Hail Anuraag Kashyap, you are the BEST!!","I think Gulaal is till date is the best movie directed by AK. The movie goes far beyond Maqbool and Omkara, not undermining them, those two were also milestones for contemporary Hindi cinema, but Gulaal was something extraordinary. Each and every character played perfectly, along with the metaphors, it was a perfect sync.This is a wholesome product of an excellent script with the most honest and sincere performances. The beauty of AK is that the movie is not what it seems.. like just like in ""No Smoking""... where its not about smoking but about personal freedom and the surreality surrounding it. Even in Gulaal, one might find the story very political, about the revolution, college elections but NO, its just the backdrop. The main story is how the main protagonist, Dilip's character develops upon that backdrop. How he gets molded by the different personalities that comes in his life, starting from Ransa, Anuja, Duki Bana, Kiran and then his own remorse. If you closely look, each and every character's role stayed the same, Ransa, Anuja, Duki Bana, Kiran, Karan and Bhaati... they all revolved around the development of Dilip which is something amazing.The movie is also about reviving personal identity which was aptly shown by the clever politics of Karan and Kiran. And the movie doesn't stop here, the complex female characters add more color to it. Its such a movie where not even a single moment was wasted or was not required. Starting from Dilip being ragged to Dilip being dead, its those characters, the metaphors, the camera-work, music, everything synced so beautifully, it left me spellbound. Its 3AM here, and I just finished watching it and I just couldn't help myself writing about it. Well done AK as your movies always add a new dimension to the Hindi ""noir"" movie movement.",hail anuraag kashyap you are best,i think gulaal is till date is best movie directed by ak movie goes far beyond maqbool omkara not undermining them those two were also milestones contemporary hindi cinema but gulaal was something extraordinary each every character played perfectly along with metaphors it was perfect sync this is wholesome product excellent script with most honest sincere performances beauty ak is that movie is not what it seems like just like no smoking where its not about smoking but about personal freedom surreality surrounding it even gulaal one might find story very political about revolution college elections but no its just backdrop main story is how main protagonist dilips character develops upon that backdrop how he gets molded by different personalities that comes his life starting ransa anuja duki bana kiran then his own remorse if you closely look each every characters role stayed same ransa anuja duki bana kiran karan bhaati they all revolved around development dilip which is something amazing movie is also about reviving personal identity which was aptly shown by clever politics karan kiran movie doesnt stop here complex female characters add more color it its such movie where not even single moment was wasted or was not required starting dilip being ragged dilip being dead its those characters metaphors camera work music everything synced so beautifully it left me spellbound its 3am here i just finished watching it i just couldnt help myself writing about it well done ak as your movies always add new dimension hindi noir movie movement,0.49567165158074256,0.2837859110586383,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9.0,Mind blowing piece of cinema,Gulaal is a extremely well scripted and characterized piece of cinema. Each and every character is carved brilliantly and the characters are so real and so different from usual flicks. It is a story of a simple and innocent graduate and how his life gets affected by politics and the way it has been shown is simply amazing.I love the way Anurag Kashyap tells the entire story and the music blends effortlessly except the Songs picturised on Mahi Gill. The background score is awesome.Cinematography is amazing and the color red is captured beautifully throughout the movie.Piyush Mishra who has penned the lyrics has done a wonderful job both as a lyricist and music director. Wait that's not all he has also played the role of Prithvi Bana and has done a brilliant job. His dialogues are so bloody good and gets metamorphic at times. All his dialogues are thought provoking and the way he sings in the movie is so different and unusual and impressive as well.Kay Kay Menon has as usual done a wonderful job as a person who is passionate about his history and his background. He speaks flawlessly and lives up to the expectations.Raj Singh Chaudhary has done a good job as a simple and innocent student who gets into the trap of college politics. But somewhere we can that amateurishness in his performance.Ayesha Mohan acted well and may god save men form such women[:D]But the best performance comes from Abhimanyu Shekhar singh as Ranvijay. His dialogues were mind blowing and he enacted the role of a rajput to perfection.Deepak Dobriyal as Bhatti has again lived up to the expectations and his acting looks so real. Jesse Randhawa has done well with whatever she had to do.Mahi Gill was a let down and I expected better performance from her. I found her irritating at times may be because the kind of character she played will definitely irritate me in real life.Final Verdict  A must watch for people who love hard hitting cinema. Its is a bloody awesome movie.,mind blowing piece cinema,gulaal is extremely well scripted characterized piece cinema each every character is carved brilliantly characters are so real so different usual flicks it is story simple innocent graduate how his life gets affected by politics way it has been shown is simply amazing i love way anurag kashyap tells entire story music blends effortlessly except songs picturised mahi gill background score is awesome cinematography is amazing color red is captured beautifully throughout movie piyush mishra who has penned lyrics has done wonderful job both as lyricist music director wait thats not all he has also played role prithvi bana has done brilliant job his dialogues are so bloody good gets metamorphic at times all his dialogues are thought provoking way he sings movie is so different unusual impressive as well kay kay menon has as usual done wonderful job as person who is passionate about his history his background he speaks flawlessly lives up expectations raj singh chaudhary has done good job as simple innocent student who gets into trap college politics but somewhere we can that amateurishness his performance ayesha mohan acted well may god save men form such women but best performance comes abhimanyu shekhar singh as ranvijay his dialogues were mind blowing he enacted role rajput perfection deepak dobriyal as bhatti has again lived up expectations his acting looks so real jesse randhawa has done well with whatever she had do mahi gill was let down i expected better performance her i found her irritating at times may be because kind character she played will definitely irritate me real life final verdict must watch people who love hard hitting cinema its is bloody awesome movie,0.6725544481358435,0.29599483204134364,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.37}"

You may not like the songs without watching the movie. Piyush mishra is a immensely talented actor and to my surprise singer too. The lyrics of the songs sung by him are philosophical and sarcastic at the same time. You may laugh his songs off but it will definitely make you think.

8.0,"A brilliant dark look at politics, love, power....","I say brilliant, because sans that word it would be very difficult to describe this movie with any other adjective. Yes it is dark, it has a lot of parallels to a ""DEV.D"", with gloomy, drugged and unpegionholed characters. But what this movie does, is create this world of politics and love, with untouchable realism. The movie starts with a K K Menon speech, the word speech here is an understatement, the fiery write up and an equally fiery delivery leaves you mesmerized, almost reminiscent of the last rhetoric of KK Menon in ""Shaurya"". The film then goes back a year in time and narrates the transition of a nervous ordinary student, Dileep (Raja Chaudhary), from being a sidekick to Ransa (Abhimanyu Singh) to being a fearless gun wielding spurned lover. A special mention for Abhimanyu Singh's powerful performance, which makes the first half entertaining and gripping. The story revolves on Mritunjay's ( K K Menon) attempt to create a political force for a separatist movement "" Rajputana"" seeking independence as a separate entity. To achieve his objectives he uses everyone as a pawn, from the royalty's money to the student's popularity, in effect leading to the conflicts and rhetoric. Mahi Gill after ""Dev.D"" does a small but great part. There are a lot of characters portrayed in the film and everyone has a story to tell, and all of them have shades of gray, which I think is very typical Anurag Kashyap now. Although some characters and their stories are left incomplete (intentional you would feel), the overall characterization is (at the cost of repeating myself) ""brilliant"". The characters of Anuja and that of the ""Ardha-Nareshwar"" are done very well and add a bit to the overall story; however, at the end, you are left with a feeling of them being nothing more than useless subplots to bring in theatrical effects, again signature Anurag Kashyap. The music complements and in effect adds a lot to this movie. The lyrics are hypnotic, and the beats are very traditional and yet modern. Piyush Mishra, gives a fresh and psychedelic feel to the lyrics. The item numbers of this movie (""Ranaji"" and ""Beedo"") have more poetic brilliance than all the title songs released this year. I am not even going to comment on superb songs like ""Duniya"", ""Aarambh"" or ""Seher"". Overall a must watch (not for the family), if you loved ""Dev.D"" you will surely like this. Though the second half of the film has loose ends and tends to overcomplicate the storyline, it still leaves an indelible mark on your minds, and rattles your thoughts.",brilliant dark look at politics love power,i say brilliant because sans that word it would be very difficult describe this movie with any other adjective yes it is dark it has lot parallels dev d with gloomy drugged unpegionholed characters but what this movie does is create this world politics love with untouchable realism movie starts with k k menon speech word speech here is understatement fiery write up equally fiery delivery leaves you mesmerized almost reminiscent last rhetoric kk menon shaurya film then goes back year time narrates transition nervous ordinary student dileep raja chaudhary being sidekick ransa abhimanyu singh being fearless gun wielding spurned lover special mention abhimanyu singhs powerful performance which makes first half entertaining gripping story revolves mritunjays k k menon attempt create political force separatist movement rajputana seeking independence as separate entity achieve his objectives he uses everyone as pawn royaltys money students popularity effect leading conflicts rhetoric mahi gill after dev d does small but great part there are lot characters portrayed film everyone has story tell all them have shades gray which i think is very typical anurag kashyap now although some characters their stories are left incomplete intentional you would feel overall characterization is at cost repeating myself brilliant characters anuja that ardha nareshwar are done very well add bit overall story however at end you are left with feeling them being nothing more than useless subplots bring theatrical effects again signature anurag kashyap music complements effect adds lot this movie lyrics are hypnotic beats are very traditional yet modern piyush mishra gives fresh psychedelic feel lyrics item numbers this movie ranaji beedo have more poetic brilliance than all title songs released this year i am not even going comment superb songs like duniya aarambh or seher overall must watch not family if you loved dev d you will surely like this though second half film has loose ends tends overcomplicate storyline it still leaves indelible mark your minds rattles your thoughts,0.4662018537018538,0.1813686313686314,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,Anurag Kashyap Movie Through and Through!!,"Anurag Kashyap always tries to push the envelope of Indian cinema with every movie that he directs. Gulaal is a movie set in Rajasthan which focuses on the Rajputs and their actions. As Dilip Kumar, Raj Singh Chaudhary gives a powerful performance and his transformation from a shy, meek boy to a ruthless murderer is chilling. The whole cast is good which lends credibility to the characters portrayed in the movie. Its only fault is that it can be a bit difficult to follow the plot which is ingenious. Also, it is hard to justify some of the actions performed by the main characters that includes using guns disproportionately. The film is unlikely to resonate with the regular cinema-goers.

9.0,One of the best of the decade!!!,"Gulaal is a work of genius and there are two of them involved. Anurag Kashyap is obviously one with wonderful art direction and camera angles / perspectives that no Karan Johar or Aditya Chopra could ever think of. In Gulaal he makes an angry, gritty film with a storyline incredibly unique and a cast and treatment worthy of Hazaar Oscars. The Plot :The film is set in the city of Rajpur, Rajasthan where Rajputs rule the roost and a defunct kings' son dreams of having a land of their own (Rajputana). Caught in this quagmire are two young guys. A simple scared rajput boy Dileep (Raja Chowdhary) and his royal blood friend Ransa (a superb Abhimanyu Singh). When one of them gets seriously ragged by a bunch of hostel goons, a local gangeteresque Rajput Dukey Bana (KK) incites them to fight the university elections. His motive is to get more money and enlist more men in his war for a free Rajasthan.Further sub plots reveal an illegitimate son and daughter of Ransa's King father who are scheming to be recognized as royal blood. A distraught humiliated teacher (Jesse Randhawa) looking for redemption and a dance girl (Mahi Gill) romancing Dukey Bana. Anurag Kashyap mixes these premises with a contemporary feel and art directs to the key. The Other Genius :The other genius of the film is Piyush Mishra. His dialogs, lyrics and modern day satirical shaairyi are the best produced maybe ever. Not to mention his own acting as a John Lennon worshipping elder Rajput Prtihvi Bana who imagines there will be peace and satirizes through the film with a rather weird homosexual half painted mime 'Ardh Nareshwar'.The beauty of Anurag Kahsyap movies is that he keeps bringing into limelight some hard core awesome talent. Talent, which would never be recognized through the dynastic web of Bollywood and considerably dumbed down and sold out Khans.He introduced Amit Trivedi in DEV D and now Piyush Mishra in Gulaal, without who's work each film could have been dismissed as easily as Kashyap's earlier 'No Smoking' wasThe Cast:The ensemble cast also delivers Kay Kay Menon hits home as usual as the all-powerful Dukey Bana who dreams of a separate state of Rajasthan. As does, Aditya Srivastava, as the scheming bastard child of the king. Raja Chaudhary as the reluctant normal guy is super convincing for what is a complex character A Must mention of Ayesha Mohan as a super cute 'Pink Floyd' strumming femme fa-tale who plays the main pawn in the game of manipulative politics But ultimately the guys who steal scenes remain the loyal right hand guy Bhati (Deepak Dobriyal) - , the band master dressed royal Prithvi Bana (Piyush mishra) and a really Rajput like Ransa ( a balls in mouth Abhimanyu Singh)One thing I did not like: The film could have been more crisp, the characters of Mahie Gill and Jesse Randhawa did not really gel with the plot and the almost insane actions of one character towards the end were a little hard to digest. It appears somebody was in a hurry to release the film. Yet I would go on to say that this is Indian Cinema is at its best and yet it appears far from what Anurag Kahsyap can actually achieve!! The word of caution is for the public and more importantly Indian Cinema, ignore this stuff at your own risk!!",one best decade,gulaal is work genius there are two them involved anurag kashyap is obviously one with wonderful art direction camera angles perspectives that no karan johar or aditya chopra could ever think gulaal he makes angry gritty film with storyline incredibly unique cast treatment worthy hazaar oscars plot film is set city rajpur rajasthan where rajputs rule roost defunct kings son dreams having land their own rajputana caught this quagmire are two young guys simple scared rajput boy dileep raja chowdhary his royal blood friend ransa superb abhimanyu singh when one them gets seriously ragged by bunch hostel goons local gangeteresque rajput dukey bana kk incites them fight university elections his motive is get more money enlist more men his war free rajasthan further sub plots reveal illegitimate son daughter ransas king father who are scheming be recognized as royal blood distraught humiliated teacher jesse randhawa looking redemption dance girl mahi gill romancing dukey bana anurag kashyap mixes these premises with contemporary feel art directs key other genius other genius film is piyush mishra his dialogs lyrics modern day satirical shaairyi are best produced maybe ever not mention his own acting as john lennon worshipping elder rajput prtihvi bana who imagines there will be peace satirizes through film with rather weird homosexual half painted mime ardh nareshwar beauty anurag kahsyap movies is that he keeps bringing into limelight some hard core awesome talent talent which would never be recognized through dynastic web bollywood considerably dumbed down sold out khans he introduced amit trivedi dev d now piyush mishra gulaal without whos work each film could have been dismissed as easily as kashyaps earlier no smoking wasthe cast ensemble cast also delivers kay kay menon hits home as usual as all powerful dukey bana who dreams separate state rajasthan as does aditya srivastava as scheming bastard child king raja chaudhary as reluctant normal guy is super convincing what is complex character must mention ayesha mohan as super cute pink floyd strumming femme fa tale who plays main pawn game manipulative politics but ultimately guys who steal scenes remain loyal right hand guy bhati deepak dobriyal band master dressed royal prithvi bana piyush mishra really rajput like ransa balls mouth abhimanyu singh one thing i did not like film could have been more crisp characters mahie gill jesse randhawa did not really gel with plot almost insane actions one character towards end were little hard digest it appears somebody was hurry release film yet i would go say that this is indian cinema is at its best yet it appears far what anurag kahsyap can actually achieve word caution is public more importantly indian cinema ignore this stuff at your own risk,0.5956733230926778,0.1666826676907322,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.37}"
6.0,A Critique's Delight may be but its confusion for the common viewer.,"Delivering what was expected, here is another quality abstract art movie from Anurag Kashyap. And as the case always is, the movie may win over the critiques but it fails to make a direct contact with the common man coming in theaters for entertainment. Anurag is brilliant in his own form of film-making and will definitely satisfy his fan following, which has reached a higher graph after ""Dev-D"", but on the entertainment quotient movie scores quite low.The movie puts an intense, dark, disturbing and even shocking portrayal of College Politics in Rajasthan locales but lacks the depth we had seen in ""Haasil"". The sequences are all well conceived, intelligently directed and superbly shot capable of satisfying the thinking viewers in a big way. On the other hand, for the people coming in looking for the comic factor equivalent to ""Dev-D"" may find it disappointing on that track. This time, Anurag strictly sticks to the intense narration in the complete movie with no relief moment at all.The story revolves around young college students who become victim of cruel local politics and it also has an angle of conspiracy being planned against the government by the Rajput families. The first half shows the rusty college campus in Rajasthan, still obsessed with brutal ragging of new students and even lady teachers. It reveals the youth election back-up sources, which include still called Maharajas, local politicians and a hidden Rajputana rebellion force. Later the emphasis shifts to how a brother uses his sister in getting his due name, respect and leadership. Anurag clearly shows how a female character can win anyone and anything in the world if she is willing to forget her dignity and limits. He represents the power of woman in the man's world in his own unique and captivating way.In the acting department, the best comes from Abhimanyu Singh as Ransa and Ayesha Mohan as Kiran. Ahimanyu though dies in the first hour only but has the power to light up the screen with his presence. Kiran gives an impressive performance as the girl using her feminist qualities in the best possible manner. Pankaj Jha as Jadhwal, Deepak Dobriyal as Bhaatti and Raj Singh as Dilip are effective. Kay Kay and Aditya Srivastav are first rate as always. Two characters who stay in your mind are Piyush Mishra as the mentally retarded elder brother of Kay Kay and Jesse Randhawa as the ragged teacher who has got no one to help her.The find of the season undoubtedly is Mahi Gill in a special appearance. She was loved by everyone in ""Dev-D"" and here also she gives a splendid lovable act as the lover of Kay Kay. She dances and acts equally well with conviction and depth. An actress who deserves more good projects and directors like Anurag Kashayp. A good find indeed by Anurag.Coming back to the movie, it has some worth mentioning sequences which include the one when Dilip is stripped and thrown in a room where he finds his own lady lecturer also stripped and locked. The conversation scene between Ransa and Aditya, just before he is killed and hanged in the market place. And the sequence where a policeman is shot sending all his accompanying policemen back in their jeep.The dialogues are strong and hard but also use abusive words in an overdone manner. Many times, abuses are used where they were not needed at all. Cinematography is brilliant capturing the intense moments in the right ambiance. But the script has many loopholes which could have been avoided easily keeping stress on the main plot only. There are too many stories moving in at the same time which take away the real meaning of the title ""Gulaal"". The main plot of the rebellion force of Rajputana gets lost in other stories and gets attention only toward the climax.The writer tries to point out the stress felt by all the Rajput Kings, who had to surrender their areas to the government after independence. But at the same time he also dangerously suggests another kind of fire which still may be hidden in those areas of the country. Luckily it's only a fictional thought of the writer, quite away from the reality.Piyush Mishra comes up with some good meaningful lyrics and composition just apt for the feel of the movie. The songs are not for everyone but they do deserve a serious listening by all music lovers and chances are that many would like the score a lot.The movie was in the making for more than 4-5 years and several reasons were responsible for its delay. The project was recently revived, when it was taken over by ZEE Group under its ZEE Limelight Movies. The movie may find itself recognized in the New Wave Cinema but it would be difficult for the film to make huge profits for the production house.In simple words, GULAAL is not for all and is strictly for the people who know that they want to see this out of the box kind of cinema. Viewers going to the cinema having that in mind will not be disappointed, but it's not as engrossing as it promised to be.",critiques delight may be but its confusion common viewer,delivering what was expected here is another quality abstract art movie anurag kashyap as case always is movie may win over critiques but it fails make direct contact with common man coming theaters entertainment anurag is brilliant his own form film making will definitely satisfy his fan following which has reached higher graph after dev d but entertainment quotient movie scores quite low movie puts intense dark disturbing even shocking portrayal college politics rajasthan locales but lacks depth we had seen haasil sequences are all well conceived intelligently directed superbly shot capable satisfying thinking viewers big way other hand people coming looking comic factor equivalent dev d may find it disappointing that track this time anurag strictly sticks intense narration complete movie with no relief moment at all story revolves around young college students who become victim cruel local politics it also has angle conspiracy being planned against government by rajput families first half shows rusty college campus rajasthan still obsessed with brutal ragging new students even lady teachers it reveals youth election back up sources which include still called maharajas local politicians hidden rajputana rebellion force later emphasis shifts how brother uses his sister getting his due name respect leadership anurag clearly shows how female character can win anyone anything world if she is willing forget her dignity limits he represents power woman mans world his own unique captivating way acting department best comes abhimanyu singh as ransa ayesha mohan as kiran ahimanyu though dies first hour only but has power light up screen with his presence kiran gives impressive performance as girl using her feminist qualities best possible manner pankaj jha as jadhwal deepak dobriyal as bhaatti raj singh as dilip are effective kay kay aditya srivastav are first rate as always two characters who stay your mind are piyush mishra as mentally retarded elder brother kay kay jesse randhawa as ragged teacher who has got no one help her find season undoubtedly is mahi gill special appearance she was loved by everyone dev d here also she gives splendid lovable act as lover kay kay she dances acts equally well with conviction depth actress who deserves more good projects directors like anurag kashayp good find indeed by anurag coming back movie it has some worth mentioning sequences which include one when dilip is stripped thrown room where he finds his own lady lecturer also stripped locked conversation scene between ransa aditya just before he is killed hanged market place sequence where policeman is shot sending all his accompanying policemen back their jeep dialogues are strong hard but also use abusive words overdone manner many times abuses are used where they were not needed at all cinematography is brilliant capturing intense moments right ambiance but script has many loopholes which could have been avoided easily keeping stress main plot only there are too many stories moving at same time which take away real meaning title gulaal main plot rebellion force rajputana gets lost other stories gets attention only toward climax writer tries point out stress felt by all rajput kings who had surrender their areas government after independence but at same time he also dangerously suggests another kind fire which still may be hidden those areas country luckily its only fictional thought writer quite away reality piyush mishra comes up with some good meaningful lyrics composition just apt feel movie songs are not everyone but they do deserve serious listening by all music lovers chances are that many would like score lot movie was making more than 4 5 years several reasons were responsible its delay project was recently revived when it was taken over by zee group under its zee limelight movies movie may find itself recognized new wave cinema but it would be difficult film make huge profits production house simple words gulaal is not all is strictly people who know that they want see this out box kind cinema viewers going cinema having that mind will not be disappointed but its not as engrossing as it promised be,0.5563667563667563,0.16493018993018999,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.38}"
4.0,Wayward Plot,"Gulaal is wayward and unstructured. It holds you for the first 30 minutes and then on becomes a collage of multiple sub-plots. It is not clear what the focus is. At best it looks like an ensemble of adult jokes (some of them old and already heard) and liberal use of obscenities.There are multiple themes running in Gulaal. There is college politics, vanity of men stripped of royalty, insurgent freedom planning, sexual manipulations, ragging, adultery - basically one too many. What fails is a story that would thread them together sensibly.Anurag Kashyap, the director, has some good actors at his disposal but they can help only so much. Kay Kay Menon is convincing but is visibly uncomfortable in hurling abuses every ten minutes. Abhimanyu Singh (as Ransa) is the most impressive of the cast. Till the time he is on the screen, there is energy and demands attention. Mahie Gill has been unwise in choosing this film. She performs well but risks being slotted as 'the choice' for raunchy characters.The music is average, except for the opening mujra. The lyrics attempt to pass too many messages.

,Battle and Bloodshed In Modern Rajasthan,"Anurag Kashyap's 'Gulaal' feels like a modern day Shakespearean story. There are shades of 'MacBeth', 'King Lear', and even 'Othello'. Set in modern day Rajasthan, it portrays the crime world and the battle of the Rajputs for power. Kashyap is a very competent director. While his 'No Smoking' may have been sheer disappointment and his 'Dev D' a mixed baggage, his 'Black Friday' is proof enough of his capabilities. With 'Gulaal' he exceeds all expectations. He doesn't shy away from showing that he's influenced by many classics such as 'Pulp Fiction', 'L.A. Confidential' and 'Maqbool' to name a few. The director tells this original story of mindgames and fight for power with conviction. As the story unfolds, uncovering dark and disturbing themes, the characters' expose more of their psyche and the tension keeps building on. The depiction of contemporary Rajasthan and the college culture appears very real. The art direction is quite wonderful and the background score is solid. The soundtrack is also excellent especially the satirical lyrics of the songs.Kay Kay Menon is fantastic as he delivers one of his finest performances. Aditya Srivastava, Piyush Mishra, Deepak Dobriyal, Ayesha Mishra and Jessy Randhawa are superb in their roles. However, Raj Singh Chowdhury, who plays a key character doesn't exactly convince and his dialogue delivery is quite poor. Mahie Gill is impressive in a smaller role.Needless to say, Anurag Kashyap has reached his peak and I hope he continues making more movies of this quality.",battle bloodshed modern rajasthan,anurag kashyaps gulaal feels like modern day shakespearean story there are shades macbeth king lear even othello set modern day rajasthan it portrays crime world battle rajputs power kashyap is very competent director while his no smoking may have been sheer disappointment his dev d mixed baggage his black friday is proof enough his capabilities with gulaal he exceeds all expectations he doesnt shy away showing that hes influenced by many classics such as pulp fiction l confidential maqbool name few director tells this original story mindgames fight power with conviction as story unfolds uncovering dark disturbing themes characters expose more their psyche tension keeps building depiction contemporary rajasthan college culture appears very real art direction is quite wonderful background score is solid soundtrack is also excellent especially satirical lyrics songs kay kay menon is fantastic as he delivers one his finest performances aditya srivastava piyush mishra deepak dobriyal ayesha mishra jessy randhawa are superb their roles however raj singh chowdhury who plays key character doesnt exactly convince his dialogue delivery is quite poor mahie gill is impressive smaller role needless say anurag kashyap has reached his peak i hope he continues making more movies this quality,0.5798958333333333,0.16203125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"

Abimanyu Singh puts an unforgettable performance in this movie that truly defines a Rajput better than history books. KK Menon's acting as a leader is fine as usual. Ayesha's character was just okay but reminds me of SMG from cruel intentions. The songs and BGM were par excellence with no words to describe. Am unable to comment clearly on dialogues and the lyrics even though I understand the language, as I'm not a typical north Indian. Yet they carry good meanings. Another positive is the Eunuch's character and his father (see 'em... you'll enjoy). There is a major flaw in the storyline, i.e.., don't understand how a girl can manipulate so many men and another character who is too foolish to see danger coming.

5.0,"Anurag Kashyap Cinema not at It's Best,,,,","I see Anurag Kashyap Cinema very, very keenly. The person who made milestones like 'Black Friday' & 'Dev D' has proved that he is a very different, but neat storyteller.His latest outing 'Gulaal', which again he has written & directed doesn't live up his previous works. Here's why? A film like 'Gulaal'caters to a niche audience, who appreciate cinema that vows to be completely different. Plus, the film has too much of violence and bad words. Such things not only minus the audience, but decides to disown the film. And the Rajasthani accent, oh man, sometimes really hard to get a hang of it. Coming on to pluses: Kashyap's direction is very intriguing, but his writing is flawed. The film is slow-pace and the culmination isn't convincing. You could guess something like this from the very beginning! Piyush Mishra's music suits the film. Performances are note-worthy: Kay Kay excels, yet again. I died laughing when he made his version of 'Jack & Jill, Went Up The Hill', hilarious! Raj Singh Chaudhry has talent, but his voice is a bit irritating. Abhimanyu Singh is excellent in a brief role.

10.0,"Gulaal-Method Acting, Character Lighting and ..","A dream to turn Rajasthan into a titular sovereign, Rajputana for the Rajputs, the labyrinthine interplay of politics and the intricacy of emotions and pretension that all come so naturally in the apparent calm but yet turbulent scenario and the quintessential representative of the bourgeois who gets sucked into the whirlpool of these muddy affairs form the thematic thread of Anurag Kashyap's Gulaal, arguably his best film.A John Lenon worshiper who sings for and about the greatest Hell(o) (T)here(Piyush Mishra), an exploited Lady Macbeth(Ayesha Mohan) and her brother tugging at the puppet's strings(Aditya Srivastava), Shelley's (To The) Moon who teaches Nihilism(Jesse Randhawa), a King Edward who is not interested in becoming one yet living like one(Abhimanyu Singh) form the psychedelic collage around the two pivots in the scenario-the spineless bourgeois(Raja Chaudhury) and the big fish(Kay Kay Menon).It does not have a helluva plot. Had the treatment gone wrong, it would appear as clichéd as it can be. But the craft is amazing. Every frame is just perfect. I maybe woefully ignorant, but I have never seen such amazing character lighting in any mainstream Indian film. Sample this, the King lounging, and the frame is lighted with a warm halogen glow, as soon as he hears of his son's death, the lighting changes to an intense red. So much said, yet so simply. The art direction is par excellence. Don't miss the Neon lights outside Raja Chaudhury's room as he is about to enter with Ayesha Menon to make out, the lights resemble the yin-yan symbol. Or the neons infront of Che Guevara's picture that resemble a motorcycle. The alcohol brands are named Democracy, Republican, Capitalism, et alWasiq Khan.take a bow.Coming to music, the lovely rustic charm of the tunes is not the only thing that lingers with you, but the masterful words that accompany the compositions. Sung and composed by Piyush Mishra, I could not believeit's the same person who wrote Ghajini. And what an actor! He has the best lines and the most significant scenes. One of the most dramatic scenes, where he had smeared the red gulaal on his face and asks if people could recognize him or not. When he gets the obvious answer, he demands to know what was the logic of smearing gulaal to hide one's identity in the revolutionary meetings. Instead he suggested to wear a monkey-mask. The context and relevance is just wonderfully conveyed. Or the scene where Kay Kay dies in his arms. The misunderstood genius, the confused psyche, the conventional crackpot..all summed and molded into one character..it will be criminal to regard only the aspects the this character has to offer to the narrative.but I can only stammer my praise. Prithvi Bana's character is soI don't know what word to use..I can write a whole post in deconstructing that particular characterization.Kay Kay is outstanding as usual. Jesse Randhawa and Ayesha Mohan are phenomenal. Raja Chaudhary, Abhimanyu Singh, Aditya Srivastava play their parts well. But one must mention Mahie Gill. I have not seen Dev.D as yet, but I must say, in her almost blink-and-miss yet important role as a foil to other characters and as a catalyst to the drama, she is simply outstanding.This film is just too good. The amount of stuff that has been crammed in is damn commendable.

8.0,"Power packed, enthralling and a must watch.","Power packed, enthralling and a must watch.This is a movie that is inspired from a song ""yeh duniya"" from Pyaasa (1957) and comes out completely powerful and gripping. The director Anurag Kashyap is playful with his symbolism and his characters. Symbolism is really a tough thing to decipher and that's what makes this one each time enjoyable when I watched it.Let me go through symbolism, Piyush Mishra refers to John Lennon as ""His Highness Imagine Singh"". ""Nihilism"" is written on black board of a law classroom, now how do we interpret each thing and why were such things placed. Even Ardhnaari is a character that is just inexplicable and yet symbolic perhaps to underachievers.Coming to characters, each one has a flavor from and impertinent Bhati to all important Duki Bana and even the ladies have their say. Kiran among all ladies is so very underplayed and yet comes out as the most powerful woman. From a flamboyant Rananjay to a dogmatic and naive Dileep Singh, each one has been outstandingly written and equally well portrayed.A story of fighting for separate state has never been darker and interesting than this one. All kudos to Anurag to have perceived this story and told it so well. Now to add to the color of the movie, comes in Piyush Mishra who not only acts but also provides music and writes the songs for this and makes this tale poetically beautiful. How can the already superb song ""yeh duniya"" be re interpreted, how can a powerful song as ""sheher"" be placed at funeral.Listen to the music and it's not just poetically beautiful, there it's satirical and even philosophical. Indian Ocea too gives a song with ""Yaara Maula"" that says how students are being handed weapons instead of books. Just can't get over the music of this film.Watch out for more, for one of the most powerful movies and thanks to Kay Kay, who does an outstanding job as Duki Bana. I love Rananjay more though as a character..Watch it watch it watch it. Its 4/5 and one of the best movies of the decade.",power packed enthralling must watch,power packed enthralling must watch this is movie that is inspired song yeh duniya pyaasa 1957 comes out completely powerful gripping director anurag kashyap is playful with his symbolism his characters symbolism is really tough thing decipher thats what makes this one each time enjoyable when i watched it let me go through symbolism piyush mishra refers john lennon as his highness imagine singh nihilism is written black board law classroom now how do we interpret each thing why were such things placed even ardhnaari is character that is just inexplicable yet symbolic perhaps underachievers coming characters each one has flavor impertinent bhati all important duki bana even ladies have their say kiran among all ladies is so very underplayed yet comes out as most powerful woman flamboyant rananjay dogmatic naive dileep singh each one has been outstandingly written equally well portrayed story fighting separate state has never been darker interesting than this one all kudos anurag have perceived this story told it so well now add color movie comes piyush mishra who not only acts but also provides music writes songs this makes this tale poetically beautiful how can already superb song yeh duniya be re interpreted how can powerful song as sheher be placed at funeral listen music its not just poetically beautiful there its satirical even philosophical indian ocea too gives song with yaara maula that says how students are being handed weapons instead books just cant get over music this film watch out more one most powerful movies thanks kay kay who does outstanding job as duki bana i love rananjay more though as character watch it watch it watch it its 4 5 one best movies decade,0.6954022988505748,0.3187739463601532,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.19}"
