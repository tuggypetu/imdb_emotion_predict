5,"What almost killed the Batman franchise? ""The Ice Age!""","I saw this movie upon it's release in 1997 I was just six years old and honestly I loved it so much I even had a Batman & Robin movie poster in my room that I got for attending the movies opening day. I got the movie on VHS for my birthday after it was released and I watched it pretty much every weekend at least twice but now that the movie is over twenty years old and I'm an adult with much better taste in movies I thought I'd watch the movie again on Blu Ray and give a review on my nostalgic experience and see if my opinion on the movie has changed much over the years.The first thing I will say about Batman & Robin is that it's the worst Batman movie of them all hands down no amount of nostalgia or good memories of the movie will change that it is simply awful but having said that it's still a fun movie to watch simply because of how over the top and cheesy the movie is from the over the top acting down to the absolutely terrible Batman jokes like the Bat Credit card and the hilarious Mr Freeze one liners told by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself it is impossible not to laugh when watching this movie it's not the serious Batman movie we wanted and it doesn't do the Batman character justice at all.This movie alone was the reason we didn't get a Batman movie for eight years because Batman & Robin failed completely and almost killed the franchise luckily in 2005 we got Batman Begins which introduced the true Dark Knight and would lead to the greatest Batman movie ever made in 2008 Batman The Dark Knight.I love the cast involved Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze is hilarious and Uma Thurman as the sexy, seductive Poison Ivy she really makes a deadly character like Poison Ivy a lot of fun and she really does make the character look sexy as hell.This movie is absolutely hilarious and is a guilty pleasure for me I don't watch it because it's a good movie I watch it simply because it's entertaining and enjoyable it's essentially Batman the parody it's not to be taken seriously it's a bunch of famous actors dressing in spandex so tight we actually get crotch and butt close ups so if you've always wanted to see a Bat suit with actual nipples and a cod peice then your in luck. This isn't the best Batman movie but try and enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of entertaining fun.",what almost killed batman franchise ice age,i saw this movie upon its release 1997 i was just six years old honestly i loved it so much i even had batman robin movie poster my room that i got attending movies opening day i got movie vhs my birthday after it was released i watched it pretty much every weekend at least twice but now that movie is over twenty years old im adult with much better taste movies i thought id watch movie again blu ray give review my nostalgic experience see if my opinion movie has changed much over years first thing i will say about batman robin is that its worst batman movie them all hands down no amount nostalgia or good memories movie will change that it is simply awful but having said that its still fun movie watch simply because how over top cheesy movie is over top acting down absolutely terrible batman jokes like bat credit card hilarious mr freeze one liners told by arnold schwarzenegger himself it is impossible not laugh when watching this movie its not serious batman movie we wanted it doesnt do batman character justice at all this movie alone was reason we didnt get batman movie eight years because batman robin failed completely almost killed franchise luckily 2005 we got batman begins which introduced true dark knight would lead greatest batman movie ever made 2008 batman dark knight i love cast involved arnold schwarzenegger as mr freeze is hilarious uma thurman as sexy seductive poison ivy she really makes deadly character like poison ivy lot fun she really does make character look sexy as hell this movie is absolutely hilarious is guilty pleasure me i dont watch it because its good movie i watch it simply because its entertaining enjoyable its essentially batman parody its not be taken seriously its bunch famous actors dressing spandex so tight we actually get crotch butt close ups so if youve always wanted see bat suit with actual nipples cod peice then your luck this isnt best batman movie but try enjoy it what it is hour half entertaining fun,0.5160394265232975,0.10715565796210959,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.18}"

2,I really can't believe Joel did this,"Batman & Robin, the big summer movie of 1997, I remember seeing this in the theater when I was 12 and even then I wasn't impressed. But when I was more grown up, I watched this film again, I figured since I loved the 3 previous Batman films, why not give this one another shot? Now, seeing this movie once again, I can understand the low rating on IMDb, this movie was just a pathetic attempt at merchandising Batman and making an over the top action movie that really had nothing to do with Batman. The casting was just oh, so plain wrong. We have Arnold Schwartzenegger as Dr. Freeze?! Not to mention the accent, the character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, she was alright, but again, questionable casting since she seemed out of place. Now, George Clooney?! I couldn't believe how Val Kilmer got complained about, but George Clooney I can see why. He was just the most awkward Batman ever and didn't fit the role at all, he was only used for his popularity.Batman is living it up with his bachelor lifestyle, but Robin is a bit upset that he is living under Batman's shadow and wishes to be the star. Alfred is becoming very sick and needs serious help; his niece, Barbara comes to his aid and hopes to help him and stays with Bruce Wayne. Dr. Freeze is our new villain and is looking for a cure for his wife who is frozen until he can find a cure for her, he also is intending for the world to pay for what has happened to him and his wife for some reason. Dr. Pamela Isley is a plant scientist/right activist and while her boss sees her finding out more than she needs to know about an experiment on his version of Frankenstien, named Bang, he ""kills"" her with her plants. But the plants chemicals have an effect on her and actually make her into Poisen Ivy. She and Freeze team up to take over Gothem and of course to split Batman and Robin forever, oh yeah, then kill them I guess.Batman & Robin was really beyond over the top, the costumes were a bit silly and the story was just too family friendly. This is Batman, the Dark Knight, it's not meant to be this bright and so crazy. I couldn't believe Joel did this, I really wish I could get past this, I know he's going to get a bad rap for this film for the rest of his career. The acting was just stupid and not true to Batman at all. The problem here was that the story and setting just had nothing to do with what Batman truly is and was just an excuse to spend stupid money. Please, don't watch this film if you love Batman, or you'll be sorry.2/10",i really cant believe joel did this,batman robin big summer movie 1997 i remember seeing this theater when i was 12 even then i wasnt impressed but when i was more grown up i watched this film again i figured since i loved 3 previous batman films why not give this one another shot now seeing this movie once again i can understand low rating imdb this movie was just pathetic attempt at merchandising batman making over top action movie that really had nothing do with batman casting was just oh so plain wrong we have arnold schwartzenegger as dr freeze not mention accent character was just someone you felt like you could laugh off alicia silverstone as batgirl she was alright but again questionable casting since she seemed out place now george clooney i couldnt believe how val kilmer got complained about but george clooney i can see why he was just most awkward batman ever didnt fit role at all he was only used his popularity batman is living it up with his bachelor lifestyle but robin is bit upset that he is living under batmans shadow wishes be star alfred is becoming very sick needs serious help his niece barbara comes his aid hopes help him stays with bruce wayne dr freeze is our new villain is looking cure his wife who is frozen until he can find cure her he also is intending world pay what has happened him his wife some reason dr pamela isley is plant scientist right activist while her boss sees her finding out more than she needs know about experiment his version frankenstien named bang he kills her with her plants but plants chemicals have effect her actually make her into poisen ivy she freeze team up take over gothem course split batman robin forever oh yeah then kill them i guess batman robin was really beyond over top costumes were bit silly story was just too family friendly this is batman dark knight its not meant be this bright so crazy i couldnt believe joel did this i really wish i could get past this i know hes going get bad rap this film rest his career acting was just stupid not true batman at all problem here was that story setting just had nothing do with what batman truly is was just excuse spend stupid money please dont watch this film if you love batman or youll be sorry 2 10,0.5459636953955136,-0.018654073199527735,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.25}"
3,A pain in the ice.,"Strangely enough, that's one ice-related pun that Mr.Freeze doesn't use in this film. Though it does adequately describe the movie. What was I thinking, watching Batman & Robin for a third time? Even worse, what was I doing actually starting to enjoy it?Yes, there's something endearingly awful about a film that fails on almost every technical level. But it wasn't always so. The first two films in the franchise, anchored by the strong, and much undervalued lead of Michael Keaton, were enjoyable pop-art excursions by Tim Burton. The first, still by far the best, allowed Jack Nicholson to ham it up amongst retro stylings and the music of Prince. The second, Batman Returns, was a less successful effort to homage German expressionist cinema, the darkest of the four films, and struggled slightly under the weight of three villains.The lesson wasn't learnt, and the usage of multiple baddies has been a fixed staple ever since. With the third, Batman Forever, the flat acting of new bat Val Kilmer was coupled with Joel Schumacher's garish direction and Chris O'Donnell's irritating Robin. Akiva Goldsman was now the writer, and any sense of depth had given way to trite puns and disjointed set pieces.And so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with the series was expanded upon and magnified for the fourth, and by far the weakest, instalment. George Clooney has accepted a lot of the blame for this film, a humble admission but unfair. While he's clearly miscast as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he doesn't give a bad performance per se. Rather, it's his back up that lets the side down. Uma Thurman (am I the only one who doesn't think she's that good-looking?) has a great time overdoing it as Poison Ivy, but she's joined by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. Schwarz, not exactly known for his acting skill, is unrecognisable under his costume, so what's the point? He gets to call Batman ""Batunbuuurg"", refers to Robin as ""Buuurd Bouy"" and only has 100 lines in total. The fact that 26% of these lines are lame puns on the word ""ice"" that even a two-year-old would struggle to find funny is even more deplorable. And when you hear Freeze tell Batman ""Yew arr not zending mee too da cooola"" the urge to use the video's ""stop"" button is almost insurmountable.Bane makes up the trio, a monosyllabic muscleman in a gimp mask. A completely unnecessary addition, he offers nothing to the plot and goes largely forgotten. The introduction of wonky-mouthed Alicia Silverstone as a fatuous Batgirl character is also grating. And why doesn't her costume come fitted with Batnipples like the rest?Tiny traces of amusement can be gleaned from Ivy's dialogue, with her urges that her ""garden needs tending"" adding some form of adult tone to the humour. However, it's unrelenting innuendo - ""I'll help you grab your rocks"" - does start to wear thin very quickly. I did smile at Batman's cashcard: ""I never leave the cave without it""; and it's also nice to see some small references from other films. Even if it is just a glimpse of the Riddler's costume from Forever, some guards paraphrasing Cobra or some street bystanders dressed as Clockwork Orange Droogs. In fact, the idea of a Batman film as completely OTT comedy send-up may have worked, were the rest of the humour more sophisticated. ""It's the hockey team from Hell""; ""So this is where you hang out""; ""I'll cancel the pizza""; oh, how lame and functional the dialogue is!The film wraps up with a rather pathetic plot contrivance, and George having to dish out bland platitudes. ""Not all heroes wear masks""; ""to give life... that's true power"". Oh, it really is abominably bad. Batman & Robin exists as a classic example of the Hollywood system folding in under its own weight. However, the universal slating this one got neglects one factor: while the least successful, it still made over $230,000,000 at the box office. I wonder how many people would be satisfied with ""failures"" like that?",pain ice,strangely enough thats one ice related pun that mr freeze doesnt use this film though it does adequately describe movie what was i thinking watching batman robin third time even worse what was i doing actually starting enjoy it yes theres something endearingly awful about film that fails almost every technical level but it wasnt always so first two films franchise anchored by strong much undervalued lead michael keaton were enjoyable pop art excursions by tim burton first still by far best allowed jack nicholson ham it up amongst retro stylings music prince second batman returns was less successful effort homage german expressionist cinema darkest four films struggled slightly under weight three villains lesson wasnt learnt usage multiple baddies has been fixed staple ever since with third batman forever flat acting new bat val kilmer was coupled with joel schumachers garish direction chris odonnells irritating robin akiva goldsman was now writer any sense depth had given way trite puns disjointed set pieces so it was that everything that was symptomatically flawed with series was expanded upon magnified fourth by far weakest instalment george clooney has accepted lot blame this film humble admission but unfair while hes clearly miscast as both batman bruce wayne he doesnt give bad performance per se rather its his back up that lets side down uma thurman am i only one who doesnt think shes that good looking has great time overdoing it as poison ivy but shes joined by arnold schwarzenegger as mr freeze schwarz not exactly known his acting skill is unrecognisable under his costume so whats point he gets call batman batunbuuurg refers robin as buuurd bouy only has 100 lines total fact that 26 these lines are lame puns word ice that even two year old would struggle find funny is even more deplorable when you hear freeze tell batman yew arr not zending mee too da cooola urge use videos stop button is almost insurmountable bane makes up trio monosyllabic muscleman gimp mask completely unnecessary addition he offers nothing plot goes largely forgotten introduction wonky mouthed alicia silverstone as fatuous batgirl character is also grating why doesnt her costume come fitted with batnipples like rest tiny traces amusement can be gleaned ivys dialogue with her urges that her garden needs tending adding some form adult tone humour however its unrelenting innuendo ill help you grab your rocks does start wear thin very quickly i did smile at batmans cashcard i never leave cave without it its also nice see some small references other films even if it is just glimpse riddlers costume forever some guards paraphrasing cobra or some street bystanders dressed as clockwork orange droogs fact idea batman film as completely ott comedy send up may have worked were rest humour more sophisticated its hockey team hell so this is where you hang out ill cancel pizza oh how lame functional dialogue is film wraps up with rather pathetic plot contrivance george having dish out bland platitudes not all heroes wear masks give life thats true power oh it really is abominably bad batman robin exists as classic example hollywood system folding under its own weight however universal slating this one got neglects one factor while least successful it still made over 230 000 000 at box office i wonder how many people would be satisfied with failures like that,0.4884797451870622,0.018740981240981235,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.29}"
1,I've Lost Faith In Humanity,"BATMAN & ROBIN will make you lose all faith in Hollywood, indeed humanity as a whole. Stunningly awful, this was a disaster from the moment George Clooney traded in his scrubs for the black rubber boots. And it's not even awful in a cute, SHOWGIRLS kind of way. You won't laugh, but you might cry over the fact you've just flushed 125 precious minutes of your life down the crapper.While everyone involved brings shame to their families, from the uncomfortable Clooney as the lamely-interpreted hero to Governornator Arnold Schwarzenegger as the junior-high-dialog-spewing Mr. Freeze, director Joel Schumacher must be punched the hardest. Even those who thought he embarrassed the franchise with the light-hearted BATMAN FOREVER were taken aback. Schumacher treats the audience like a group of eight-year-old boys with ADD, constantly trying to impress us with unexciting action scenes like a hockey-themed opening battle reminiscent of the under-appreciated genius of MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS.The writers only make things worse with their ""witty"" hero chatter (""This is why Superman works alone""... har har, where do they come up with them??) and drawn-out ""human"" angles, such as butler Alfred's illness and a childish romantic triangle between Batman, Robin and the sexy Poison Ivy. This isn't root-on-the-heroes entertainment. On the contrary, you'll find yourself wishing Poison Ivy would tongue kiss both masked men to put us all out of our misery.I love Batman and superhero flicks. I'm not a movie snob by any means, as I'm willing to forgive many a gaffe. But I absolutely loathe BATMAN & ROBIN. I loathe how it disgraces the characters it depicts. I loathe how the ""talent"" involved is still allowed within 100 feet of a film set or writer's room. It must be said again that BATMAN & ROBIN is the kind of experience that will make you lose all faith in Hollywood -- and humanity.",ive lost faith humanity,batman robin will make you lose all faith hollywood indeed humanity as whole stunningly awful this was disaster moment george clooney traded his scrubs black rubber boots its not even awful cute showgirls kind way you wont laugh but you might cry over fact youve just flushed 125 precious minutes your life down crapper while everyone involved brings shame their families uncomfortable clooney as lamely interpreted hero governornator arnold schwarzenegger as junior high dialog spewing mr freeze director joel schumacher must be punched hardest even those who thought he embarrassed franchise with light hearted batman forever were taken aback schumacher treats audience like group eight year old boys with add constantly trying impress us with unexciting action scenes like hockey themed opening battle reminiscent under appreciated genius mighty morphin power rangers writers only make things worse with their witty hero chatter this is why superman works alone har har where do they come up with them drawn out human angles such as butler alfreds illness childish romantic triangle between batman robin sexy poison ivy this isnt root heroes entertainment contrary youll find yourself wishing poison ivy would tongue kiss both masked men put us all out our misery i love batman superhero flicks im not movie snob by any means as im willing forgive many gaffe but i absolutely loathe batman robin i loathe how it disgraces characters it depicts i loathe how talent involved is still allowed within 100 feet film set or writers room it must be said again that batman robin is kind experience that will make you lose all faith hollywood humanity,0.637361111111111,0.08086805555555554,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
1,"Uncalled for, overrated and idiotic","I know that there has to be some justice in this life, so everyone will pay for their sins and crimes someday. I shudder when I think what will happen to Joel Schumacher for killing the ""Batman"" franchise.""Batman"", the best of the series, was a dark, psychotic and complex movie with over the top acting and settings. The Batmobile was beautiful, as were the sets. The movie was forceful and interesting. ""Batman Returns"" shared some of the traits of its predecessor while adding more lunacy to the mix. It did suffer from the lack of top of the line talent (Jack Nicholson). And then Mr. Schumacher ruined everything. ""Batman Forever"" is a shame of a movie, but NOTHING compared to what this piece of garbage is. Since its from the same series, there is no excuse for the director to run wild and away from the spirit of the originals, in which a sad soul has to fight crime in order to mantain sanity. In Schumacher movies, Batman has to have the coolest cars, to kiss the most beautiful girls and to have a lot of fun while doing this. The first 2 movies acknowledged that killing or hurting people was a conscious choice which was painfully taken by Batman; in the last 2 it is as if violence was fun and part of Batman´s life.There are so many wrong things about this film it is useless to count them. But there are two things that are an insult to every film goer: the Batmobile is reduced to a clownmobile, and Batman´s suit has NIPPLES in it. What a disgrace of a movie. This doesn't even qualify as ""so bad it is good"". This is merely ""so bad it is bad"".",uncalled overrated idiotic,i know that there has be some justice this life so everyone will pay their sins crimes someday i shudder when i think what will happen joel schumacher killing batman franchise batman best series was dark psychotic complex movie with over top acting settings batmobile was beautiful as were sets movie was forceful interesting batman returns shared some traits its predecessor while adding more lunacy mix it did suffer lack top line talent jack nicholson then mr schumacher ruined everything batman forever is shame movie but nothing compared what this piece garbage is since its same series there is no excuse director run wild away spirit originals which sad soul has fight crime order mantain sanity schumacher movies batman has have coolest cars kiss most beautiful girls have lot fun while doing this first 2 movies acknowledged that killing or hurting people was conscious choice which was painfully taken by batman last 2 it is as if violence was fun part batman s life there are so many wrong things about this film it is useless count them but there are two things that are insult every film goer batmobile is reduced clownmobile batman s suit has nipples it what disgrace movie this doesnt even qualify as so bad it is good this is merely so bad it is bad,0.513611111111111,0.05194444444444445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.4, 'Fear': 0.17}"
8,The best one for kids,"I'm a Michael Keaton fan, so in my view, no one else can be Batman but him. I've never actually met anyone who's picked George Clooney as their favorite, so if you watch this one, it'll most likely be for the supporting cast. The adorable Chris O'Donnell plays Robin, the equally adorable Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a frosty yet comical villain, and Uma Thurman plays a wicked seductress. See what I mean? You'll probably forget George Clooney is even in it.Unfortunately, this installment wasn't even as successful as its predecessor Batman Forever, which wasn't very good. The consistently good feature shared by both films is the kid-friendly attitude. These are comic book movies, and should be able to be enjoyed by kids of all ages-aren't young folks the target audiences for comic books? The later volumes are far too dark and frightening. The darkest part of the movie is an uninteresting sideplot about Batman's butler Alfred's health-but it can still turn into a funny scene if you make fun of George Clooney's smirk and head tilt instead of paying attention to what he's saying. So, if you're looking for a good one to start your youngster on, this is it.",best one kids,im michael keaton fan so my view no one else can be batman but him ive never actually met anyone whos picked george clooney as their favorite so if you watch this one itll most likely be supporting cast adorable chris odonnell plays robin equally adorable alicia silverstone plays batgirl arnold schwarzenegger plays frosty yet comical villain uma thurman plays wicked seductress see what i mean youll probably forget george clooney is even it unfortunately this installment wasnt even as successful as its predecessor batman forever which wasnt very good consistently good feature shared by both films is kid friendly attitude these are comic book movies should be able be enjoyed by kids all ages arent young folks target audiences comic books later volumes are far too dark frightening darkest part movie is uninteresting sideplot about batmans butler alfreds health but it can still turn into funny scene if you make fun george clooneys smirk head tilt instead paying attention what hes saying so if youre looking good one start your youngster this is it,0.651574074074074,0.29527777777777775,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.32}"
1,"I ask you God, what have we done to deserve this?","This is hands down the worst film ever made in the history of the existence of the universe. There have been some bad films made but this is a travesty. It is hard to believe that money was spent to make this. It could have been used on something else (charity I suppose). I was 12 when I went to see this and it broke my heart. Batman was my favorite comic book and character when I was a kid and this film broke my spirit. The excellence of the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton films are long gone. The dark emotional center and development of the hero and the villains is sidelined for action sequences, action sequences and some more action sequences, some of them incorporating the worst CGI and model work ever seen on film. The casting itself had to the potential to make a good film. George Clooney could have made a great Batman (square jawed, popular with the ladies), the only thing going against him being that can be too laid back (maybe with a better script he could do the darker material). Uma Thurman is perfect for Poison Ivy. She is a good looking yet quirky actress, but you wouldn't know it by the emphasis on camp context and innuendo in this film. Arnie is maybe a little miscast as Mr Freeze, but he does well getting a chance to use some 'great' puns, but someone who can come across as more evil would have been better. Then there is Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl. Let's just say more charisma can come from a line of fridge freezers with nothing in them.

1,Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever,"Don't get me wrong, the old Adam West Batman TV show was certainly funny, and given the times, a more accurate representation of what Batman was trying to be wouldn't have succeeded nearly as well. But the show still betrayed all the emotion and grimness of Batman's themes.In Batman & Robin, Schumacher seems to be getting back to those roots. He treats the entire Batman franchise like a joke. Even if it was funny, this would be betraying the name of Batman. But here, seeing as it's NOT funny, it only succeeds in becoming the worst of the Batman movies, and, arguably, the worst films ever created. And I'm taking into account Plan 9 From Outer Space, Gigli, and You Got Served.George Clooney just plays George Clooney. Which is the road he usually takes, but this suave, dashing, and charming Batman seems more like Mystery Men's Captain Amazing than the crimefighter of legend.There's Chris O'Donnell, the angst-ridden Robin trying to break out of Batman's shadow. The only thing he ever really does is act like a child.Alicia Silverstone. Wow. I seriously wonder what makes someone say, ""Hmm, who should we get to play Batgirl . . . I know! Alicia Silverstone!"" No offense to Alicia, but she's out in right field on this one. Her tough-girl performance is sprinkled with reminders of her Clueless days. But all that aside, she actually does very little.Now, onto the villains. Uma Thurman, who we know CAN act, is hamming it up to ridiculous proportions. First, when she's playing the nerdy Dr. Pamela, she exaggerates that to a level I thought impossible. And then she inexplicably turns into an extremely sexualized villainess whose plan, by the way, would kill all the plants she advocated protecting.Arnold seems like the worst possible choice for Mr. Freeze. I mean, of all the Batman villains I could see him playing - Bane, for christ's sake - Mr. Freeze is not on that list. He possesses none of the emotionless, calculated, and cold (no pun intended) sociopathy which makes Mr. Freeze such a good character.And then, all that aside, they're handed ridiculous catch phrases and cliches they're expected to say with any level of sincerity? At one point Mr. Freeze says ""chill out."" Of all the ways it sounds, menacing is not among them.Seriously, I'd have more respect for Schumacher if I discovered that he hated Batman, and had intentionally ruined it with this garbage. Then, this might actually be just his own personal joke. Instead, it borders on a travesty of good cinema.

3,Definitely the worst of the Batman movies.,"The film does have nice costumes, and nice sets. Unfortunately that is about it. One major problem is some of the choices of actors.They were all wasted. George Clooney is quite a charming actor, but he is not my idea of Batman. Batman I don't think is supposed to be charming, he's supposed to be dark and brooding, and Clooney lacked that. What would Michael Keaten and Val Kilmer and even Christian Bale say when they see that Batman has turned charming? Chris O' Donnell looked uncomfortable, and in almost every movie where he is a hero, this includes the 1993 version of the Three Musketeers, he is rather lifeless. Uma Thurman does her best, but what they gave her to work with was ridiculous, and she just failed to deliver, while Alicia Silverstone was extremely annoying. The worst case was poor Arnold Schwarznegger. He was completely miscast as Mr Freeze, completely lacking the coldness and evilness that makes the character so memorable. Schwarznegger is a talented actor, but his skills are hidden beyond recognition in this movie, he just looked so uncomfortable and totally out of character. The direction from Joel Schummacher was disappointing as well, it lacked the artistic flair and the temperament that is needed to make a great film. This is further disadvantaged by a truly pathetic script that nobody in the cast could do anything with.(these actors deserved so much better)The special effects were okay, but very confused in terms of execution. In conclusion, not the worst movie, I have ever seen, but it is one of those films, where everything needed to make it memorable falls flat. 3/10 for effort.

1,How to make the worst movie EVER! In 10 easy steps.,"1. Cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as a scientist and have him spout nothing but one-liners for the entire movie. I cannot stress how bad his performance is. Even by his standards the level of acting is shockingly poor. Also Mr. Freeze was an intelligent guy in the comics then it doesn't do to cast a guy who can't even speak American without a heavy accent. Despite Schwarzenegger's intellect (he is one of the governors in USA with the highest IQ) he comes off as an ignorant person because of his accent.2. Allow George Clooney to play Batman as gay. I am actually a fan of Clooney but his performance in this movie is disgraceful to say the least. He has stated himself that he found it amusing to play Bruce Wayne as gay. I, a great fan of the comics, did not find this amusing at all.3. Move away from the serious tone of the first movies (which made them successful) and do a poor imitation of the 60's camp show with Adam West.4. Cast Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. I usually think Uma Thurman is hot but her overacting in this movie is so distasteful she loses all kind of sexual appeal, which in turn destroys any kind of menace the character should have had. Poor, poor, poor.5. Allowing Joel Schumacher free reins over the movie after seeing which direction he was taking the franchise with the previous movie. This is just the sign of a bad producer.6. Remove all tension in the fight sequences by dumbing them down to the point where it is beyond stupidity. Batman and Robin playing hockey with a diamond is not my idea of a cool fight scene. Several fight scenes actually had me gasping with shock as to how poor they are.7. Cast Alicia Silverstone as a bad girl (Batgirl). She cannot pull it off.8. The nipples people. THE NIPPLES!!! How ridiculous is this?! Batman and Robin's suits have nipples but when Batgirl makes her entrance notice the lack of the same.9. Write a script that makes no sense whatsoever.10. Turn one of the most memorable villains of the comics into a brainless henchman. I am referring of course to Bane who in the comics is one of Batman's worst enemies because of his strength and intellect. Bane has actually beaten Batman on several occasions and although The Joker is undoubtedly Batman's nemesis Bane isn't far off. I squirm with the way they treated him in this movie.In my honest opinion this could in fact be the worst movie... no scratch that... worst thing man has ever created. So with that I give my final score.1/10",how make worst movie ever 10 easy steps,1 cast arnold schwarzenegger as scientist have him spout nothing but one liners entire movie i cannot stress how bad his performance is even by his standards level acting is shockingly poor also mr freeze was intelligent guy comics then it doesnt do cast guy who cant even speak american without heavy accent despite schwarzeneggers intellect he is one governors usa with highest iq he comes off as ignorant person because his accent 2 allow george clooney play batman as gay i am actually fan clooney but his performance this movie is disgraceful say least he has stated himself that he found it amusing play bruce wayne as gay i great fan comics did not find this amusing at all 3 move away serious tone first movies which made them successful do poor imitation 60s camp show with adam west 4 cast uma thurman as poison ivy i usually think uma thurman is hot but her overacting this movie is so distasteful she loses all kind sexual appeal which turn destroys any kind menace character should have had poor poor poor 5 allowing joel schumacher free reins over movie after seeing which direction he was taking franchise with previous movie this is just sign bad producer 6 remove all tension fight sequences by dumbing them down point where it is beyond stupidity batman robin playing hockey with diamond is not my idea cool fight scene several fight scenes actually had me gasping with shock as how poor they are 7 cast alicia silverstone as bad girl batgirl she cannot pull it off 8 nipples people nipples how ridiculous is this batman robins suits have nipples but when batgirl makes her entrance notice lack same 9 write script that makes no sense whatsoever 10 turn one most memorable villains comics into brainless henchman i am referring course bane who comics is one batmans worst enemies because his strength intellect bane has actually beaten batman several occasions although joker is undoubtedly batmans nemesis bane isnt far off i squirm with way they treated him this movie my honest opinion this could fact be worst movie no scratch that worst thing man has ever created so with that i give my final score 1 10,0.6035639412997904,-0.04350104821802933,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.31}"
5,A Well-Done Bad Movie.,"Generally considered one of the worst things ever brought to the screen, Batman & Robin is very fun. When people say this movie is terrible, I agree but they never acknowledge the redeeming qualities, which are what make this movie bad. Doesn't make much sense? Arnold delivers cheesy puns and one-liners galore, they do suck but are hilarious at the same time. George Clooney does such a bad job, you can't help laughing. Everybody is so over-the-top and cheesy, you have to laugh. That may be why Chris O'Donnell's and Silverstone's careers were pretty much ruined after this: gets recognized for Scent of a Woman; breaks out in Batman Forever; then gets screwed in this. Silverstone does some music videos, breaks out in Clueless, then gets screwed by this. All other actors pretty much had their feet firmly planted. The set design and special effects were actually well-done. But people criticized this portion for being too weird-looking and overly-extravagant. Maybe they were, but doing all that the way Schumacher did is extremely difficult. Plus it saves us from the bad story and bad acting. I did say the acting is funny, but after a while it gets to be too much. It starts off fun, but eventually gets boring since there is no good plot or characters. It just keeps going until you have enough. I know that two hours isn't very long for a movie, but in this case, it was. Just take twenty minutes away and it would have been better.2/4",well done bad movie,generally considered one worst things ever brought screen batman robin is very fun when people say this movie is terrible i agree but they never acknowledge redeeming qualities which are what make this movie bad doesnt make much sense arnold delivers cheesy puns one liners galore they do suck but are hilarious at same time george clooney does such bad job you cant help laughing everybody is so over top cheesy you have laugh that may be why chris odonnells silverstones careers were pretty much ruined after this gets recognized scent woman breaks out batman forever then gets screwed this silverstone does some music videos breaks out clueless then gets screwed by this all other actors pretty much had their feet firmly planted set design special effects were actually well done but people criticized this portion being too weird looking overly extravagant maybe they were but doing all that way schumacher did is extremely difficult plus it saves us bad story bad acting i did say acting is funny but after while it gets be too much it starts off fun but eventually gets boring since there is no good plot or characters it just keeps going until you have enough i know that two hours isnt very long movie but this case it was just take twenty minutes away it would have been better 2 4,0.5627568922305765,-0.11296992481203005,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.23}"
6,Not as good as the first three,"This film was not as good as the first three films. It could've been better, but it was not all that bad. Joel Shumacher returns as director for the fourth sequel of the Batman series. There are some surprising actors in this film. George Clooney takes on the role of Batman while Arnold Schwarznegger takes the role of Batman's nemesis, Dr. Freeze. Freeze wants to ice the city up and he gets some help along the way in the form of Poison Ivy(Uma Thurman). The acting was not terrible, but in some ways it could've been better. The score was not as strong as the first couple films. The script was alright, but the plot line was the best about the film. I also like the costumes that were used in the film. They were very unique. Die-hard fans of Batman will be disappointed at this movie. But, I liked it a little.

7,"Hey, Lighten Up Batman Fans!","Most people, especially fans of the earlier Batman films, hated this movie. I did not. In fact, although it's not my favorite in the series (my vote goes to Batman Returns), I still found this refreshing in its cartoon-ish innocence. After all, it is based on a cartoon, so what is so unforgivable about making it light-hearted just once. Does everything have to be dark and brooding? I hope not. Well, unfortunately, people like the darkness more than the light. Just look at the reviews here, for an example of that.I just went along for the ride on this, enjoying the outlandish characters and corny-but-humorous lines delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. Both were a lot of fun to watch. Batman, meanwhile, has been played by some many actors I don't care anymore who has the role.....its' nothing to get serious about, anyway.Whoever seems to play him does a decent job. This Batman version seems a lot more softer character, higher-principled and compassionate....sort of the real-life wacko (George Clooney) who views himself as such as a knight in shining armor for the typical Hollywood Left Wing crowd. But....we'll forgive him, for he not knows what he says.I appreciated the added humor in this film, the fact there almost no profanity, unlike the other versions; the wild special effects, ogling Uma Thurman, who looked fantastic; great color and surround sound; interesting sets and a nice message at the end.The negatives were: a little too much action which can make you dizzy trying to follow; a somewhat-annoying Robin (Chris O'Donnell); Alicia Silverstone's role as Batgirl adding nothing to the film; and a little too many sexual innuendos to counteract the absence of profanity, I suppose.Overall, a fun movie not to be taken seriously: simply a cartoon come to life, which is what some people think it should have been in the first place.",hey lighten up batman fans,most people especially fans earlier batman films hated this movie i did not fact although its not my favorite series my vote goes batman returns i still found this refreshing its cartoon ish innocence after all it is based cartoon so what is so unforgivable about making it light hearted just once does everything have be dark brooding i hope not well unfortunately people like darkness more than light just look at reviews here example that i just went along ride this enjoying outlandish characters corny but humorous lines delivered by arnold schwarzenegger as mr freeze uma thurman as poison ivy both were lot fun watch batman meanwhile has been played by some many actors i dont care anymore who has role its nothing get serious about anyway whoever seems play him does decent job this batman version seems lot more softer character higher principled compassionate sort real life wacko george clooney who views himself as such as knight shining armor typical hollywood left wing crowd but well forgive him he not knows what he says i appreciated added humor this film fact there almost no profanity unlike other versions wild special effects ogling uma thurman who looked fantastic great color surround sound interesting sets nice message at end negatives were little too much action which can make you dizzy trying follow somewhat annoying robin chris odonnell alicia silverstones role as batgirl adding nothing film little too many sexual innuendos counteract absence profanity i suppose overall fun movie not be taken seriously simply cartoon come life which is what some people think it should have been first place,0.538455149501661,0.17119324473975636,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.28}"

8,R.I.P Joel Schumacher,"Batman & Robin is one of my all time favourite movies! George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger deliver the performances of a lifetime! Okay, jokes aside, this movie is pretty laughable, Joel Schumacher directed a far more brighter and colourful Batman movie compared to the darker Tim Burton approach. When I was around 7, this used to be my favourite Batman movie! Not even gonna lie, then I got around to becoming a film-lover and realised how bad this movie really is! The only reason it gets an 8 is because Schwarzenegger actually makes the movie funny, George Clooney's suit is kind of nostalgic for me in all honesty and some of the camera angles are pretty dope, ngl. This is also the movie that brought us the Nolan Batman trilogy which is 2000 times better than this piece of... *masterpiece* (of) cleverness and absolute genius!

2,Much more cartoony and silly than previous Batmans....and often an insult to your intelligence.,"""Batman & Robin"" is currently #58 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List....which would indicate it's a truly horrible film. Interestingly, despite there being many horrible superhero movies (such as ""The Spirit"" and ""Catwoman""), this and ""Superman IV"" are the only ones currently on the list....so it's quite a dubious achievement!Despite ""Batman & Robin"" being a terrible film, it is interesting to note that despite the film costing an ungodly $125,000,000 to make...it DID manage to earn about double the cost...making it Warner Brothers' biggest moneymaker of the year. It's bad press did, however, help destroy the franchise until it was revived and revamped several years later with Christian Bale and Chrisopher Nolan.When the film started, I could almost see instantly why the movie was a stinker. It was completely cartoonish compared to the previous Batman films of the 80s and 90s. Seeing Batman and Robin in a hockey game with Mr. Freeze and his minions simply made me cringe...as did the sound effects throughout the film. Several times, the punching and kicking sounds were pretty much straight from the campy old TV series....and fans must have been infuriated to see the series turned into a dumbed down cartoonish nightmare. Did the stupidity in this scene get any worse in this opening scene? Yup...when Freeze escapes in a rocket (???) and Batman and Robin chase the film leaps into ultra-stupid mode! It ended hellishly, with Batman and Robin both jumping from the rocket on sky surfboards and they miraculously survived--and during their descent Robin yells out 'Cowabunga'!! What follows rarely got much better...and again and again the film resorted to cartoonism instead of making a decent film that wouldn't infuriate audiences.Another horrible scene was the homage to Marlene Dietrich in her dance scene from ""Blonde Venus"". The Dietrich dance was dumb....the version with Uma Thurman managed to make it even stupider. Seeing her in magenta gorilla costume was indeed stupid!To make everything worse, Miss Thurman overacted terribly throughout the film and I'd say she was the weakest and most annoying actor in the cast....and I assume she was only doing what the director and writer instructed her to do. The same can be said about all the horrid puns uttered by Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze....he was just doing what he was told to do. And, ultimately the crap dialog between the three crime fighters is pretty much the same...the delivered the crap that they were given.In order to have made a good film, ""Batman & Robin"" should have learned SOMETHING from ""Batman"" (1989). It should have been darker, had one GOOD villain instead of three lousy ones and not given way to cheap stunts and gimmickery. Instead of a dark, brooding story, this one looks almost like it was filmed inside a carnival fun house...complete with glow in the dark neon paint and one dimensional characters.Overall, a truly horrid pile of vomit. The film manages to earn a 2...but only because for $125,000,000 the film ultimately must look good...at least at times.So was there anything I liked about the movie? Well, I did laugh at the scene where Mr. Freeze was watching the Snow Miser from ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" TV special...and he tried to make his minions sing along with him. It was dumb...but it did make me laugh and was one of the few moments that I didn't hate myself for watching this movie.",much more cartoony silly than previous batmans often insult your intelligence,batman robin is currently imdbs infamous bottom 100 list which would indicate its truly horrible film interestingly despite there being many horrible superhero movies such as spirit catwoman this superman iv are only ones currently list so its quite dubious achievement despite batman robin being terrible film it is interesting note that despite film costing ungodly 125 000 000 make it did manage earn about double cost making it warner brothers biggest moneymaker year its bad press did however help destroy franchise until it was revived revamped several years later with christian bale chrisopher nolan when film started i could almost see instantly why movie was stinker it was completely cartoonish compared previous batman films 80s 90s seeing batman robin hockey game with mr freeze his minions simply made me cringe as did sound effects throughout film several times punching kicking sounds were pretty much straight campy old tv series fans must have been infuriated see series turned into dumbed down cartoonish nightmare did stupidity this scene get any worse this opening scene yup when freeze escapes rocket batman robin chase film leaps into ultra stupid mode it ended hellishly with batman robin both jumping rocket sky surfboards they miraculously survived during their descent robin yells out cowabunga what follows rarely got much better again again film resorted cartoonism instead making decent film that wouldnt infuriate audiences another horrible scene was homage marlene dietrich her dance scene blonde venus dietrich dance was dumb version with uma thurman managed make it even stupider seeing her magenta gorilla costume was indeed stupid make everything worse miss thurman overacted terribly throughout film id say she was weakest most annoying actor cast i assume she was only doing what director writer instructed her do same can be said about all horrid puns uttered by schwarzenegger as mr freeze he was just doing what he was told do ultimately crap dialog between three crime fighters is pretty much same delivered crap that they were given order have made good film batman robin should have learned something batman 1989 it should have been darker had one good villain instead three lousy ones not given way cheap stunts gimmickery instead dark brooding story this one looks almost like it was filmed inside carnival fun house complete with glow dark neon paint one dimensional characters overall truly horrid pile vomit film manages earn 2 but only because 125 000 000 film ultimately must look good at least at times so was there anything i liked about movie well i did laugh at scene where mr freeze was watching snow miser year without santa claus tv special he tried make his minions sing along with him it was dumb but it did make me laugh was one few moments that i didnt hate myself watching this movie,0.5385526895943563,-0.1015983245149912,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7,Good,"It is hard to describe life. Stories about mermaids fighting wars in different galaxies, that is easy to describe; but writing about life, sometimes all you can say is, ""It's about life."" Batman and Robin is a story about a place, a place most people might not be able to conceive: where things are dying, where people survive off liquor and cigarettes, where those who are supposed to love us drive knives into our backs. Clooney is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him. This film has a feel; you can sense it and I was getting a little shaky halfway through.",good,it is hard describe life stories about mermaids fighting wars different galaxies that is easy describe but writing about life sometimes all you can say is its about life batman robin is story about place place most people might not be able conceive where things are dying where people survive off liquor cigarettes where those who are supposed love us drive knives into our backs clooney is good when he is bad good when he is good so no point dwelling him its worth watching this movie just see him this film has feel you can sense it i was getting little shaky halfway through,0.5619047619047619,0.25148809523809523,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.43}"
1,Worst Film of All Time,"Why did I called this the worst film of the 90's well let me tell you Batman & Robin is stupid, boring, toy commercial done wrong, and it's really that awful.But let's go to the positives: Almost all of the vehicles in the film look really cool to look at.The special effects are good, especially since most of them are practical with a small touch of CGI.Like its predecessor, the outfits are nicely done (if it weren't for the fact that they put visible nipples on the superhero suits). Before Joel Schumacher died 23 years after this film, he thankfully apologized to a lot of angry Batman fans in the documentary film, Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight and on the film's 20th anniversary for ruining the Batman film franchise, claiming that it wasn't his intention to ruin the franchise, but that his intention was to entertain them. This film can make for a great comedy if not taken seriously, and can be ""so bad it's good"". The soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal is great, even better than his previous work on Batman Forever. Speaking of the soundtrack, the song The End is the Beginning is the End by The Smashing Pumpkins is decent and it would later appear in the teaser trailer of the film adaptation of another DC movie, Watchmen. As mentioned above, there are unintentionally funny moments.Now let's go to Why It Can Freeze Your Sanity: While Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever was less dark and more kid friendly to appease, Warner Bros.' executives felt Batman Returns was too dark and inappropriate for kids, as Schumacher was told to make this movie even more kid friendly to where dark elements of any kind from the previous movies had to be done away with entirely, thus killing the franchise entirely on ice. Despite it being called Batman & Robin, they don't team up that much here. While the premise of Batman and Robin going up against Poison Ivy, Bane, and Mr. Freeze sounded very original and a very great idea, it was sadly and unfortunately ruined by a horrible execution that essentially turned the original Batman film series into a dead horse with lots of campiness instead of dark subject matter.The costume designs, while okay, did not improve from Batman Forever, as Batman's suits are recolors from Forever, while Robin's costume is just a red version of his other alter-ego, Nightwing with a cape.They added so much unwanted details such as the infamous Bat-nipples and Bat-butts.The vehicles look like too toy-like and silly like it came straight from an elementary kid's story that he/she wants to tell.In fact, Schumacher himself later expressed his regret over the film being essentially turned into a feature-length toy commercial.Poor grasp of the source material (e.g., Barbara/Batgirl is now Alfred Pennyworth's niece instead of Commissioner Jim Gordon's daughter in the comics, and Mr Freeze got his accident from falling into snowy smokes instead of being confronted by Gothcorp CEO, Ferris Boyle).Blatant disregard for physics (i.e., characters being able to safely jump from dangerous heights).Numerous oddities, plot holes, and inconsistencies, including but not limited to: Mr. Freeze can somehow smoke a cigarette, which goes against the state of his altered biology.Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy does not seem very compatible as partners because he wants to freeze the world and she wants plants to roam the world. Plants cannot survive in freezing temperatures.Ms. B. Haven shows no ill effects from wearing a skimpy outfit in Freeze's frozen hideout.After Mr. Freeze takes out two vials with a blue liquid in them, we see that they fit perfectly into Alfred's IV stand in the Wayne Manor. Unless they were both made by Wayne Enterprises, it's not possible to fit it in the IV stand that perfectly.During the chase at the beginning of the movie, Mr. Freeze freezes Robin before he can snatch the diamond but chooses to spare Batman by saying he'll kill him later, which is idiotic since nothing is stopping him from doing to Batman what he did to Robin.There's a pointless scene where we see the Riddler and Two-Face's outfits at the Arkham Asylum from the previous film and speaking of Two-Face, isn't he supposed to be dead?!Batman and Robin appear at an auction instead of as their actual selves, which is strange since they usually only show up when a crime is going down.During a scene where Batman, Robin, and Batgirl are on their vehicles and are being pursued by Freeze's henchmen, she's wearing a mask that looks hideous on her, but as soon as they reach the museum, she takes it off (supposedly because Alicia Silverstone didn't want to wear it due to how awful it looked on her).There's one scene that features rubber ice on the car; no joke, there's actual rubber ice on the car!Countless amounts of product placement, such as the Apple Macintosh computers.There are numerous technical oddities present in the film which adds to how poorly made the movie is. For example: When Robin comes out of the water in one scene, the scene goes in reverse motion just so he goes back under.When Mr. Freeze says ""It's winter forever here in Gotham!"", the audio doesn't seem synced to the movement of his lips.Very poor acting on everyone's part, especially George Clooney as Batman. Speaking of which, he was only hired as a replacement for Val Kilmer since he was committed to another movie, hence why Clooney took his place, which comes off odd since both movies feature the same director but with two completely different actors playing Batman.Speaking of the acting, most of the Batman fans thought that George Clooney made a poor Batman, and he himself even admitted that he really didn't like playing Batman and would not portray him again in a planned cancelled sequel. Years after starring in this film, he refuses to talk to people about how awful he felt playing Batman and most people don't blame him for being unhappy about it.Chris O'Donnell's acting for Robin is very poor, even worse than Forever, as he sounds like a bratty teenager and all-around moron, and his character Dick Grayson/Robin spends most of his screen-time acting like a whiny brat just like his Teen Titans Go! Counterpart.The villains are not as good as they were in the comics books for many reasons: Mr. Freeze is portrayed as an absolute joke of a sympathetic villain who relies on ice puns for his lines, using his vehicles and a winged jetpack that came straight from the film's toy designs.Bane is portrayed as being an incredibly dim-wit named Antonio Diego in stark contrast to his comic book counterpart, who has genius-level intellect.Jason Woodrue, who is one of Swamp Thing's arch-nemeses as the Floronic Man in the comics, is now a generic ""mad scientist"" who creates Bane and Poison Ivy before getting killed by the latter.The first two Batman films had a very dark and serious tone and was done quite well, and while the third film was a bit more light-hearted, it had its dark moments as well, but however, this film is way too silly and syrupy for a superhero film, even so, more than the 1966 Batman TV series.And also, a cartoon sound effect can be heard when a fighting scene happens like a tripping sound effect.The infamous scene where Batman, despite being very rich, reveals that he has ""A BAT CREDIT CARD!"" which was just nonsensical and had no reason to exist at all because Bat Credit Cards do not exist in real life.Numerous unnecessary homoerotic innuendos, such as the camera zooming in on everyone's buttocks and crotches during the opening sequence, as well as Batgirl's suiting-up sequences showing her breasts and buttocks as well (there is an interesting theory that they are in the film due to Joel Schumacher being homosexual).The pacing is awful. While Forever's pacing was hit or miss, the action scenes were at least decently done. But here in this film, nothing feels paced properly at all.Numerous laughable dialogue and moments make it feel like an unintentional comedy. For example: I want a car... Chicks dig the car!This is why Superman works alone.When Barbara is first seen visiting with Alfred, she says I suppose they don't have fax machines on elephants.Unbelievably bad one-liners and puns from Mr. Freeze, something his mainstream and animated counterparts would never do. For example: What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!Alright everyone, chill! Chill! Chill!My name is Mr. Freeze. Learn it well from the chilling sounds of your doom.Tonight! Hell freezes over!Tonight's forecast, a freeze is coming.Even Batman himself made a horrible pun: Hey Freeze! The heat is on!Poison Ivy's origin story copies Selina Kyle/Catwoman's backstory from the second film, as both backstories involve a shy scientist discovering her boss's evil plans and he tries to kill her, but she revives and transforms into a villain.Barbara Pennyworth/Batgirl barely contributes to the plot, and thus there is no need for her to be in the movie.Pointless subplots such as Barbara's motorcycling hobby, Alfred's sickness, and Wayne's plans with his girlfriend.On the topic of his girlfriend, she is bland, underdeveloped, and unnecessary, not to mention doesn't even have a role in the movie.Wow I have never seen this pathetic. No wonder this is absolute worst film of the 90's let's see the story is awful, the characters are one dimensional, the setting is too cartoony, and cinematography is so lazy and the writing is so lazy.Overall this is the laziest film I ever saw it so bad it's hilarious 🤣 or so bad it's lazy and boring and overall you may have the skip this one because the Animat's Seal of Garbage 🗑 will shine

7,Not That Bad,"Not that great, either. Most of the bad things you've heard about this movie are true, but that doesn't stop the film from being entertaining.Seeing Batman and Arnold Schwarzenegger duke it out is reason enough to see ""Batman & Robin."" But while Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze carries impressive weapons and strikes a menacing figure, his lines are cheesy instead of threatening. In fact, cheesier lines haven't been heard since Adam West played Batman.George Clooney makes a likable super hero. Unfortunately, he's not really Batman. Batman is tormented by inner demons. George Clooney never stops smiling. Even though Adam West's lines as Batman were unbelievable, he still said them with a straight face, as if they were serious. George Clooney says even serious lines with a cheesy grin. He's believable as rich playboy Bruce Wayne, but, even though his attempt to get Batman to lighten up was a noble idea, the character should be played with some darkness.Still, there's a great warmness between Clooney and Michael Gough, who plays Alfred the butler, and between Clooney and Chris O'Donnel, who plays Robin the Boy Wonder. Bruce Wayne's personal life is in turmoil. Alfred, his friend and mentor, is dying, and Bruce must cope with the idea that he might lose him. Robin is tired of standing in Batman's shadow and begins to jeopardize the Dynamic Duo's partnership. Both subplots are well acted and touching.The plot is completely preposterous, but that's to be expected from a movie based on comic books. It's still entertaining. The gadgets are impressive, the action scenes are well done, and the Batmobile, as always, is cool. The lead actresses, Elle MacPherson, Alicia Silverstone, and Uma Thurman, are talented and very easy on the eyes. Uma Thurman, as the evil Poison Ivy, possesses a magic powder that will make men do anything for her. This seems redundant to me, since her sexy costumes alone are enough to make men do anything for her.If I had to choose a worst out of the Batman movies, I'd pick this one. Still, it's light entertainment, and worth a look.",not that bad,not that great either most bad things youve heard about this movie are true but that doesnt stop film being entertaining seeing batman arnold schwarzenegger duke it out is reason enough see batman robin but while schwarzenegger as mr freeze carries impressive weapons strikes menacing figure his lines are cheesy instead threatening fact cheesier lines havent been heard since adam west played batman george clooney makes likable super hero unfortunately hes not really batman batman is tormented by inner demons george clooney never stops smiling even though adam wests lines as batman were unbelievable he still said them with straight face as if they were serious george clooney says even serious lines with cheesy grin hes believable as rich playboy bruce wayne but even though his attempt get batman lighten up was noble idea character should be played with some darkness still theres great warmness between clooney michael gough who plays alfred butler between clooney chris odonnel who plays robin boy wonder bruce waynes personal life is turmoil alfred his friend mentor is dying bruce must cope with idea that he might lose him robin is tired standing batmans shadow begins jeopardize dynamic duos partnership both subplots are well acted touching plot is completely preposterous but thats be expected movie based comic books its still entertaining gadgets are impressive action scenes are well done batmobile as always is cool lead actresses elle macpherson alicia silverstone uma thurman are talented very easy eyes uma thurman as evil poison ivy possesses magic powder that will make men do anything her this seems redundant me since her sexy costumes alone are enough make men do anything her if i had choose worst out batman movies id pick this one still its light entertainment worth look,0.6537037037037036,0.10233333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.36}"
5,"Not completely bad, but not very good","I hope Tim Burton takes over the Batman movie series. If WB didn't learn their lesson after this one, they never will. Batman Forever I liked, but it foreshadowing this movie, which turned the once cool, dark, Batman-worthy Burton version into a glow-in-the-dark, kiddy-show, campy version. I still say this movie is OK, but if something isn't done about Joel, I won't be saying this for much longer.Here we go...Batman: I am so surprised that everyone says that George Clooney is the best part of this movie. He is the worst Batman in my opinion.(I think Kilmer was the best) Clooney isn't that bad, but I didn't think he fit. And the Batman Credit Card? I wanted to puke in my popcorn when I saw that!Robin: Robin reminds me a lot of Luke Skywalker, minus the coolness. Chris O'Donnell plays the part well. Unfortunately, the part is a whiny, annoying, untrustworthy, gullible, stupid sidekick. Don't bother defending Robin, he isn't worth it. He was OK in Batman Forever, but his character isn't improving.Batgirl: You know, we really didn't need another sidekick right away, did we? Why Batgirl now? Save her for number 6, for crying out loud! Alicia Silverstone is great (though not in this movie) but that doesn't hide the fact that the character shouldn't be there. And the constant battle of the sexes between her and Robin are annoying.Mr. Freeze: Ugh. The only thing that saved this character was the fact that it was Arnold, and that didn't save it. I won't forgive Joel for putting a great guy like Arnold into a crappy role like this. Yeah, his thing was ice, but that doesn't mean EVERY LINE OVER 5 SENTENCE (no exaggeration) had to be an ice pun!Poison Ivy: The thing that really saved this movie. Uma Thurman did a great acting job for this part, despite some other opinions. She was very sexy and interesting, unlike Mr. Freeze. In some parts, you were waiting to get back to her scenes. This was the only interesting villain in the movie.Bane: I am stunned at Joel's ability to take a cool villain from the comics like Bane and turn him into a drooling, stupid, grunt-like idiot. I am too disgusted to talk about it.Alfred: Alfred is just as good as always in this movie, although it is getting annoying how he wants everyone he knows to be one of Batmans sidekicks.Commishoner Gordan: You know, in Batman you had respect for this guy. Now his only scenes are when he drools over Poison Ivy. Sad.Overall, Uma Thurman's sexy role in this movie alone is enough for you to watch this movie. To die by getting kissed by Uma, what a great way to die! :)",not completely bad but not very good,i hope tim burton takes over batman movie series if wb didnt learn their lesson after this one they never will batman forever i liked but it foreshadowing this movie which turned once cool dark batman worthy burton version into glow dark kiddy show campy version i still say this movie is ok but if something isnt done about joel i wont be saying this much longer here we go batman i am so surprised that everyone says that george clooney is best part this movie he is worst batman my opinion i think kilmer was best clooney isnt that bad but i didnt think he fit batman credit card i wanted puke my popcorn when i saw that robin robin reminds me lot luke skywalker minus coolness chris odonnell plays part well unfortunately part is whiny annoying untrustworthy gullible stupid sidekick dont bother defending robin he isnt worth it he was ok batman forever but his character isnt improving batgirl you know we really didnt need another sidekick right away did we why batgirl now save her number 6 crying out loud alicia silverstone is great though not this movie but that doesnt hide fact that character shouldnt be there constant battle sexes between her robin are annoying mr freeze ugh only thing that saved this character was fact that it was arnold that didnt save it i wont forgive joel putting great guy like arnold into crappy role like this yeah his thing was ice but that doesnt mean every line over 5 sentence no exaggeration had be ice pun poison ivy thing that really saved this movie uma thurman did great acting job this part despite some other opinions she was very sexy interesting unlike mr freeze some parts you were waiting get back her scenes this was only interesting villain movie bane i am stunned at joels ability take cool villain comics like bane turn him into drooling stupid grunt like idiot i am too disgusted talk about it alfred alfred is just as good as always this movie although it is getting annoying how he wants everyone he knows be one batmans sidekicks commishoner gordan you know batman you had respect this guy now his only scenes are when he drools over poison ivy sad overall uma thurmans sexy role this movie alone is enough you watch this movie die by getting kissed by uma what great way die,0.6118192342248947,0.06060975188333681,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.19}"
1,Holy Cr**py Movie Batman!!!!!,"This is the most disappointing movie in the history of film for me.A 2 out of 10 is generous. I should give it a zero strictly based on the Bat Credit Card scene. Every single individual whether it be producers, director, writer or actors (minus Chris O'Donnell) should be ""Bat-Whipped"" for this piece of junk. This is your typical ""absolutely cannot fail"" franchise in film getting raped by studio execs making critical content decisions about a film when they have no talent to do so. Batman is popular simply because of the comic book not because of that retarded TV show starring Adam West, but this movie is more fashioned after that campy trash. This was nothing but a slap in the face to every true fan of the Batman. The direction of Joel Schumacher was deplorable. The set designs looked cheap (the ice looked and acted like dried craft glue) and were visually painful, especially the overuse of the red neon hue in many scenes. The digital effects were OK but often over done. The production cost was extensive, and I wonder what percentage of the budget went to the salaries of Arnold, George, Uma and Alicia. I'm sure it was high. I know Arnold got $20 million, so the percentage had to be fairly high. Well, everyone one of them needed to give back large portions of their salaries because their performances were atrocious. Alicia Silverstone needs to give her entire salary back. Hers was probably one the worst performances ever in a major motion picture. Arnold can't act anyway so I wasn't really expecting much, but I was disappointed when I heard he was cast as Freeze because he in no way fits that character. Freeze was a scientist and when I look at Arnold my first thought is not ""Scientist"". Ben Kingsly or Patrick Stewart would have fit better. Uma, who is normally a credible actress, was too ""drama queen"" which made it hard to immerse yourself in scenes she was in. Clooney was totally miscast as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I mean it's hard not to laugh when Batman is shorter than Robin. George like Uma was too overly dramatic, especially in scenes with Alfred, which made it hard to take him seriously. Chris O'Donnell was really the only actor that seemed real. With all that, I would have to say the overwhelmingly worst part of this movie was the script. Akiva Goldsman should have been banned from Hollywood after this script. It was a completely brainless jumbled mess. The story, which was pitiful at best, gets completely lost in entirely too many characters. It was so frustrating seeing the origins of certain characters ripped too shreds as Goldsman attempted to jam them into the script. Batgirl, who should have never been in this film in the first place, was changed from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece, which made absolutely no sense. In an attempt, to explain why Freeze was so muscular it was explained he was an Olympic gymnast. How freakin' stupid is that? Gymnasts by necessity need to be small in stature to perform well in gymnastics and Arnold is enormous. Goldsman's use of dialogue was highly irritating consisting of nothing but one juvenile one-liner after another after another after another. One other thing that really irritated me was the complete mishandling and waste of the character Bane. Bane is a much more complex and vicious villain in the comics, and this movie version with Bane reduces him to a mindless henchman. Bane deserves much more character development than he received in B&R. The same thing happened in Forever, when one of the most highly complex and interesting villains in the comics, Two-Face, got reduced to second billing. Note to Warner Bros. stop screwing with Batman he can sell himself, and stop trying to cram so many characters into the films, and understand nobody wants to see a Campy Caped Crusader.",holy cr py movie batman,this is most disappointing movie history film me 2 out 10 is generous i should give it zero strictly based bat credit card scene every single individual whether it be producers director writer or actors minus chris odonnell should be bat whipped this piece junk this is your typical absolutely cannot fail franchise film getting raped by studio execs making critical content decisions about film when they have no talent do so batman is popular simply because comic book not because that retarded tv show starring adam west but this movie is more fashioned after that campy trash this was nothing but slap face every true fan batman direction joel schumacher was deplorable set designs looked cheap ice looked acted like dried craft glue were visually painful especially overuse red neon hue many scenes digital effects were ok but often over done production cost was extensive i wonder what percentage budget went salaries arnold george uma alicia im sure it was high i know arnold got 20 million so percentage had be fairly high well everyone one them needed give back large portions their salaries because their performances were atrocious alicia silverstone needs give her entire salary back hers was probably one worst performances ever major motion picture arnold cant act anyway so i wasnt really expecting much but i was disappointed when i heard he was cast as freeze because he no way fits that character freeze was scientist when i look at arnold my first thought is not scientist ben kingsly or patrick stewart would have fit better uma who is normally credible actress was too drama queen which made it hard immerse yourself scenes she was clooney was totally miscast as bruce wayne batman i mean its hard not laugh when batman is shorter than robin george like uma was too overly dramatic especially scenes with alfred which made it hard take him seriously chris odonnell was really only actor that seemed real with all that i would have say overwhelmingly worst part this movie was script akiva goldsman should have been banned hollywood after this script it was completely brainless jumbled mess story which was pitiful at best gets completely lost entirely too many characters it was so frustrating seeing origins certain characters ripped too shreds as goldsman attempted jam them into script batgirl who should have never been this film first place was changed commissioner gordons daughter alfreds niece which made absolutely no sense attempt explain why freeze was so muscular it was explained he was olympic gymnast how freakin stupid is that gymnasts by necessity need be small stature perform well gymnastics arnold is enormous goldsmans use dialogue was highly irritating consisting nothing but one juvenile one liner after another after another after another one other thing that really irritated me was complete mishandling waste character bane bane is much more complex vicious villain comics this movie version with bane reduces him mindless henchman bane deserves much more character development than he received b r same thing happened forever when one most highly complex interesting villains comics two face got reduced second billing note warner bros stop screwing with batman he can sell himself stop trying cram so many characters into films understand nobody wants see campy caped crusader,0.5264056956115779,-0.01860224089635853,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8,What is wrong with 'camp'?,"One thing that strikes me from reading these reviews is that people have sadly forgotten how to appreciate 'camp'. Back in the '60's, camp was in vogue, thanks to the 'Batman' television series, as well as movies such as 'Our Man Flint/In Like Flint' and Dean Martin's 'Matt Helm' series ( which began with 'The Silencers' ).What is camp? It is a ridiculous story approached with deadly seriousness on the part of the main characters, so serious in fact that it becomes amusing.So, yes, 'Batman & Robin' is campy. And that's how I like the Caped Crusader. Taken seriously, I find him a bit of a bore. So many modern movies are 'dark' now that I have to take a flashlight every time I visit the local multiplex. 'B & R' was the third sequel to the 1989 Tim Burton blockbuster, which starred Michael Keaton. Both left the series at the same time. Their replacements were Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer. Schumacher retained the dark, brooding atmosphere of the Burton films, while bringing in some of the colourful campery of the '60's series. He was ripped to pieces for doing so but I think he was right. Kilmer was an adequate replacement. George Clooney donned the cowl and cape for 'B & R ', and was better than Kilmer, but Keaton was still far and away the best. Warner Bros.' 'Batman' franchise was bound to run out of puff, and did. All franchises run out of puff in the end. James Bond did with 'The Man With The Golden Gun' in 1974. The less said about 'Superman 4: The Quest For Peace' the better. But they both recovered. Ditto 'Batman'. 'Batman Begins' could never have been made were it not for 'B & R '. The plot concerns 'Mr.Freeze' who is trying to save his dying wife by freezing Gotham City...something like that. It is not important. People who go to 'Batman' in search of great plots are fools.Arnold Schwarzenegger was miscast as 'Mr.Freeze' - the man cannot, and never could, act. Patrick Stewart should have gotten the role. Then there's Uma Thurman as 'Poison Ivy', a villain I'm not familiar with, but she was the best thing in the movie. Sexy, sassy and cool. This was how she should have been in 'The Avengers'. Alicia Silverstone as 'Batgirl'? Another mistake. 'Batgirl' is to 'Batman' what 'Scrappy Doo' is to 'Scooby Doo'. Chris O'Donnell reprised his role as 'Robin', but like 'Batgirl', I never could stand the character.As soon as the title of this film was announced, I thought: ""Oh oh trouble!"". Its so crass. 'Batman Supreme' would have been better.So with all these strikes against it, why is 'B & R' so much fun? Simple. For those of us who fondly remember the '60's version, it works perfectly as a homage. If you ask me, they should have gone further by putting 'Pow!', 'Zap!' and 'Kerpow!' on the fights. Nothing in the movie makes sense, nor is it meant to. Just as reality makes no sense. Don't go to 'B & R' expecting Fellini, and you'll have a great time. The opening chase alone is worth purchasing the D.V.D. for. To all the doom mongers, I say this - lighten up! Watch 'B & R' and enjoy. We can get 'dark' and 'edgy' movies anywhere. 'Batman' is not 'Seven'!",what is wrong with camp,one thing that strikes me reading these reviews is that people have sadly forgotten how appreciate camp back 60s camp was vogue thanks batman television series as well as movies such as our man flint like flint dean martins matt helm series which began with silencers what is camp it is ridiculous story approached with deadly seriousness part main characters so serious fact that it becomes amusing so yes batman robin is campy thats how i like caped crusader taken seriously i find him bit bore so many modern movies are dark now that i have take flashlight every time i visit local multiplex b r was third sequel 1989 tim burton blockbuster which starred michael keaton both left series at same time their replacements were joel schumacher val kilmer schumacher retained dark brooding atmosphere burton films while bringing some colourful campery 60s series he was ripped pieces doing so but i think he was right kilmer was adequate replacement george clooney donned cowl cape b r was better than kilmer but keaton was still far away best warner bros batman franchise was bound run out puff did all franchises run out puff end james bond did with man with golden gun 1974 less said about superman 4 quest peace better but they both recovered ditto batman batman begins could never have been made were it not b r plot concerns mr freeze who is trying save his dying wife by freezing gotham city something like that it is not important people who go batman search great plots are fools arnold schwarzenegger was miscast as mr freeze man cannot never could act patrick stewart should have gotten role then theres uma thurman as poison ivy villain im not familiar with but she was best thing movie sexy sassy cool this was how she should have been avengers alicia silverstone as batgirl another mistake batgirl is batman what scrappy doo is scooby doo chris odonnell reprised his role as robin but like batgirl i never could stand character as soon as title this film was announced i thought oh oh trouble its so crass batman supreme would have been better so with all these strikes against it why is b r so much fun simple those us who fondly remember 60s version it works perfectly as homage if you ask me they should have gone further by putting pow zap kerpow fights nothing movie makes sense nor is it meant just as reality makes no sense dont go b r expecting fellini youll have great time opening chase alone is worth purchasing d v d all doom mongers i say this lighten up watch b r enjoy we can get dark edgy movies anywhere batman is not seven,0.4905573593073594,0.15753517316017315,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
