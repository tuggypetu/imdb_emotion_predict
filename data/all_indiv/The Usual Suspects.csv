10.0,the American thriller of the nineties,"One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: ""the movies of the nineties"" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). For others it will be ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) while others will praise to the skies ""Se7en"" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, ""the Usual Suspects"" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches ""the Usual Suspects"" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch ""the Usual Suspects"" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this ""coup de theatre"" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, ""the Usual Suspects"" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening...",american thriller nineties,one day bookshop i flipped through book entitled movies nineties this movie wasnt included how can book specialized cinema skip such milestone last decade any movie buff any cinema critic must have considered nineties fruitful era american thriller according ones tastes some will say that best thriller nineties is silence lambs 1991 others it will be pulp fiction 1994 while others will praise skies se7en 1995 me pinnacle is this present movie usual suspects 1995 with its staggering story put it mildly its sensational debut bryan singer which enabled put him map with little help his accomplice christopher mcquarrie he signed unparalleled gem landscape american thriller even whole cinema average viewer who watches usual suspects first time might think that whole crew concocted him meandering story with as leading thread spaceys convoluted story at end projection he may feel puzzled will probably wish watch movie second time he wont regret it singer mcquarrie will rejoice at it their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings appreciate subtleties rich movie with convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form five last minutes watch usual suspects is like gathering pieces intriguing puzzle little like any other suspenseful movie but case singers flick one will never really be able completely end it so many things happen less than two hours that we are never really sure what we watch this is reinforced by breathtaking unexpected twist at end which makes our assumptions falter singer mcquarrie take mischievous delight taking viewer their nebulous scenario follow it according spaceys declarations its obvious that they raise more questions than answers its up viewer make his imagination work bring his thoughts film this is what inspires its pernicious charm spaceys story authors developed top quality script set with clockwork precision singers directorial style virtually evolutes razors edge conveys increasing tension it is filled with ingenious visual ideas served by fluid camera movements singer was his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents signs seasoned author theres also tight editing unsettling score which cement movie its place winner more remarkable authors pull off with gusto increase audiences curiosity throughout film spite somewhat deliberate confusion interest wont weaken until end which constitute apex unexpected twist which will leave audience speechless once they understood it singers flick it doesnt disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual verbal clues which justify it however it has something unsettling we believe that we are at end maze but theres more picture than meets eye maybe this coup de theatre veils one more truth maybe also shrewdest ones will have guessed it but result is same any viewer singer puts baffled spectator his pocket singer quarrie show perfect master domain film noir ominous atmosphere nocturnal scenes which stay rooted mind deep psychology certain characters which give more substance film considering last point character gabriel byrne is most interesting one former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself catering but caught up by his past forced come back work i personally think that byrne is stand out topflight cast movie boasts but dont neglect other members kevin spacey pocketed deservedly oscar 1996 rest cast doesnt stay bench maybe singer grants little shallow attention three others baddies gang but way its necessary underscore fact that theyre lousy gangsters embroiled infernal spiral unable perceive what lies beneath all this pete postlewhaite chazz palminteri make their scenes count too riveting storytelling painstaking flash back tight first class directing thoughtful twist topnotch cast usual suspects includes almost everything director would sell his soul everything contributes make it stalwart model suspenseful movie whole cinema after first vision be prepared mental gymnastics second screening,0.4140371007840888,0.09496557659208263,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,A stone cold CLASSIC!,"'The Usual Suspects' has received a lot of comment for its killer twist ending, which while by no means the first in movie history, has proved to be enormously influential (stand up Messrs. Fincher and Shyamalan...). But this movie is so much more than a surprise ending! It is a meticulously scripted, faultlessly acted masterpiece that stands up to repeated viewings. Every single time I watch it I notice some new detail, or get more enjoyment out of a performance or scene. This movie really put Kevin Spacey on the map, but everyone in the ensemble cast is outstanding, even Stephen Baldwin(!), who has never appeared in a movie this good before, or since. I also got a kick out of the Paul Bartel ( 'Death Race 2000', 'Eating Raoul') cameo, and the ultra-cool Peter Greene's ('Laws Of Gravity', 'Pulp Fiction') all too brief appearance. Bartel is sorely missed, and Greene one day (mark my words!) will become the star he deserves to be.Director Bryan Singer has yet to live up to the promise shown here with his subsequent movies, the average 'Apt Pupil' and the disappointing 'X-Men'. For all the acclaim he and the (admittedly superb) cast have received, the real star of 'The Usual Suspects' is Christopher McQuarrie's sensational script, one of the finest of the modern era, and one that genuinely deserved it's Oscar.It really doesn't get any better than this!! One of the greatest movies ever made, any time, any where.

9.0,I'm Glad I Finally Got a Chance to See It,"I don't know what the problem is. I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened. I thought that throughout the film we were in the loop, and even if we have an unreliable narrator, I suspected that from the start. Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a ""gimp."" There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying.",im glad i finally got chance see it,i dont know what problem is i had heard that this is incomprehensible film that when it ends we dont know what exactly happened i thought that throughout film we were loop even if we have unreliable narrator i suspected that start anyway its been long time since ive been taken such joyride with such interesting characters even if they are murderers felons plot is woven so delicately threat is so interesting that i was involved first minute i always wondered how kevin spacey rather ordinary looking guy with receding hairline got be so well known obviously this is reason his performance is right he dominates screen even though he is gimp there are so many layers this film but i dont think screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it it is quite satisfying,0.6199404761904762,0.13660714285714284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.52}"
10.0,The most enjoyment you'll have seeing a movie for the *second* time,"Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an ""epic,"" and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.",most enjoyment youll have seeing movie second time,ah usual suspects my personal favorite movie all time dont let my bias be fool perhaps its not best movie ever but its one that i never get tired if you like flash bikinis breath taking camera angles you wont find them here usual suspects is not epic it doesnt pretend be its modestly budgeted piece by fresh director who later went do x men movies far departure great gritty script beautifully acted characters what many have called greatest movie ending all time are some shining qualities that make usual suspects object worthy praise above its humble looking shell casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly gabriel byrne is convincing as ex con trying build new life when he gets drawn back into his old life stephen baldwin has role his career as smart mouthed cocky professional kevin pollak takes big departure his usual good comedy self take more dramatic role benicio del toro literally takes one dimensional character with absolutely nothing script give him character he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms memorable mumbling show incredible acting creativity kevin spacey as we know him was born this movie his manners fast talking yet shy gimp nature are treat listen throughout flick without giving away plot best most genius parts movie are subtleties after you see ending truth hits you like ton bricks you have watch it again second time through youll jump up point at screen whenever you spot clue you missed first time its even possible watch movie multiple times see something new with every viewing its that attention detail that make deceptively innocent looking usual suspects one greatest movies all time,0.540288328024177,0.20843420730213183,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,The Film That Made Kevin Spacey a Star,"""The Usual Suspects"" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can't watch just once. The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together in a police lineup. However, their mayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans to eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various ways during their checkered pasts. An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout. Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances. But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes ""The Usual Suspects"" work on all levels. This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in ""The Godfather, Part II"". 5 stars out of 5.",film that made kevin spacey star,usual suspects is complicated puzzle movie that i bet you cant watch just once film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together police lineup however their mayhem is interrupted by mysterious character named kaiser sose who plans eliminate all five crooks after they all crossed him various ways during their checkered pasts amazing original screenplay tight direction keep up substantial amount tension throughout gabriel byrne stephen baldwin benicio del toro kevin pollak pete postlethwaite chazz palminteri all give top notch performances but it is kevin spacey oscar winning part that makes usual suspects work all levels this part put him higher class actors can be compared robert deniros star making job godfather part ii 5 stars out 5,0.5654761904761905,0.08720238095238096,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Not enough good things to say,"Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie.

9.0,""" The Greatest Trick The Devil Ever Pulled""","Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****",greatest trick devil ever pulled,out mind christorpher mcqurrie comes this incredible story man search devil film is called usual suspects what could be more appropriate than unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual story originates with only survivor what police conclude was murderous explosive drug deal gone bad his name is roger kint kevin spacey is perfect also known as verbal mouth this innocent storytelling con artist comes fantastic tale how he his fellow criminals stephen baldwin is michael mcmanus benicio del toro is fred fenster kevin pollak as todd hockney were originally assembled then set up beginning with mix up by law enforcement put several guilty men together same line up tale proceeds cross country culminates with powerful but mysterious kingpin by name keyser soze its through his attorney kobayashi pete postlethwaite men learn they are marked death unless they undertake dangerous assignment center piece unusual group is their leader remarkable individual named dean keaton gabriel byrne incredible performance what transpires this movie moment moment is lesson sleigh hand what we police dave kujan chazz palminteri are told is not what we see conversely what we see is not what we have been told end this film with its haunting theme by john ottman is nothing short incredible superb classic both mystery action entertainment by bryan singer great film indeed,0.6377604166666667,0.2559895833333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,The Usual Suspects Certainly Defies Pigeon Holing or Labeling!,"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL ------------The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------SUSPECTS larger-than-life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Psychodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taut direction, by Bryan Singer. The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his ""supporting"" role!)But let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,""SUSPECTS"" is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.On a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames. The shadowy figure walks down the stairs with an unhurried deliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.Without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, strategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat. What better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmitigated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself.Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out, ""I p**s on you and your puny existence!"" His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die! ""SUSPECTS"" has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching ""SUSPECTS"" four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point!Let me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre because of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO Robert Rodriguez FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the ""Old School"" style, where the violence is kept off-screen. Although there is considerable TALK in ""SUSPECTS"" about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...10* STARS*! GET IT AND SEE IT!......

6.0,Stylish crime drama with little content,"[**Major spoilers**] This movie began on a sour note in the opening scene with a man on an upper floor pissing down onto a ribbon of flaming gasoline on a lower floor to put it out. Right off we know that there is going to have to be some major suspension of disbelief. The story line is not nearly as complicated as it is made out to be. Within the context of this movie, maybe that was a goal. I never did figure out what the deal was with the image of the rope heading into a rat's nest of junk that was shown several times.A real problem for me was that the two main thugs in this were not at all threatening. The final plot twist only furthered this dissonance - it was kind of like finding out that behind the mask of Darth Vader we find Pee-wee Herman. And I felt manipulated by the final twist (that was in fact somewhat anticipated, after all Verbal was smoking his cigarette in the Turkish style). Are we to believe that Verbal boarded the boat and changed into a fedora and black overcoat to perform the crucial murder? What was the point of that besides trying to fool the audience? And so many times in the exchanges between Verbal and Kujan, I felt I was watching actors rather than characters.The bottom line on this movie is that it is no more than a tricked out episode of ""Law and Order"" without offering anything substantial to think about after it's over.",stylish crime drama with little content,this movie began sour note opening scene with man upper floor pissing down onto ribbon flaming gasoline lower floor put it out right off we know that there is going have be some major suspension disbelief story line is not nearly as complicated as it is made out be within context this movie maybe that was goal i never did figure out what deal was with image rope heading into rats nest junk that was shown several times real problem me was that two main thugs this were not at all threatening final plot twist only furthered this dissonance it was kind like finding out that behind mask darth vader we find pee wee herman i felt manipulated by final twist that was fact somewhat anticipated after all verbal was smoking his cigarette turkish style are we believe that verbal boarded boat changed into fedora black overcoat perform crucial murder what was point that besides trying fool audience so many times exchanges between verbal kujan i felt i was watching actors rather than characters bottom line this movie is that it is no more than tricked out episode law order without offering anything substantial think about after its over,0.5795634920634921,0.0627579365079365,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.45}"

10.0,A Perfectly Crafted Mystery - (very ambiguous spoiler),"Kaiser Soze is a super-criminal of almost comic-book stature. Legendary among an underground of testosterone and nicotine-driven low-life 'usual suspects' of this film - Soze - remains unseen, fantastic, just outside of the camera's view, and detached from any reality we might call familiar or real. Nevertheless, he is the central character in the film, and the single force of will driving the entire film. The viewer, like the characters portrayed, must constantly ask 'Who is Kaiser Soze, does he even exist?"", and - as silly as it might seem - ""is he the devil himself?"". Soze's irresistible will is represented and enforced by an emissary (the stone-faced Pete Postlethwaite) who is just as cold-hearted as any of the hardened criminals who comprise 'The Usual Suspects'.The narrative begins and almost ends as a retrospective with just a bit of very necessary voice-over narrative by Spacey. His character - Verbal Kint - is interrogated by Palmintieri concerning the murder of several hardened criminals in a single night aboard Russian ship. Most of the major plot points are highlighted wonderfully by the changes of pace and camera work afforded by the shift between one plot - the events leading to Kint's interrogation - and another - the interrogation itself.Kint, physically disabled and emotionally disturbed, is himself a desperate, down-on-his luck, petty criminal whose chief talent seems to be getting mixed up with and attaching himself to more talented criminals. His latest 'friend' - Keating (Byrne) is a brilliant but depressive thief who is trying to straighten his life out for a woman lawyer he has fallen for. But along with the other 'usual suspects' - expert safe crackers, con men and sociopaths (possibly the best performance of Stephen Baldwin's career thus far) all - Keating is swept up into agreeing to do 'one final job'. In a fine piece of character interpetation, Byrne plays denial to the hilt telling himself that this job, if successful, could end his life in crime permanently. These expert thieves, con men and killers meet in a bogus police line-up one night and from that point on, they are bound together under the control of Soze until they either succeed or fail in the crime he has laid before them.Soze has been betrayed, whether directly or indirectly, by each of these men, and he leaves them all no choice. Accept the crime plan or die. They accept, knowing that their odds of success are, to say the least, very limited.The entire feeling of this film shifts radically from the action of the main plot (described in Kint's narrative) and the narrative itself (Kint's interrogation). While this may look simply like a clever piece of film work, it is actually a very brilliant plot device, as both story lines are finally united in the stunning and brilliant finish.While I am not usually a ready fan of mysteries, and even less interested in thrillers, this film was pure entertainment from start to finish.Director Singer has established himself as a pioneer in ensemble cast direction, and this film alone (his third) should have awarded him that title.The performances are, without exception, flawless. While flawlessness or some approximation of it is something I generally expect from people like Spacey, Byrne, and Del Toro, many of the folks in this film very much surprised me. I now watch out for folks like Kevin Pollak, for example. Without detracting from the performers whatsoever, some credit for the stunning quality of the performances must go to the director, editor, script and cinematography team. This film makes them all look positively great.I was bitterly disappointed by the fact that this film did not take many Academy Awards in its release year. While I realize that the academy's choices do not always reflect quality or achievement, I prefer to maintain at least a superficial guise of hopefulness. The fact that Usual Suspects did not win for editing was the biggest shock.

8.0,"At first, wasn't the biggest fan but.....","I couldn't help but set rather high expectations for 'The Usual Suspects' as I went into watching this. I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.Around 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again!

,A twisty classic,"After a gun fight on the docks leaves only one survivor with the majority dead, NYC agent Dave Kujan flies in to ensure that ex-cop Dean Keaton is really dead. During the questioning the survivor, Verbal Kint, tells of how events came to happen. Five criminals are brought together in a line up and decide to use the events to plan a job. However another survivor tells an extra story  one involving master criminal Kyser Soze. Kint reveals how the gang were forced into the fateful job by Soze  however who is Soze and why did the men try to steal what appears to be a ship load of drugs that didn't exist?When I first saw this I saw it in the cinema  the very next day I went back and watched it again. The plot starts with a cliff hanger and appears to gradually answer the mystery - however what it actually does is create more questions for every answer it appears to give. It does this without frustrating you or without confusing the issue  in fact you don't know right till the end that you've been caught in a story teller's web. The plot unfolds like a normal thriller but it is anything but.The strength of the film is in the writing but it is the direction that also manages to create a great mood. Singer uses clever shots weaving the story into a believable web of deceit. The cast add quality to every single line, every single scene. It's hard to imagine that the film could be the same with any one person changed.Bryne is great as Keaton, his world weary cop drawn into a plan he can't control  or is he the master behind it all. Spacey gives a great performance as our eyes and ears as he retells the events, he deservedly won an Oscar for this role  before he got all soft and started becoming a starring man. Baldwin has the film of his life (albeit not hard!), he's really good and should be lucky to get another good role. Even the minor roles in the gang are great  Del Toro's performance is even better when you knew why he did it that way. Likewise Pollack will never have a better role  he has genuine tension between him and Baldwin (even in later interviews the dislike still seems real  with things like Pollack telling Baldwin he's sorry that his brothers stole all the food from his table). Palminteri does a great performance and is totally convincing. Postlethwaite is good despite playing an Asian (?) lawyer. Suzi Amis is good in her brief role and Esposito is as good as he always is.Overall I could talk for hours about this film. It's rare for films now to have decent plots worth talking about however this manages it  it's still twisty and impressive no matter how many times you watch it.",twisty classic,after gun fight docks leaves only one survivor with majority dead nyc agent dave kujan flies ensure that ex cop dean keaton is really dead during questioning survivor verbal kint tells how events came happen five criminals are brought together line up decide use events plan job however another survivor tells extra story one involving master criminal kyser soze kint reveals how gang were forced into fateful job by soze however who is soze why did men try steal what appears be ship load drugs that didnt exist when i first saw this i saw it cinema very next day i went back watched it again plot starts with cliff hanger appears gradually answer mystery however what it actually does is create more questions every answer it appears give it does this without frustrating you or without confusing issue fact you dont know right till end that youve been caught story tellers web plot unfolds like normal thriller but it is anything but strength film is writing but it is direction that also manages create great mood singer uses clever shots weaving story into believable web deceit cast add quality every single line every single scene its hard imagine that film could be same with any one person changed bryne is great as keaton his world weary cop drawn into plan he cant control or is he master behind it all spacey gives great performance as our eyes ears as he retells events he deservedly won oscar this role before he got all soft started becoming starring man baldwin has film his life albeit not hard hes really good should be lucky get another good role even minor roles gang are great del toros performance is even better when you knew why he did it that way likewise pollack will never have better role he has genuine tension between him baldwin even later interviews dislike still seems real with things like pollack telling baldwin hes sorry that his brothers stole all food his table palminteri does great performance is totally convincing postlethwaite is good despite playing asian lawyer suzi amis is good her brief role esposito is as good as he always is overall i could talk hours about this film its rare films now have decent plots worth talking about however this manages it its still twisty impressive no matter how many times you watch it,0.4941374663072776,0.2213274932614555,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,Overrated! SPOILERS AHEAD!,"I'd heard people say what a great movie ""The Usual Suspects"" was for a long time, but never got around to watching it...until tonight. I discovered it was available to watch instant stream on Netflix and decided to go ahead and give it a go. I've got to say, I'm pretty disappointed in it.Once again, I feel I fell victim to hype. People hyped this movie up to be awesome, and I just don't think it was. In my opinion, the movie was OK at best.The performances were all good. It's just that the movie was so slow...I couldn't believe that it's running time was a slim one hour and forty-five minutes. It felt like it was about two hours and twenty minutes to me.Then, I just felt the ""big reveal"" at the end was a little hokey. I mean, if you're that great of a criminal mastermind you would've had your BS story made up long before you ever entered an interrogation room -- for Kevin Spacey's character to have supposedly come up with the details for his story based off what he'd seen on a bulletin board...I'm sorry, but I've got to cry foul! If you've already got the story made up, you're not going to need to find inspiration for names of characters off a bulletin board, but I realize if he hadn't have gotten the names off the bulletin board, the audience wouldn't have really known he was lying the whole time. I get that, but I think the ending requires too much suspension of disbelief.I'm sure most people who like this movie like it because of its ending. Maybe if you take it for what it is, at a surface level, it might work...but once you start digging a little deeper and actually think about what you've just watched...it's not that great of an ending.I'll give it some credit for trying to go a different way than most movies of its type do, but that's about all I can really give it credit for. The movie itself was just really slow and didn't really pay off in the end, in my opinion, anyway.I'd give it maybe a five out of ten. That's about all the more I think it deserves. It wasn't GREAT, it wasn't HORRIBLE...it was just OK.You can check it out if you want to, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd recommend it.

,Better than the sum of its parts,"The Usual Suspects is two movies in one. Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round. The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer. It requires a certain amount of commitment, though. Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.It concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea. The plot is rather intricate so I shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before. That's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.Gabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie. Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger 'Verbal' Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic. The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze's right-hand man. He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts.",better than sum its parts,usual suspects is two movies one enjoyable first time you watch it even more enjoyable second time round first viewing asks questions that are answered i could kick myself moment final few minutes second viewing is interesting because when you know answers film becomes that much clearer it requires certain amount commitment though be warned if you stop concentrating moment then remaining running time movie will be spent trying figure out how what you missed has lead what you are now watching it concerns story five felons brought by police line up how those same felons reluctantly end up working mysterious ghost like keyser soze legend among criminal fraternity man who no one has seen lived man so dangerous that he is thought be devil himself you get idea plot is rather intricate so i shant bother explain it here but it does rather make me think that christopher mcquarrie writer kept going office morning with yet another complexity add that he thought up night before thats not say it doesnt work far it but it does leave you reeling sheer amount information names thrown at you offset gabriel byrne is good but not flawless as tortured dean keaton who is torn between his career as criminal his forlorn attempt at trying go straight but his relationship with uptown lawyer edie finneran suzy amis is badly explored i never felt it gave motive enough his actions throughout movie kevin spacey is wonderful as crippled roger verbal kint is effective with results both cunning tragic real star movie however is strangely accented pete postlethwaite as kobayashi supposedly keyser sozes right hand man he effortlessly plays character terrible coolness poker faced efficiency leading dance that rest characters must follow director bryan singer has done well bring such momentous involved screenplay life any gripes i may have cannot detract fact that film as whole is much better than sum its parts,0.5298840048840048,0.052564102564102586,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.46}"
6.0,Relies too much on its twist,"The Usual Suspects only works because of its infamous twist ending. Until then, it is simply a convoluted mess that does not offer any ways to resolve its twisting and unreliable plot threads. Films with plot twists work well if they are enjoyable up until the revelation, like The Sixth Sense (1999) or The Prestige (2006). They offer enough mystery to tease a potential revelation and enough clues to figure it out. The Usual Suspects, however, revels in sheer incomprehensibility and hollowness that necessarily demands an explanation to appreciate even at a basic level. Even afterwards, the revelation clearly exists more for the audience's emotional reaction rather than making any sense within the scenario of the film.

6.0,"Excellent production, but relies WAY too much on the surprise ending--which may not even be a surprise.","This film is basically a dark, sophisticated 'caper' thriller with the added twist that the main characters are rapidly awakened to the fact that they are being ruthlessly manipulated behind the scenes. The deeper they go, the more intense the experience. While none of these guys are admirable (in fact they are all clearly trash), you can't help but feel for them. They are just so in over their heads. And the puppeteer bad guy is a nightmare.Unfortunately I guessed its 'big secret' almost as soon as I knew there was one, and am justly disappointed. It was nice to keep getting confirmation as it went along, but I would like to have experienced the final surprise. (And I am *sure* I'm not singular in guessing the ending.)This film really relies too much on the 'wow effect' to make its major impression (read other comments for confirmation)--always a clue that a work of art is leaning *hard* on a crutch. Take away the surprise ending, and what do you have? In this case a stylish and well-produced film with a gaping hole. For example, compare it to LA Confidential. Even if you had guessed LAs secret before they let it out, it wouldn't spoil a thing--because that film didn't rely on a plot twist for its primary punch. It had a whole basket full of assets.I'd give this movie a 7 if its secret had been better (and more creatively) guarded. As it stands, I give it a 6 for the excellence of the entire production and that fact that I was fairly well entertained. But I won't be watching it again, whereas LA Confidential will always be on my list.********ABSOLUTE SPOILER *************** Agatha Christie first introduced this gimmick in 1926 with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.  Beyond that, the whole gig follows the classic mystery formula right down the line: Once we realize it's a whodunit (its clearly gotta be somebody we met, otherwise no punch), the obvious choice is the 'least likely one.' And there he is, perfectly disguised to fool you into not even looking his way--a good indication you should look his way. Another giveaway is that we have one guy telling the story and everything we see is from his eyes. Makes you wonder: 1) Why did only this guy survive? 2) Who says we are seeing the truth, except him?

10.0,"""and like that...he was gone.""","Boasting petty criminal characters conceived so brilliantly they achieve near-mythological status, The Usual Suspects is known for riveting suspense and action, an intriguing plot line and a jaw- dropping twist at the end. It also features some of the most memorable lines of the 1990s: ""How do you shoot the devil in the back--what if you miss?"" The characters, Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) have real character details and cues.The film is set in the aftermath of a ship fire that totally burns the cargo and crew. Though meek and disabled, Verbal is the only survivor to walk away from the incident unscathed. He is taken into custody and grilled by the police. Brilliantly played in a characteristic, understated style that earned Spacey an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Verbal is cleared and allowed to leave. But before he can go, agent Kujan from US Customs shows up to interrogate him. Kujan is trying to build a case against Keaton and he wants Verbal to testify in exchange for immunity. Verbal refuses, but Kujan still bullies Verbal into recounting his story of Keaton, McManus, Fenster and Hockney, leading up to the explosion on the ship. What follows is a fantastic yarn of lies and half-truths sprinkled within the facts of the case. It is all masterfully portrayed as a series of flashbacks while Verbal and Kujan sip coffee and talk in the LA police station. The story begins six weeks earlier in New York City as Verbal and the other four criminals are brought in to stand side-by-side in a police lineup. None of them are formally charged with a crime, and there are indications Keaton has actually gone straight prior to the roundup. But before they are released, the five hatch a plan to get revenge on the corrupt NYPD and make a large sum of money in the process by robbing a police-protected jewel smuggler and leaking news of the police involvement to the press. Keaton is reluctant and must be coaxed into it with the promise that no one will be killed in the heist. He agrees and the quintet pulls off the robbery to perfection. The acting and writing take chances that pay off, with each actor fully immersing himself in his role. Del Toro creates a uniquely colorful persona in his portrayal of Fenster, Baldwin conveys a reckless abandon and lust for violence, Pollak shows steely courage and resolve, Byrne is a complex mesh of toughness with motives pulling him in all directions. Each actor is at the top of his game. The five criminals go to Los Angeles to lay low in the aftermath of the New York heist. There, they are enticed into another robbery that is also supposed to involve no killing. Unfortunately, this LA heist goes horribly wrong. As Verbal recounts this carnage, its aftermath and the growing problems and hostility in the crew, agent Kujan receives a tip from one of his colleagues who has a survivor pulled from the water near the charred wreckage of the ship. The witness is badly burned and cannot speak English, but insists that the man responsible for the destruction of life and property on the ship is named Kaiser Soze. Whether it is attributable to lies in Verbal's yarn or odd casting decisions, several characters in The Usual Suspects add to the film's mystique. Chief among these is the Irish Postlethwaite cast as the Japanese Kobayashi. There is a strong clue at the end that the name Kobayashi is used solely to mislead Kujan. But Kobayashi is not the only instance of a character's name failing to match his appearance. Another example is McManus' contact in LA, Redfoot, which one would expect to be the name of a Native American. But Redfoot appears to be caucasian. Again, at the end there is an indication that Verbal used Redfoot to avoid giving Kujan a real name. Strange ethnic inconsistencies crop up constantly. Kaiser Soze is said to be Turkish, possibly with a German father. These mixed-up character portraits add a layer of complexity to the plot, but one must always consider the source, Verbal Kint, and his motives. The dynamic between Kujan and Verbal itself is pure entertainment. A kind of cat-and-mouse game, nuances are thrown into the proceedings that make it more interesting and add depth to the characters. Even the way the interrogation is filmed is unique. Verbal didn't achieve his nickname for no reason. He knows how to run his mouth and Kujan has a difficult challenge in corralling him. Underlying the interrogation is Kujan's suspicion of Keaton and his belief that Keaton manipulated Verbal. But Verbal is hard to pin down and Kujan occasionally resorts to bully tactics. But who is Kaiser Soze? Did he orchestrate the police lineup in New York, and pull all the strings ever since? Is the cargo of the ship drugs or only human cargo? Why did Verbal survive unharmed while so many others did not? Did Keaton really die, as Verbal insists, or did he slip away, as Kujan believes? Is Verbal telling the truth? Much is revealed in the final moments of the film, which wash over the viewer like an enormous wave of recognition. Snippets of dialogue from earlier in the film are montaged over the complex score, providing spine-tingling clues about exactly what part of Verbal's yarn was fact and what was fiction. The final snippet of dialogue, followed by a fortissimo string finale is especially powerful: ""and like that...he was gone.""",like that he was gone,boasting petty criminal characters conceived so brilliantly they achieve near mythological status usual suspects is known riveting suspense action intriguing plot line jaw dropping twist at end it also features some most memorable lines 1990s how do you shoot devil back what if you miss characters roger verbal kint kevin spacey dean keaton gabriel byrne michael mcmanus stephen baldwin fred fenster benicio del toro todd hockney kevin pollak dave kujan chazz palminteri kobayashi pete postlethwaite have real character details cues film is set aftermath ship fire that totally burns cargo crew though meek disabled verbal is only survivor walk away incident unscathed he is taken into custody grilled by police brilliantly played characteristic understated style that earned spacey academy award best supporting actor verbal is cleared allowed leave but before he can go agent kujan us customs shows up interrogate him kujan is trying build case against keaton he wants verbal testify exchange immunity verbal refuses but kujan still bullies verbal into recounting his story keaton mcmanus fenster hockney leading up explosion ship what follows is fantastic yarn lies half truths sprinkled within facts case it is all masterfully portrayed as series flashbacks while verbal kujan sip coffee talk la police station story begins six weeks earlier new york city as verbal other four criminals are brought stand side by side police lineup none them are formally charged with crime there are indications keaton has actually gone straight prior roundup but before they are released five hatch plan get revenge corrupt nypd make large sum money process by robbing police protected jewel smuggler leaking news police involvement press keaton is reluctant must be coaxed into it with promise that no one will be killed heist he agrees quintet pulls off robbery perfection acting writing take chances that pay off with each actor fully immersing himself his role del toro creates uniquely colorful persona his portrayal fenster baldwin conveys reckless abandon lust violence pollak shows steely courage resolve byrne is complex mesh toughness with motives pulling him all directions each actor is at top his game five criminals go los angeles lay low aftermath new york heist there they are enticed into another robbery that is also supposed involve no killing unfortunately this la heist goes horribly wrong as verbal recounts this carnage its aftermath growing problems hostility crew agent kujan receives tip one his colleagues who has survivor pulled water near charred wreckage ship witness is badly burned cannot speak english but insists that man responsible destruction life property ship is named kaiser soze whether it is attributable lies verbals yarn or odd casting decisions several characters usual suspects add films mystique chief among these is irish postlethwaite cast as japanese kobayashi there is strong clue at end that name kobayashi is used solely mislead kujan but kobayashi is not only instance characters name failing match his appearance another example is mcmanus contact la redfoot which one would expect be name native american but redfoot appears be caucasian again at end there is indication that verbal used redfoot avoid giving kujan real name strange ethnic inconsistencies crop up constantly kaiser soze is said be turkish possibly with german father these mixed up character portraits add layer complexity plot but one must always consider source verbal kint his motives dynamic between kujan verbal itself is pure entertainment kind cat mouse game nuances are thrown into proceedings that make it more interesting add depth characters even way interrogation is filmed is unique verbal didnt achieve his nickname no reason he knows how run his mouth kujan has difficult challenge corralling him underlying interrogation is kujans suspicion keaton his belief that keaton manipulated verbal but verbal is hard pin down kujan occasionally resorts bully tactics but who is kaiser soze did he orchestrate police lineup new york pull all strings ever since is cargo ship drugs or only human cargo why did verbal survive unharmed while so many others did not did keaton really die as verbal insists or did he slip away as kujan believes is verbal telling truth much is revealed final moments film which wash over viewer like enormous wave recognition snippets dialogue earlier film are montaged over complex score providing spine tingling clues about exactly what part verbals yarn was fact what was fiction final snippet dialogue followed by fortissimo string finale is especially powerful like that he was gone,0.45646624047786843,0.07585783079969127,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,Magnificent film that deserves to be re-watched over and over,"As an avid cinephile, who watches a lot of films to help me to be distracted from the pressures of everyday life, old and new and of all genres (have never had a bias against any genre and never love older films and dismiss new films, or vice versa), 'The Usual Suspects' was one of the finest films personally seen in a while.Other films to have that effect on me (and garnered 10/10 ratings, a rare rating for me these days) are 'LA Confidential', 'Amores Perros', Orson Welles' version of 'The Trial', 'City of God' and 'The Song of Bernadette', though some films came close as well as re-watches of favourites like 'Se7en', 'Much Ado About Nothing' (1993) and 'The Remains of the Day'. Simply put, 'The Usual Suspects' is a magnificent film all round that deserves to be re-watched over and over again, one of the few films seen recently to not find any fault with it. Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.Film is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.It has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.Overall, magnificent film in every sense. Recommended with no hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",magnificent film that deserves be re watched over over,as avid cinephile who watches lot films help me be distracted pressures everyday life old new all genres have never had bias against any genre never love older films dismiss new films or vice versa usual suspects was one finest films personally seen while other films have that effect me garnered 10 10 ratings rare rating me these days are la confidential amores perros orson welles version trial city god song bernadette though some films came close as well as re watches favourites like se7en much ado about nothing 1993 remains day simply put usual suspects is magnificent film all round that deserves be re watched over over again one few films seen recently not find any fault with it fully deserving its reputation as one best modern perhaps overall films ever made not everybody is going disagree that is fine usual suspects is slickly audaciously made filmed with lot style is atmospherically directed it is also hauntingly scored it is intricately intelligently written by christopher mcquarrie some best screen writing he ever did it is beautifully deftly directed by bryan singer if remembered correctly neither mcquarrie or singer were well known at time it was usual suspects that put them map film is famous iconic line up scene noticeboard that haunts everybody forever its killer twist one ages not one forget long one twists have wildly varied film there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones usual suspects is one ingenious ones usual suspects as said before doesnt just have its twist going it flashback packed story is similarly intricate never feels muddled or convoluted it has some finest ensemble acting there has ever been this is especially true mesmerising kevin spacey one most deserved oscar wins that year spacey is just one all round brilliant performances pete postelthwaite always dependable actor who is still very much missed is suitably mysterious dan hedaya chazz palminteri make their mark as confused cops steven baldwin doesnt have particularly challenging role but has never been better gabriel byrne is also solid overall magnificent film every sense recommended with no hesitation 10 10 bethany cox,0.5048974924446623,0.2130388793596341,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,A Modern Masterpiece...,"DISCLAIMER: Not seen 'The Usual Suspects' yet? Then don't waste any time reading this! Rent it, buy it, borrow it, I don't mind, but watch it before you bother reading any further.One of the main reasons that 'The Usual Suspects' leaves such a long-lasting impression on the viewer is that it takes advantage of the gullibility of the audience. For the first 100 minutes we are delivered an intriguing and complex story to which there seems no easy answer. When the final piece of the puzzle seems to be in place the entire film is turned on its head. This final revelation initially leaves you speechless and then shortly after the audience realises that they have fallen for a brilliantly inspired trick. The second great trick that this film plays on its audience is making us think that by watching it again we'll be able to understand slightly better what was really going on. The truth is that the more you try to make sense of it, the more confusing it becomes. It's probably best not to try to look for any concrete answers and just accept that we fell for the filmmaker's tricks. The success of the film is mainly thanks to the sense of satisfaction the audience is left with at the end of the film. I think that people love the idea of a story when you're not sure who you can really trust, along with the realisation that the film's most shady characters are the filmmakers themselves.Aside from the twist the film is also unique in the way the narrative is presented. The majority of the story is told as a series of flashbacks by crippled con artist Verbal Kint (a performance which deservedly won Kevin Spacey his first Oscar). The film's other Oscar went to screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed 'The Way of the Gun' (2000)) for his brilliantly constructed screenplay. It's a testament to the director, Bryan Singer that he was able to combine all these elements and turn them into something which is nothing short of a modern masterpiece. His moody and stylish direction help to bring the film together and perfectly complement the film's dark tone. A mention should also go to John Ottman for his skilful editing and amazing score.The Usual Suspects is more than just a film with a clever ending. It revealed an awful lot about film audiences and showed us that their expectations can be used against them. It is also a film about story telling and the importance of myth. I think that one of the most valuable lessons that filmmakers can learn from The Usual Suspects' is that the more interesting and intriguing your story is the more your audience will believe.The Usual Suspects was certainly not the first film to contain twist ending (the twist ending became one of Alfred Hitchcock's trademarks) and was certainly not the last ('The Sixth Sense' (1999) also used this technique effectively but left more subtle clues for the audience to pick up on their repeated viewings). Despite this 'The Usual Suspects' remains one of the most innovative and memorable crime thrillers of the nineties.",modern masterpiece,disclaimer not seen usual suspects yet then dont waste any time reading this rent it buy it borrow it i dont mind but watch it before you bother reading any further one main reasons that usual suspects leaves such long lasting impression viewer is that it takes advantage gullibility audience first 100 minutes we are delivered intriguing complex story which there seems no easy answer when final piece puzzle seems be place entire film is turned its head this final revelation initially leaves you speechless then shortly after audience realises that they have fallen brilliantly inspired trick second great trick that this film plays its audience is making us think that by watching it again well be able understand slightly better what was really going truth is that more you try make sense it more confusing it becomes its probably best not try look any concrete answers just accept that we fell filmmakers tricks success film is mainly thanks sense satisfaction audience is left with at end film i think that people love idea story when youre not sure who you can really trust along with realisation that films most shady characters are filmmakers themselves aside twist film is also unique way narrative is presented majority story is told as series flashbacks by crippled con artist verbal kint performance which deservedly won kevin spacey his first oscar films other oscar went screenwriter christopher mcquarrie who also directed way gun 2000 his brilliantly constructed screenplay its testament director bryan singer that he was able combine all these elements turn them into something which is nothing short modern masterpiece his moody stylish direction help bring film together perfectly complement films dark tone mention should also go john ottman his skilful editing amazing score usual suspects is more than just film with clever ending it revealed awful lot about film audiences showed us that their expectations can be used against them it is also film about story telling importance myth i think that one most valuable lessons that filmmakers can learn usual suspects is that more interesting intriguing your story is more your audience will believe usual suspects was certainly not first film contain twist ending twist ending became one alfred hitchcocks trademarks was certainly not last sixth sense 1999 also used this technique effectively but left more subtle clues audience pick up their repeated viewings despite this usual suspects remains one most innovative memorable crime thrillers nineties,0.4808776167471819,0.18490338164251208,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"Keaton always said, ""I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him."" Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.","The Usual Suspects is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor - leaving few survivors.It sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.The core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him.We are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.It all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.The advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10",keaton always said i dont believe god but im afraid him well i believe god only thing that scares me is keyser soze,usual suspects is directed by bryan singer written by christopher mcquarrie it stars gabriel byrne kevin spacey kevin pollack stephen baldwin benicio del toro chazz palminteri pete postlethwaite giancarlo esposito dan hedaya music is by john ottman cinematography by newton thomas sigel held l interrogation room verbal kint spacey attempts convince feds that mythic crime lord keyser soze not only exists but was also responsible drawing him his four partners into multi million dollar heist that ended with explosion san pedro harbor leaving few survivors it sort sidled into movie theatres 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices yet it wasnt long before word mouth got around that usual suspects might actually be must see film year fledgeling director writer singer mcquarrie produce masterclass crime mystery noir plotting whirl intricate plot shifts deft sleights hand core essence story is simple just who is keyser soze his reputation is one utter fear he may even be devil himself what transpires throughout film is number scenes told flashback form narrated by kint as cops put heat him we are introduced five criminals who make up suspects title where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour addition postlethwaites kobayashi character one sozes harbingers doom further ups ante storys deliciously corkscrew intrigue it all builds climax that has you pondering just what you have watched previously yet heres key as why pic still holds up repeat viewings we have been outsmarted as we dive enjoy across board great perfs we have been privy something that will stand test time genre it sits repeat viewings factor still some decades later is as strong as ever advent time home format releases etc have only improved pics own mythical status behind scenes egos dislikes set only add further strength characterisations as does one main man thinking he himself must be soze when fact he was way off theres trail clues film that will reveal who soze is who knew it goes usual suspects is filmic gift that keeps giving 10 10,0.6014991181657847,0.07530864197530864,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.43}"
1.0,Over-wrought.,"(major spoilers - plus, if you're a fan of the film, you won't like my review)I've never understood the fuss made over this movie - every time its been on TV i've watched the first five minutes, and rolled my eyes for various reasons (the first time it was Gabriel Byrne's accent, the other times it was how over-wrought everything was) and put something good on instead.I've finally given it the light of day tonight, to the end, and my feeling is this: one minute of cleverness at the end does not justify putting us through two hours of over-wrought actors playing at cops and robbers.The general situation is so very familiar - the crims who get together for one last job that goes wrong, and the way its told is not fresh either: the structure of the framing narrative in the present day and the flashbacks which take us back to a past event we want to learn the truth about, comes from Citizen Kane and Rashomon (ie, on its own does not make this movie original). The constant promise of a final mystery, which is intended to propel us to the end was invented by Orson Welles, and is a device used quite frequently (Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Go, Memento, The Exterminating Angel, and most movies, in fact).For two hours this is a lot of posing, actors dressed in ""slumming-it"" costumes straight from the costume designer's wardrobe, cliche dialogue, unbelievable situations, one unsustainable haircut, stubble and a lot of brooding ""i'm a criminal"" close-ups.There is a justified reason for all this falseness (aka pretentiousness), given in the final two minutes, which i can't even bring myself to say in case you haven't seen it and are still reading - i've had too many movies ruined for me. Save to say, like The Sixth Sense, this movie is a one-gimmick movie, and it takes watching it for two hours to find out that gimmick (which is the only possible explanation for characters having what i like to call Stephen King names, by which i mean they sound like someone has sat down and thought ""What's a really cool name i can make up?"" instead of names real people would have. Or possibly ""what's the wackiest name i can give a person and have the audience not laugh"" - if this was the case, they failed with me. Every time someone said ""Verbal Kint,"" ""Kobayashi,"" or ""Kaiser Sosay"" i couldn't help giggling) - i spent two hours rolling my eyes and two minutes saying ""yes, that's clever, but if people didn't equate twists with quality then i could have enjoyed the entire two hours - but it would not have been this movie, which is nothing without its gimmick. I had the same problem with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - i need more than one gimmick to keep me interested.",over wrought,major spoilers plus if youre fan film you wont like my review ive never understood fuss made over this movie every time its been tv ive watched first five minutes rolled my eyes various reasons first time it was gabriel byrnes accent other times it was how over wrought everything was put something good instead ive finally given it light day tonight end my feeling is this one minute cleverness at end does not justify putting us through two hours over wrought actors playing at cops robbers general situation is so very familiar crims who get together one last job that goes wrong way its told is not fresh either structure framing narrative present day flashbacks which take us back past event we want learn truth about comes citizen kane rashomon ie its own does not make this movie original constant promise final mystery which is intended propel us end was invented by orson welles is device used quite frequently citizen kane rashomon go memento exterminating angel most movies fact two hours this is lot posing actors dressed slumming it costumes straight costume designers wardrobe cliche dialogue unbelievable situations one unsustainable haircut stubble lot brooding im criminal close ups there is justified reason all this falseness aka pretentiousness given final two minutes which i cant even bring myself say case you havent seen it are still reading ive had too many movies ruined me save say like sixth sense this movie is one gimmick movie it takes watching it two hours find out that gimmick which is only possible explanation characters having what i like call stephen king names by which i mean they sound like someone has sat down thought whats really cool name i can make up instead names real people would have or possibly whats wackiest name i can give person have audience not laugh if this was case they failed with me every time someone said verbal kint kobayashi or kaiser sosay i couldnt help giggling i spent two hours rolling my eyes two minutes saying yes thats clever but if people didnt equate twists with quality then i could have enjoyed entire two hours but it would not have been this movie which is nothing without its gimmick i had same problem with eternal sunshine spotless mind i need more than one gimmick keep me interested,0.5455864197530864,0.0966358024691358,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Who is Keyser Söze?,"After a bloodbath and fire on a moored ship only the badly burned Hngarian mobster Arkosh Kovash (Morgan Hunter) and the crippled small- time crook Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) survive. Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogates Verbal that explains what happened to Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and him in the vessel. Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser Söze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser Söze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser Söze?Twenty-two years after the releasing date, ""The Usual Suspects"" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser Söze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie.
