10,The Raging Bull Named Rocky...,"""Rocky"" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, ""You have to be a moron to want to box.""Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before ""Rocky"" was ""Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,"" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in ""Rocky."" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.After he returns from his ""job"" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. ""An Italian found America,"" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.The most entertaining thing about ""Rocky"" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, ""Are you sure she knows I'm coming?"" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, ""This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!"" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.Things like that are what make ""Rocky"" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, ""Rocky"" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with ""Rocky"" all the more.",raging bull named rocky,rocky is about man it is story man who exceeds past all normal expectations makes most out what he is doing what is he doing boxing why as rocky says film you have be moron want box rocky is played by sylvester stallone whose only other film before rocky was weekend at kitty studs as you can probably guess by title it was x rated movie but stallone gives just about best performance his career here before he started getting into recycled action movies unfunny comedies man had talent as seen shining through rocky somewhere along way he lost that talent but its pretty evident that he had it at one time stallone wrote script which is about down his luck philadelphia man named rocky balboa rocky is your average tough guy you see walking down street but this film takes closer look into guy walking past you not at guy walking past you he lives beat up old apartment infested with roaches he barely makes enough money support himself his job rocky retrieves money loan sharks his real job however is break loaners thumbs if they dont pay up hes muscle man after he returns his job every day he takes time do what he has been doing past six years which is boxing then after that he takes trip local pet store see love his life adrian who works there he constantly tries impress her talk her but she is shy literally does not talk much throughout entire film but things change rocky after heavyweight champion apollo creed carl weathers decides that he wants make big performance 4th july he wants appear nice by letting regular joe schmoe fight him ring all show course as he is looking through book local boxers he points his finger at letters italian stallion k rocky he says that fighting italian is perfect italian found america creed says if he fights italian american 4th july it will be symbolic will also make creed look good but rocky doesnt realize this is all show when he receives word that apollo creed wishes fight him ring rocky begins train long hard with burgess meredith which results famous scene where rocky runs up entry stairs philly with music gonna fly now playing background this scene is spoofed by films world wide its one cornerstones film history you will see it all time its just one those film moments that are marked down history most entertaining thing about rocky is how innocent sylvester stallone comes across his role as rocky you feel him when he is trying impress adrian she shrugs him off scene where her brother invites rocky over rocky keeps saying are you sure she knows im coming is sign how guy has been put down then when she comes over his apartment he acts nice talks her hes not trying any moves her he just enjoys being with her rocky is bit idiot as he himself admits but hes sweet idiot end when rocky fights apollo creed is amazing nobody who actually stands chance against heavyweight champion world creed rocky are being battered by each other creed goes into opposite corner as rocky one creeds managers says this guy thinks this thing is real knock him out you feel sorry rocky there because he is giving fight all hes got when it was just publicity stunt beginning but he didnt even realize it things like that are what make rocky what it has become over years it is great film it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed films all time you should probably see it just that fact but truth is if you take away all underlying intricacies rocky is just story simple guy who gets chance do something amazing he gives it all hes got i think weve all gone through something like that before if so you will be able identify with rocky all more,0.4539156093503919,0.11396940418679552,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.38, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10,Yo!,"Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a struggling Italian/American boxer who also earns cash collecting debts for shady Philadelphian 'businessman' Gazzo (Joe Spinell). When heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) finds himself without an opponent for his upcoming match, he offers the unknown fighter a chance at the title as a gimmick, but doesn't count on Rocky's determination to go the distance.I watched Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull not that long ago, an excellent film, but something of a downerâ€”a gritty study of a not very nice character whose horrible personality and poor choices see him winding up losing everything. Rocky, on the other hand, is a real feel-good film about a guy on the skids who is given a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to make something of himself. It's an uplifting Cinderella story, a classic underdog tale that leaves the viewer with a big smile on their face, which is why I prefer it slightly over Scorsese's film.Rocky also has a great story behind the making of the film which mirrors that of its main character: star Stallone went from an almost broke struggling actor to Hollywood mega-star by not only writing the script for Rocky, but also insisting that he play the title role. The rest, as they say, is history.Those only familiar with Stallone's later action hero work will be surprised at how good an actor he is in his breakthrough role, tackling the drama just as well as the boxing: Rocky's burgeoning romance with shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire), his friendship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young), and his strained relationship with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) are all handled superbly.Director John G. Avildsen also manages all aspects of his film with aplomb, with the final fight between Rocky and Apollo being the absolute showstopper, a gruelling battle of wills, both combatants pushed to their limits. Add a rousing score from Bill Conti and what you have is an unmissable, uplifting classic of the '70s.9.5 out of 10, rounded up to 10 for IMDb.",yo,rocky balboa sylvester stallone is struggling italian american boxer who also earns cash collecting debts shady philadelphian businessman gazzo joe spinell when heavyweight boxing champion apollo creed carl weathers finds himself without opponent his upcoming match he offers unknown fighter chance at title as gimmick but doesnt count rockys determination go distance i watched martin scorseses raging bull not that long ago excellent film but something downer gritty study not very nice character whose horrible personality poor choices see him winding up losing everything rocky other hand is real feel good film about guy skids who is given once lifetime opportunity make something himself its uplifting cinderella story classic underdog tale that leaves viewer with big smile their face which is why i prefer it slightly over scorseses film rocky also has great story behind making film which mirrors that its main character star stallone went almost broke struggling actor hollywood mega star by not only writing script rocky but also insisting that he play title role rest as they say is history those only familiar with stallones later action hero work will be surprised at how good actor he is his breakthrough role tackling drama just as well as boxing rockys burgeoning romance with shy pet store clerk adrian talia shire his friendship with her brother paulie burt young his strained relationship with trainer mickey burgess meredith are all handled superbly director john g avildsen also manages all aspects his film with aplomb with final fight between rocky apollo being absolute showstopper gruelling battle wills both combatants pushed their limits add rousing score bill conti what you have is unmissable uplifting classic 70s 9 5 out 10 rounded up 10 imdb,0.51184012066365,0.08684012066365009,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,A classic! the best and the original movie of all time - Rocky !,"Rocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. And BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!!It is my first best favorite film in the series and I just love this film to death. It has a message and it is portraying a real human drama. Rocky is a movie that everyone can relate to. One of my favorite Stallone roles, there is nobody else who could play Rocky better than him, it's too bad that he didn't win Oscar because i honestly think that he deserved it. But at least movie won the best picture of the year award. Maybe Rocky didn't win the fight in the movie, but Stallone did win his ""fight"" in real life. Rocky, a poor guy that just barley manages to get by, just wants to fight. However, everyone including his trainer has given up on him. Rocky also wants to go on a date with Adrian, a very shy girl who works at the local pet store, Adrian, however, is too shy to even say anything to anyone. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (the heavy-weight champion of boxing) learns that his boxing partner has been injured and can't fight. Apollo tries all the other potential boxing partners, but every one of them refuse. Apollo decides to give an unknown boxer a chance to fight him for the title, with the intentions of just giving him five minutes of fame then knocking him out. Apollo picks Rocky. This is the Rocky's only shot at the big time and chance he will never get it back.Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a ""nobody"" to become a ""somebody"". The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time. Sylvester Stallone, himself a virtual unknown, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity - just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.The original Rocky film is one of the greatest epic action sport drama film in the history! It contains action, humor, romance, and an uplifting message. The screenplay is great, and features some truly touching moments. There is also some great camera work, thanks to the new Steadicam. It's a shame Stallone's later career and all the Rocky sequels have lessened this film in the eyes of many. This film is truly a classic and deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and both written by and starring Sylvester Stallone.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Chartoff-Winkler Productions, United Artists Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith Director: John G.

10,"""But it's Thanksgiving. Yeah to you, but to me it's Thursday.""","It's hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone's vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.Rocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn't like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn't so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It's about a guy, much like you or me, who's down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He's pushing 30, single and broke. I'm sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason. It's hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he's talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It's a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone's face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn't in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it's empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he's wasting his life. It's more than beautiful or real.It's safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God's help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I'd want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn't care. Because, ""I'm at least half a bum.""",but its thanksgiving yeah you but me its thursday,its hard explain what this movie means me words could never i remember when i was kid i never liked first rocky was too obsessed with iii iv it happened when i was 11 i went see v theater i never been movie like that before people were screaming cheering shook whole damn place they were dancing isles celebrating it was then i realized true power stallones vision realization that only original would ever really matter rocky me is so many things i had beg my girlfriend see it she said she doesnt like boxing i almost dumped her right there if she wasnt so hot i probably would have i was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing me it was never that its about guy much like you or me whos down his luck everyday feels like sunday hes pushing 30 single broke im sad say that at this moment it almost reminds me myself every minute more another reason its hard pick my favorite scenes movie i love chemistry between rocky adrian shire when hes talking door she finally comes out then stops look mirror its thing beauty or when mickey meredith goes over stallones apartment rocky gets upset punches his shitty wall then goes hide bathroom look stallones face when he comes out find mickey still there is priceless i heard it wasnt script or directed just happened but one that does it me is when he comes home opening scene after chapel fight he turns his record player goes beer but its empty like everything else his life talks turtles his fish why because rock is lonely goes mirror practices joke his love looks at picture himself realizes hes wasting his life its more than beautiful or real its safe say that i have seen original more than 100 times i still feel all emotion i love this movie more than any other film i hope one day with gods help show it my kids have them feel same way i think if i ever got chance meet stallone id want thank him tell him how he changed my life but reality he probably wouldnt care because im at least half bum,0.5672364672364671,0.16240333740333737,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,"""He doesn't know it's a show. He thinks it's a damn fight!""","One gains a certain degree of perspective with the passage of time, and one of the things I like to do is watch a movie that I saw upon it's original release and compare my feelings for it now to those I experienced back in the day. I thought ""Rocky"" was a great and inspiring movie back in 1976, and with only the slightest bit of hesitation, I think it delivers the same feelings today. I throw in that slight hesitation part because over the years, the sports underdog theme has been worked to death in cinema. But the thing about ""Rocky"" is that it's not so much a film about boxing as it is a film about life in general. A direction-less man with no goals suddenly finds the gold ring handed to him on a platter. Not that there isn't a whole lot of work involved to make that dream come true, but one has to recognize opportunity in the first place. I read with some amusement the negative reviews of the picture on this board and have to wonder how many of the nay-sayers consider themselves so intellectually superior that they trash the film for that simple lack of recognition. Because criticizing Rocky Balboa for talking like he had a mouth full of marbles is missing the point. He talked like that because he was a street punk working as an enforcer for a local mob boss, and the people he dealt with on a daily basis weren't exactly magna cum laude types. Nor was he going up against members of mensa whenever he climbed through the ring ropes at a local boxing joint.To prove he's not just another bum from the neighborhood, all Rocky wants to do, as he confesses to Adrian (Talia Shire) in that touching apartment scene, is go the distance with the champ. He doesn't have to knock him out, doesn't even have to win, just go the distance. You know, I still have to remind myself at times as I reflect on the picture that Rocky really didn't win the match. But he comes out a winner in the truest sense of the word, and that message blurs out the ring announcer's call of a split decision in favor of Apollo Creed. If there was no ""Rocky II"", (or III or IV or V), I wonder how many of the movie's fans would have been settled with the idea that Rocky Balboa actually became the world champion that day.",he doesnt know its show he thinks its damn fight,one gains certain degree perspective with passage time one things i like do is watch movie that i saw upon its original release compare my feelings it now those i experienced back day i thought rocky was great inspiring movie back 1976 with only slightest bit hesitation i think it delivers same feelings today i throw that slight hesitation part because over years sports underdog theme has been worked death cinema but thing about rocky is that its not so much film about boxing as it is film about life general direction less man with no goals suddenly finds gold ring handed him platter not that there isnt whole lot work involved make that dream come true but one has recognize opportunity first place i read with some amusement negative reviews picture this board have wonder how many nay sayers consider themselves so intellectually superior that they trash film that simple lack recognition because criticizing rocky balboa talking like he had mouth full marbles is missing point he talked like that because he was street punk working as enforcer local mob boss people he dealt with daily basis werent exactly magna cum laude types nor was he going up against members mensa whenever he climbed through ring ropes at local boxing joint prove hes not just another bum neighborhood all rocky wants do as he confesses adrian talia shire that touching apartment scene is go distance with champ he doesnt have knock him out doesnt even have win just go distance you know i still have remind myself at times as i reflect picture that rocky really didnt win match but he comes out winner truest sense word that message blurs out ring announcers call split decision favor apollo creed if there was no rocky ii or iii or iv or v i wonder how many movies fans would have been settled with idea that rocky balboa actually became world champion that day,0.385889355742297,0.22664565826330532,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9,A great Sylvester Stallone film,"If you think Sylvester Stallone has made nothing but stinkers you just have to see 'Rocky'. This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone's own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, 'Raging Bull', and 'Rocky' will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it's quite an achievement.The story is about Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer who once had a glorious future, but now fights for little money in gyms. Then, out of the blue, he gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champ Apollo (Carl Weathers), a stunt from his side. Although Rocky seems to have no chance he starts his training to make the best of it, although at first he is too proud to accept any help. The scene where he finally accepts the help from his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is one of the best scenes in the film. Rocky also starts dating the very shy girl Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of his friend Paulie (Burt Young).'Rocky' is a terrific film in every aspect. The acting is what amazed me the most. Stallone gives such an impressive performance it is very hard to believe he is also the star of films like 'Over the Top', 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' and 'Judge Dredd', and from the other 'Rocky'-films for that matter. Not only Stallone is impressive, Shire, Young and Meredith find perfect notes for their characters as well. Every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting and of course Stallone's screenplay does a great job here. Director John G. Avildsen serves this material the way he should. Of course he is no Martin Scorsese, 'Raging Bull' stays the better directed film, but he knows how to tell this story.I do not like boxing very much, so a boxing-film is not something I would enjoy. But this is not a boxing-film, it is a film about a boxer. It tells about a character who happens to be a boxer running for a title. This is probably one of the points where the other four 'Rocky'-films fail and where films like this one and 'Raging Bull' and Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' succeed.",great sylvester stallone film,if you think sylvester stallone has made nothing but stinkers you just have see rocky this is brilliant film based stallones own screenplay where he plays complex character such terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going be great actor compare it another great film about boxer raging bull rocky will be better at some points it goes without saying that its quite achievement story is about rocky balboa stallone boxer who once had glorious future but now fights little money gyms then out blue he gets chance fight heavyweight champ apollo carl weathers stunt his side although rocky seems have no chance he starts his training make best it although at first he is too proud accept any help scene where he finally accepts help his old trainer mickey burgess meredith is one best scenes film rocky also starts dating very shy girl adrian talia shire sister his friend paulie burt young rocky is terrific film every aspect acting is what amazed me most stallone gives such impressive performance it is very hard believe he is also star films like over top stop or my mom will shoot judge dredd other rocky films that matter not only stallone is impressive shire young meredith find perfect notes their characters as well every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting course stallones screenplay does great job here director john g avildsen serves this material way he should course he is no martin scorsese raging bull stays better directed film but he knows how tell this story i do not like boxing very much so boxing film is not something i would enjoy but this is not boxing film it is film about boxer it tells about character who happens be boxer running title this is probably one points where other four rocky films fail where films like this one raging bull clint eastwoods million dollar baby succeed,0.5541071428571429,0.27097222222222217,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.25}"

10,"""I ain't no bum, Mick. I ain't no bum.""","A first-rate film that's about as close to perfect as any movie about boxing (or any other sport) that I've ever seen. The plot is very simple -- small-time boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is given a chance to fight the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). It sounds no different than a ton of old movies about the sport. But this film proves that it's not always how fresh or unique the story is but how well it's crafted. Rocky is a masterpiece of filmmaking with dynamite acting from Sylvester Stallone, Burgess Meredith, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers. Many classic scenes, lines, characters. Bill Conti's score is one of the all-time greats. It was nominated for nine Oscars, winning three including Best Picture. It was director John G. Avildsen's best film and many would argue it is Stallone's best as well. Certainly his best screenplay. The fight choreography is terrific. Followed by a string of enjoyable sequels but they were just solid entertainment. This one is very entertaining but it is also something much more than that. It's one of those movies that becomes part of culture in a big way where everybody recognizes something from the film even if they've never seen it.",i aint no bum mick i aint no bum,first rate film thats about as close perfect as any movie about boxing or any other sport that ive ever seen plot is very simple small time boxer rocky balboa sylvester stallone is given chance fight heavyweight champion apollo creed carl weathers it sounds no different than ton old movies about sport but this film proves that its not always how fresh or unique story is but how well its crafted rocky is masterpiece filmmaking with dynamite acting sylvester stallone burgess meredith talia shire burt young carl weathers many classic scenes lines characters bill contis score is one all time greats it was nominated nine oscars winning three including best picture it was director john g avildsens best film many would argue it is stallones best as well certainly his best screenplay fight choreography is terrific followed by string enjoyable sequels but they were just solid entertainment this one is very entertaining but it is also something much more than that its one those movies that becomes part culture big way where everybody recognizes something film even if theyve never seen it,0.45076719576719576,0.3548500881834215,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8,Intense Action and Drama,"""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) is a boxer who struggles just trying to make ends meets in the city of Philadelphia. Although he certainly isn't the brightest person around he has a big heart and does the best that he can. Yet even then he realizes that he is going nowhere fast. Then one day he gets a call from a man who wants to schedule a fight between him and the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the World who goes by the name ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers). At first Rocky refuses because he doesn't believe he is in the same class as the World Champion and doesn't deserve the honor. However, he eventually comes around and gets more serious about his training. But even then he has grave doubts about his chances. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very good movie which really highlights the importance of never giving up and always trying to do your best in spite of the odds. Admittedly, the first hour or so is quite slow but during this time it provides the character development necessary for the intense action and drama in the second hour. This is especially true for Talia Shire (as Rocky's girlfriend ""Adrian"") and the aforementioned Sylvester Stallone. At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to those who might be interested in a movie of this type.",intense action drama,rocky balboa sylvester stallone is boxer who struggles just trying make ends meets city philadelphia although he certainly isnt brightest person around he has big heart does best that he can yet even then he realizes that he is going nowhere fast then one day he gets call man who wants schedule fight between him undisputed heavyweight champion world who goes by name apollo creed carl weathers at first rocky refuses because he doesnt believe he is same class as world champion doesnt deserve honor however he eventually comes around gets more serious about his training but even then he has grave doubts about his chances now rather than reveal any more i will just say that this was very good movie which really highlights importance never giving up always trying do your best spite odds admittedly first hour or so is quite slow but during this time it provides character development necessary intense action drama second hour this is especially true talia shire as rockys girlfriend adrian aforementioned sylvester stallone at any rate i thoroughly enjoyed this film recommend it those who might be interested movie this type,0.4483904761904762,0.26563809523809523,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,NOT A BOXING MOVIE!,"The first common misconception about Rocky, and something that's almost inevitable when you put a half-naked Stallone with boxing gloves on the cover is that it's a fighting movie. In that time it would fall into a category including Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jackie Chan. Now don't get me wrong, I like both of these actors a lot, they're among my favorites, but Rocky is not just another cheap movie about a man who like to win a fight or tournament because he deserves it (Bloodsport, Quest). Instead of a fighting movie we should say that it is a movie about a fighter. That changes the context altogether, it means that sure he has fighting on his mind but has other personal issues that are demonstrated throughout the movie. In fact in the whole movie there are two fight scenes (at the beginning and at the end) which together add up to about 15 minutes. The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart. That is to say that he keeps his moral and ethics, just keeps on trying no matter the hardships. A MAN WITH A DREAM... an un-realizable dream to be frank. But in the end, a lot, even most, of our dreams are un-realizable... but we try anyway. The difference here is that this man is given a shot at his dream, a ""one-in-a-million shot"". It's something that we all would like so we can relate and CAN'T HELP but cheer for him at the end of the movie.The largest portion, in minutes, of the movie is actually devoted to the love theme between Rocky and Adrien. So that should maybe make this a ""love story"" movie instead of fighting movie. Adrien is another of his dreams, slightly more attainable which is why he devotes more of his time everyday to trying to attain it (her). She won't open up to anybody but in the end, with a certain amount of tenacity on the part of Stallone, she can't help but fall for the heart deep inside the rough exterior.Another theme here is that of fraternity between Rocky and Mickey, his trainer/manager. In fact THE MOST TOUCHING SCENE in the whole movie in my opinion is one of about 15 to 20 seconds long and without any words. It's when Mickey goes to see Rocky at his home the first time to see if he can manage him. Rocky gets angry with him but keeps it to himself until Mickey leaves, at which point Rocky takes it out on the door jam and yells at Mickey who can still hear him outside. Rocky's life is being turned upside down by this whole ""fighting Creed"" business and although it is his dream, he doesn't know how to deal with it and is scared to get mangled in the ring, knowing he's not of the same caliber as the champ. The touching scene is when he realizes that he has yelled at an old man. His heart takes him out into the street after Mickey, he joins him and shakes his hand. The beginning of an enduring friendship which will ultimately lead to tears in a later film (Rocky 3 and 5).This movie simply seeps with ""classic"", and by the end you know you have just seen a movie of courage, of the portrayal of ""the indominable spirit of man"" (Rocky 3). No matter the difficulties, Rocky's heart takes him through it all. It doesn't fit the mold of today's classics (like Private Ryan) with melodrama and grandiose scenery, just a simple movie, with simple qualities but very large meaning intricately woven into the fabric of the film itself by Stallone and the director John G. Avildson, with the musical overtones of Bill Conti. A classic from a different age, and the mold of a lot of movies to follow.",not boxing movie,first common misconception about rocky something thats almost inevitable when you put half naked stallone with boxing gloves cover is that its fighting movie that time it would fall into category including jean claude van damme jackie chan now dont get me wrong i like both these actors lot theyre among my favorites but rocky is not just another cheap movie about man who like win fight or tournament because he deserves it bloodsport quest instead fighting movie we should say that it is movie about fighter that changes context altogether it means that sure he has fighting his mind but has other personal issues that are demonstrated throughout movie fact whole movie there are two fight scenes at beginning at end which together add up about 15 minutes rest is portrayal man who has never had it easy his life but nonetheless keeps his heart that is say that he keeps his moral ethics just keeps trying no matter hardships man with dream un realizable dream be frank but end lot even most our dreams are un realizable but we try anyway difference here is that this man is given shot at his dream one million shot its something that we all would like so we can relate cant help but cheer him at end movie largest portion minutes movie is actually devoted love theme between rocky adrien so that should maybe make this love story movie instead fighting movie adrien is another his dreams slightly more attainable which is why he devotes more his time everyday trying attain it her she wont open up anybody but end with certain amount tenacity part stallone she cant help but fall heart deep inside rough exterior another theme here is that fraternity between rocky mickey his trainer manager fact most touching scene whole movie my opinion is one about 15 20 seconds long without any words its when mickey goes see rocky at his home first time see if he can manage him rocky gets angry with him but keeps it himself until mickey leaves at which point rocky takes it out door jam yells at mickey who can still hear him outside rockys life is being turned upside down by this whole fighting creed business although it is his dream he doesnt know how deal with it is scared get mangled ring knowing hes not same caliber as champ touching scene is when he realizes that he has yelled at old man his heart takes him out into street after mickey he joins him shakes his hand beginning enduring friendship which will ultimately lead tears later film rocky 3 5 this movie simply seeps with classic by end you know you have just seen movie courage portrayal indominable spirit man rocky 3 no matter difficulties rockys heart takes him through it all it doesnt fit mold todays classics like private ryan with melodrama grandiose scenery just simple movie with simple qualities but very large meaning intricately woven into fabric film itself by stallone director john g avildson with musical overtones bill conti classic different age mold lot movies follow,0.4390555555555556,0.12324603174603174,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.39, 'Fear': 0.35}"

However, ""Rocky"" is a rare film that glamorizes boxing (for the most part) and manages to deliver a film that you can't help but admire. Think about it. It was a small film, costing only about a million, and earned TONS of money and won the Best Picture Oscar!! No matter what you think of the later Rocky Films (as they got progressively worse) or the other films of Sylvester Stallone, you cannot take anything away from this tremendous achievement.

10,Everything About This Film Is Iconic--And Inspirational,"Every once in awhile, a movie comes along that sort of breaks the mold. By almost all accounts, ""Rocky"" never should have even been made, much less developed into a cultural phenomenon. Fortunately, the stars aligned in just the right places to produce what is truly one of the most iconic, inspirational films of all time.For a very basic overview, ""Rocky"" tells the story of titular character Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a Philadelphia ""leg breaker"" who is a street enforcer for loan shark Gazzo (Joe Spinell) and does a little boxing on the side. Rocky eeks out a meager existence and tries to romance shy pet store worker Adrian (Talia Shire) in his spare time. When boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) has a fighter cancel on him, however, the champ gives Rocky (""The Italian Stallion"") a million-to-one shot on American's bi-centennial. With this tremendous opportunity staring him in the face, Rocky falls in with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and resolves to give it his best shot.There is almost no question that ""Rocky"" is one of the most inspirational films ever made. Rocky represents everyone who ""never had a prime"" but is given a shot at one. Does he (and, by extension, we) take it, or let it slip away? That is the crux upon which the entire film is based. Much of this inspiration comes from Stallone, who drew upon many of his own experiences to craft such a true-to-life, yet engaging narrative. It is often tough to tell where ""Rocky ends and Sly begins"", so to speak, as their stories are so intertwined. Art imitating life in the best way imaginable.Every time I watch ""Rocky"", I'm amazed by just how iconic many of its central tenets have become. For example:-Stallone's verbal and visual foibles produced a character that will live on long after I (or my children, or theirs) will. -Shire is the epitome of the unassuming, shy woman who gains her own strength--finally standing up to brother Paulie (Burt Young)--through Rocky but also provides him the same in return. -The archetype of the crusty old boxing trainer? Practically invented by Meredith's ""Mick"". -Bill Conti's simple piano melodies and bombastic brass fanfares compose one of the best original scores ever heard. -Even the location--Philly--seems like a character. Whereas Rocky gained strength from his roots, now that city draws much of its own identity from the character.Upon a recent re-watch, I was also struck by how little boxing actually resides within the film. The big Creed fight only takes about 10-15 minutes of screen time. No, ""Rocky"" is all about the character development and journey. Scenes of him ice skating with Adrian, punching the raw meat, jogging through Philly, or contemplating his big opportunity are what steal the show here.All in all, everything just comes together in ""Rocky"" to create a movie that will last through the ages. Despite being a low-budget project that Stallone had to mortgage his future to get made, then threaten to pull out entirely if not cast in the lead role, the end product was legendary. It spawned five direct sequels and two more spinoff ""Creed"" films, all entertaining in their own rights, but there is simply something special about this 1976 original.",everything about this film is iconic inspirational,every once awhile movie comes along that sort breaks mold by almost all accounts rocky never should have even been made much less developed into cultural phenomenon fortunately stars aligned just right places produce what is truly one most iconic inspirational films all time very basic overview rocky tells story titular character rocky balboa sylvester stallone philadelphia leg breaker who is street enforcer loan shark gazzo joe spinell does little boxing side rocky eeks out meager existence tries romance shy pet store worker adrian talia shire his spare time when boxing champion apollo creed carl weathers has fighter cancel him however champ gives rocky italian stallion million one shot americans bi centennial with this tremendous opportunity staring him face rocky falls with trainer mickey burgess meredith resolves give it his best shot there is almost no question that rocky is one most inspirational films ever made rocky represents everyone who never had prime but is given shot at one does he by extension we take it or let it slip away that is crux upon which entire film is based much this inspiration comes stallone who drew upon many his own experiences craft such true life yet engaging narrative it is often tough tell where rocky ends sly begins so speak as their stories are so intertwined art imitating life best way imaginable every time i watch rocky im amazed by just how iconic many its central tenets have become example stallones verbal visual foibles produced character that will live long after i or my children or theirs will shire is epitome unassuming shy woman who gains her own strength finally standing up brother paulie burt young through rocky but also provides him same return archetype crusty old boxing trainer practically invented by merediths mick bill contis simple piano melodies bombastic brass fanfares compose one best original scores ever heard even location philly seems like character whereas rocky gained strength his roots now that city draws much its own identity character upon recent re watch i was also struck by how little boxing actually resides within film big creed fight only takes about 10 15 minutes screen time no rocky is all about character development journey scenes him ice skating with adrian punching raw meat jogging through philly or contemplating his big opportunity are what steal show here all all everything just comes together rocky create movie that will last through ages despite being low budget project that stallone had mortgage his future get made then threaten pull out entirely if not cast lead role end product was legendary it spawned five direct sequels two more spinoff creed films all entertaining their own rights but there is simply something special about this 1976 original,0.4979111166611166,0.2045640807004443,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,Rocky through the ages,"For this review, I'd like to go through all the Rocky movies (including the most recent Creed) and talk about their good points and their bad points. Rocky - The first one is obviously a classic and the best out of the series and made people like Sylvester Stallone a superstar. It takes a simple but touching story of the underdog boxer and rise to have a chance to be a champion. Rocky II - I felt was kind of the same story and was a little cheesy but it still carried the spirit of the original.Rocky III - Like the second one, was cheesy but it was entertaining. But I like how Rocky was doing more boxing and had more drama and Mr. T was a good villain even though he talked too much. Also it featured a great song, ""Eye of the Tiger"".Rocky IV - Again like the two other sequels, cheesy but still entertaining and it had another great song ""No Easy Way Out"". Rocky V - I know this one disappointed a lot of fans but I thought it was okay but I can understand why people didn't like it but I don't think it deserves to be hated.Rocky Balboa - Was redeeming and I like how it has a lot of references to the first Rocky. Creed - Finally, this one was another great comeback for Stallone as Rocky and gave Michael B. Jordan his big break as well. But you can't beat the original because it's the first and a classic, like I said before. But I'm still looking forward to the sequel to Creed next year.",rocky through ages,this review id like go through all rocky movies including most recent creed talk about their good points their bad points rocky first one is obviously classic best out series made people like sylvester stallone superstar it takes simple but touching story underdog boxer rise have chance be champion rocky ii i felt was kind same story was little cheesy but it still carried spirit original rocky iii like second one was cheesy but it was entertaining but i like how rocky was doing more boxing had more drama mr t was good villain even though he talked too much also it featured great song eye tiger rocky iv again like two other sequels cheesy but still entertaining it had another great song no easy way out rocky v i know this one disappointed lot fans but i thought it was okay but i can understand why people didnt like it but i dont think it deserves be hated rocky balboa was redeeming i like how it has lot references first rocky creed finally this one was another great comeback stallone as rocky gave michael b jordan his big break as well but you cant beat original because its first classic like i said before but im still looking forward sequel creed next year,0.5318070818070817,0.18087606837606837,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.46, 'Fear': 0.11}"
10,His whole life was a million-to-one shot...,"When I was a kid there were only three major things in my life: food, wrestling and `Rocky'. My brother and I followed the numerous Rocky Balboa struggles religiously, and even today, there is no exception. Although the latest efforts of Stallone have been pitiful, the movie that made his career is the 1977 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, `Rocky'. On top of that, `Rocky' also earned two more Academy Awards for Best Film-Editing and Best Director (John G. Avildsen).This movie is unlike any other ever put on film. It's films like this that remind us of the beauty that is going to the cinema, and if only I was around during that year when such films as `Close Encounters of the Third Kind', `Jaws', `Saturday Night Fever' and `Network' were all playing in cinemas. The storyline takes place in Philadelphia, where Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) struggles to make a living as both a small-time boxer, and the brawn of a loan shark. Until one day, a sudden opportunity is handed to Rocky to compete for the World Heavy-Weight Title against the champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), a charismatic and flamboyant fighter labelled as `The King of Sting' and `The Master Of Disaster'. Attracted to Rocky's reputation as ""The Italian Stallion"", a match between Creed and the unknown boxer is set, which is subsequently advertised as a fight where a ""nobody"" can become a ""somebody"". Mickey (Burgess Meredith), is the owner of the gym where Rocky trains and later becomes Rocky's manager. Mickey is passionate about the world of boxing, and believes that Rocky has the potential to go the distance, instead of being `a cheap second rate loan-shark'. However, the central character in Rocky's life is Adrian (Talia Shire), a shy pet-store clerk, who acts awkwardly when Rocky even breathes in her direction. However, these almost completely distant outcasts are strangely drawn to each other. While one `didn't have much of a brain', the other `didn't have much of a body', so they worked on their opposites, only to end up together. The legend of this film when it was first released in the mid-70's was: `His whole life was a-million-to-one shot', but what Stallone did was prove to the world that `Rocky' is one-in-a-million.Seeing `Rocky' is both a cinematic experience and a religious experience. When first released, the film appealed to the widest audience, and all felt the emotion and intense passion which passed from the film, to them. The film's possession of realistic acting, superb dialogue and the most phenomenal music score by Bill Conti to date, indeed transformed the face of cinema. Stallone's wholesome performance of his own screenplay is electrifying as the film celebrates of the underdog battling to beat the odds. Fans of cinema aren't manipulated into thinking that the inevitable will happen as it does in every other tedious hero drama.Over 25 years on, `Rocky' still manages to let the audience's emotions explode; Rocky's blossoming relationship with Adrian, the seedy worlds of Mickey and Adrian's alcoholic brother, Paulie (Burt Young), and the affirmation of Rocky's inability to overcome Creed. And who could forget the excruciatingly compelling Balboa / Creed confrontation? Rocky's determination overturns the boxing fraternity, and supplies cinemaphiles with one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, as a body of spectators both on-screen and off applaud and chant for Rocky in unison. The following four Rocky sequels attempted to deliver the same magic as the original, however failed to convey it's message. `Rocky' illustrates how life itself is stifling and perplexing, but sometimes when you lose your way as well as your original intentions, you may just find something better.Simply put, if anyone has a free Friday / Saturday night, this is the film to go out and borrow from the local video store. It's unbelievable that this film was only voted in at #78 on the AFI Top 100 films of all time, and worse yet, was voted in at the SECOND best sports film of all time (the first went to `Hoosiers', starring Gene Hackman). C'mon people, be you black or white or brown or any other skin colour we have yet to discover, get out there and be inspired by Stallone's masterpiece, `Rocky'.",his whole life was million one shot,when i was kid there were only three major things my life food wrestling rocky my brother i followed numerous rocky balboa struggles religiously even today there is no exception although latest efforts stallone have been pitiful movie that made his career is 1977 academy award winner best picture rocky top that rocky also earned two more academy awards best film editing best director john g avildsen this movie is unlike any other ever put film its films like this that remind us beauty that is going cinema if only i was around during that year when such films as close encounters third kind jaws saturday night fever network were all playing cinemas storyline takes place philadelphia where rocky balboa sylvester stallone struggles make living as both small time boxer brawn loan shark until one day sudden opportunity is handed rocky compete world heavy weight title against champion apollo creed carl weathers charismatic flamboyant fighter labelled as king sting master disaster attracted rockys reputation as italian stallion match between creed unknown boxer is set which is subsequently advertised as fight where nobody can become somebody mickey burgess meredith is owner gym where rocky trains later becomes rockys manager mickey is passionate about world boxing believes that rocky has potential go distance instead being cheap second rate loan shark however central character rockys life is adrian talia shire shy pet store clerk who acts awkwardly when rocky even breathes her direction however these almost completely distant outcasts are strangely drawn each other while one didnt have much brain other didnt have much body so they worked their opposites only end up together legend this film when it was first released mid 70s was his whole life was million one shot but what stallone did was prove world that rocky is one million seeing rocky is both cinematic experience religious experience when first released film appealed widest audience all felt emotion intense passion which passed film them films possession realistic acting superb dialogue most phenomenal music score by bill conti date indeed transformed face cinema stallones wholesome performance his own screenplay is electrifying as film celebrates underdog battling beat odds fans cinema arent manipulated into thinking that inevitable will happen as it does every other tedious hero drama over 25 years rocky still manages let audiences emotions explode rockys blossoming relationship with adrian seedy worlds mickey adrians alcoholic brother paulie burt young affirmation rockys inability overcome creed who could forget excruciatingly compelling balboa creed confrontation rockys determination overturns boxing fraternity supplies cinemaphiles with one greatest moments cinematic history as body spectators both screen off applaud chant rocky unison following four rocky sequels attempted deliver same magic as original however failed convey its message rocky illustrates how life itself is stifling perplexing but sometimes when you lose your way as well as your original intentions you may just find something better simply put if anyone has free friday saturday night this is film go out borrow local video store its unbelievable that this film was only voted at afi top 100 films all time worse yet was voted at second best sports film all time first went hoosiers starring gene hackman cmon people be you black or white or brown or any other skin colour we have yet discover get out there be inspired by stallones masterpiece rocky,0.4880229053646773,0.14148734177215194,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.26}"

10,"The older it gets, the better it is... Wonderful Movie!","It seems that those movie productions that had to fight the big fight with the expectations, somehow, turned out to be timeless, not only for the fans of the genre but for the general audiences as well. That is, undeniably, the case with ROCKY not yet directed by Sylvester Stallone but by late John G Avildsen (who comes back with the direction of ROCKY V in 1990). ROCKY, after all these years and a lot of sequels made after, including the recent CREED films, proves to be one of the very best films about sport, a sportsman and, most importantly, a personality - formerly 'nobody' rising to the top-notch fame and popularity.Not being a particular fan of boxing, I am not trying to review this film as an expert relating to some details about it. Indeed, there have been plenty of such reviews before me who praise the way the fight is being filmed here. When I recently re-watched it with my wife, I rather wanted to see it in a fresh way, without all this background knowledge and unnecessary facts what happened later. Just see Rocky as a young man, seemingly 'nobody' an underdog with no perspectives, who lives in a poor district of Philadelphia, in an almost obscure flat (he says that 'his whole place stinks') and yet, is offered a chance of a lifetime - possibility to fight the big fight with the heavy weight champion, Apollo Creed. ROCKY is unique in that determination and the strength he finds within himself because...Sylvester Stallone portrays a man with whom he somehow identifies (that was also the moment in his career - taking a chance that appears once in a lifetime). He has true, genuine motives. His personal motives are powerfully depicted in several scenes, particularly the unforgettable relation with Mickey (played by legendary Burgess Meredith). In the scene of Mick's first visit to Rocky's stinking place, the young boxer opens up his inner self and amidst the rage of his soul, the pain of his mind, he meets a true friend who does not turn his back to him but helps him out and motivates. Mickey understands because he was a boxer himself, he did have his prime and he knows what it is to 'eat lightin' and crap thunder.' Rocky and Mick's relationship is the essence of a tutor and a student, the essence of a good coach who knows the tough rules that are inspiring, astounding, demanding - yet never imposed. This is the power that Rocky finds in himself thanks to Mick who is there to fan the flame of the desire to face the challenge. And he does that truly effectively proving that he 'ain't no bum.' Sometimes, when you watch their scenes, you just seem to forget it is played. It seems so real. Both actors feel their roles tremendously.Sylvester Stallone, apart from the tough world of boxing, apart from being the ""Italian Stallion"" he called himself, portrays a truly gentle guy. That is, in a way, something we like about Rocky most. It is not a typical 'macho' pretending to have no feelings. But where can you find this truth about the man if not when facing a woman. ROCKY combines this subtlety with timidness in the scenes with Adrian (played by Talia Shire already known at the time for her supporting role in GODFATHER). Thanks to Paulie (Burt Young) who supplies Rocky with the meat for the boxing sack and the woman for loving, they go for the first date. I loved the scene he takes her to the ice rink. Mind you that this scene somehow forgets about the tough world that is in the background and is a true depiction of some genuine, pure male-female fascination. The two alone on the ice rink resemble a couple alone in the world, just for themselves. Each of their movement, each of the word they say to each other (Rocky appears to be far more talkative) is here to stay in your memory. The moment he takes her glasses off and their first kiss (which was, for Stallone pretty challenging because Talia Shire was having a flu when she was playing the scene), her visit to his flat (at first so shy and hesitating, yet she made up her mind and entered the flat giving him the credit...as he later remembers in ROCKY BALBOA), these are the moments that you really feel as a viewer. As a matter of fact, her style, her clothes indicate this inexperience and that aspect of her personality is something that Rocky is taken with. Their love grows in the following parts, indeed, but it is here when their scenes are unforgettable. Two people outside of the world that imposes certain manners and conventions: ""But it's Thanksgiving. Yeah to you, but to me it's Thursday.""Sylvester Stallone, though he is not the director of this film, proves to know the psychological mechanisms that are behind the wings of the boxing rink. Imagine that Apollo Creed (played by Carl Weathers who, recently in an interview, still remembers this role as one of his key roles of the career) the master is to fight with some 'underdog' who trains on meat and dares say: ""I will fight the big fight"" This is the pride of a champion that is put to test, this is the situation when truly much is at stake. It is good to remember one scene here when Creed talks on TV and says to sportsmen seemingly discouraging simple people from sport: ""be a thinker not a stinker."" This fear of losing wide acclaim is even more visible in ROCKY II but here, the idea behind it all is not merely a sort of 'rematch' but a guy - a 'nobody' daring fight with the widely acclaimed master that Apollo is. Very well played by Mr Weathers and their fight at the end of the movie is something that you can watch in slow motion even admiring every camera shot, every emotion evoked, dwelling in the spirit of competition, yes, but foremost courage.It would be unfair to review ROCKY and not to mention a word about the very location of the story, the city of Philadelphia. It is no coincidence that Stallone chose this place as the setting of the story: those streets where he is running, those steps that he climbs while training early in the morning, the very background of rising from the bottom. The train that he hears in his small flat, the singing and street parties that he passes (Frank Stallone among the people), the character of Marie whom Rocky discourages from smoking and the kids that leave school and run with Rocky (yes, that is the second part but Philadelphia plays its role in all parts, in particular ROCKY BALBOA where sentiment is combined with the change and new reality).ROCKY is a lovely film with lovely music. The soundtrack is something that can be listened to for hours all over again being a source of inspiration for training, a source of finding this 'power of spirit' from within yourself, it is relaxing and extremely memorable by itself but also fits best to the scenes. Bill Conti did a terrific job here. The theme song ""Gonna Fly Now"" and ""You Take My Heart Away"" simply have a tremendous impact on the emotions of viewers.ROCKY is a rather simple story about a simple guy who trains in a simple way and falls in love with a simple woman. Yet, perhaps that is why it is so extraordinary that may prove to stand aside the masterpieces of cinema and dare equal them.",older it gets better it is wonderful movie,it seems that those movie productions that had fight big fight with expectations somehow turned out be timeless not only fans genre but general audiences as well that is undeniably case with rocky not yet directed by sylvester stallone but by late john g avildsen who comes back with direction rocky v 1990 rocky after all these years lot sequels made after including recent creed films proves be one very best films about

indeed there have been plenty such reviews before me who praise way fight is being filmed here when i recently re watched it with my wife i rather wanted see it fresh way without all this background knowledge unnecessary facts what happened later just see rocky as young man seemingly nobody underdog with no perspectives who lives poor district philadelphia almost obscure flat he says that his whole place stinks yet is offered chance lifetime possibility fight big fight with heavy weight champion apollo creed rocky is unique that determination strength he finds within himself because sylvester stallone portrays man with whom he somehow identifies that was also moment his career taking chance that appears once lifetime he has true genuine motives his personal motives are powerfully depicted several scenes particularly unforgettable relation with mickey played by legendary burgess meredith scene micks first visit rockys stinking place young boxer opens up his inner self amidst rage his soul pain his mind he meets true friend who does not turn his back him but helps him out motivates mickey understands because he was boxer himself he did have his prime he knows what it is

finds himself thanks mick who is there fan flame desire face challenge he does that truly effectively proving that he aint no bum sometimes when you watch their scenes you just seem forget it is played it seems so real both actors feel their roles tremendously sylvester stallone apart tough world boxing apart being italian stallion he called himself portrays truly gentle guy that is way

I have owned this movie series on Video, DVD, Blu-ray and owned just about every version going.The main story is about one mans struggles to overcome the odds life has stacked against him but it is also a love story. There are real touches of greatness such as Burgess Meredith as Mickey as veteran boxer who does not want to train Rocky as he sees him as a washed out bum until he is offered a shot at the big time. Then seeing his relationship with Rocky grow. The acting is superb and the music still pumps my blood to this day.

8,The Rocky Movie With Character Studies,"After not seeing this film since it had come out in the theaters in 1976, I was almost shocked at how little action this movie had compared to what you see today....or in the Rocky sequels, for that matter. It's okay. It was needed to give us character studies of the main players: Rocky, his wife, his brother, his manager, etc., people we would see in subsequent films. Also, the fight scenes in those sequels went on too long, anyway. Frankly, I've enjoyed all the Rocky movies, beginning with this one.In this film, the romance between ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) and ""Adrian"" (Talia Shire) was a major subplot to the boxing saga. It reminded me a bit of the '50s film with Paul Newman, ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" If you enjoyed this movie, check that classic film out.The DVD transfer is excellent, especially considering the movie is 30 years old.",rocky movie with character studies,after not seeing this film since it had come out theaters 1976 i was almost shocked at how little action this movie had compared what you see today or rocky sequels that matter its okay it was needed give us character studies main players rocky his wife his brother his manager etc people we would see subsequent films also fight scenes those sequels went too long anyway frankly ive enjoyed all rocky movies beginning with this one this film romance between rocky balboa sylvester stallone adrian talia shire was major subplot boxing saga it reminded me bit 50s film with paul newman somebody up there likes me if you enjoyed this movie check that classic film out dvd transfer is excellent especially considering movie is 30 years old,0.49642857142857144,0.1541666666666667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9,Underdog,"The making of the movie, seems to mirror the movie itself. As much as Sylvester Stallone struggled to make the movie, as much is his character Rocky in a struggle in life. And that's what makes the movie so great. The boxing reflects the life of it's characters. And Sly believed in this movie, which is why he wanted to star in it too. His choices were right.Beginning from the script, to the actors he chose, to the music (I'm only going to say stairwell, because who ever saw the movie, can't deny the power of that scene ... and the music that played an integral part for it to work). Everything fits like a glove ... (no) pun intended.And while it seems so simple, it actually isn't. Ask ""Ali"" (the movie) or ""Cinderella Man"". Both with big star players, both ""Box movies"", but both didn't succeed (at least commercially). There aren't many great movies about boxing, but this is definitely one of them (like the entirely different ""Raging Bull"").",underdog,making movie seems mirror movie itself as much as sylvester stallone struggled make movie as much is his character rocky struggle life thats what makes movie so great boxing reflects life its characters sly believed this movie which is why he wanted star it too his choices were right beginning script actors he chose music im only going say stairwell because who ever saw movie cant deny power that scene music that played integral part it work everything fits like glove no pun intended while it seems so simple it actually isnt ask ali movie or cinderella man both with big star players both box movies but both didnt succeed at least commercially there arent many great movies about boxing but this is definitely one them like entirely different raging bull,0.42806122448979583,0.17755102040816326,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"
10,Rocky and Sly is the underdog in a sport boxing cinema masterpiece that started all,"Rocky is a high quality movie it won the best picture at the oscars and it deserve it. It is a sport cinema masterpiece and Sylvester Stallone and Rocky is the underdog of the underdog story's. Sly was always poor and almost homeless in the 70's, he didn't had anything to eat. This is the best sport boxing drama of all time, I have ever seen. I would say ""Rocky"" and ""First Blood"" are the best movies in the franchise that Stallone filmed them. They started all. I am a huge Stallone fan I love him to death and the first original Rocky movie is the best one in the franchise. I love this film to death and it is Sylvester Stallone's best, best, best acting performance of all time.""His whole life was a million to one shot.""Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is a down on his luck Philadephia southpaw fighting at local club. When the world heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) choooses him as an unlikely opponent in his championship bicetennial fight, he's given the chance of a liftime. What wa soriginally planned as a publicitystunt becomes a chance for Rocky to prove himself as a prizefighter. While training with his cantnkerous maneger (Burgess Meredith). He also struggles to win a heart of his best friend's shy sister Adrian (Talia Shire). With the love of Adrian on his side, Rocky tries to overcome the odds, fighting with all his heart in the glorious and brutal finale.Rocky was writen by Sylvester Stallone himself, when he saw the boxing match against Chuck Wepner vs Muhammad Ali who went all 15 rounds to distance and he pretty much had no chance. The inspiration for Rocky was boxer Chuck Wepner and Sly wrote his own story based on that boxer. He knocked on all doors asking studios if they interested in a boxing drama most of the studios rejected Sly. Until United Artists was interested in to making the film with Sly in the lead. Directed was beautiful by John G. Avildsen who directed beautiful this masterpiece sports boxing movie. John G. Avildsen 8 years later directed The Karate Kid (1984) another competition's sports drama movie and actor Rob Garrison who played Tommy from Cobra Kai just died this friday and it is sad. John G. Avildsen also past away two years ago both director and actor from The Karate Kid (1984) rest in peace they are both missed.Butkus Stallone was a real dog in this movie that Sly used to own a dog. In the early 1970's. Sly was poor and almost homeless. He had no money for him and his dog Butkus so he sold his dog for $40 so that he could buy a food. Just like his character Rocky. He does the best he can to get buy. He fights in the boxing club with Spider Rico (Pedro Lovell) wins the fight but get's paid only $40. He is a collector for Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell). That's what Rocky did in this movie for the living to get buy, he was a good heart man. He grab a homeless poor men and he walked him in to the bar. After studio payed Sly for the script for Rocky movie, Sly tracked down the owner of that dog and he bought his Butkus dog back for $15,000. So Butkus the dog was in this movie Stallone's real dog.It is a beautiful story, I love how they shot the mean streets of Philadephia how they showed people at night walking the streets. I love the beautiful shots. How people on the street were that time and not today. I love the training seqquence how Rocky was runing trough a junkyard towards Columbus Blvd) I love the song Gonna Fly Now by Bill Conti. I love the dialouges Mickey: OK, I'm gonna tell ya! You had the talent to become a good fighter, but instead of that, you become a legbreaker to some cheap, second rate loanshark! Rocky: It's a living. Mickey: IT'S A WASTE OF LIFE! The final fight on the finale between Rocky and Apollo was realistic it was real and the fight was for real. in 2014 when I was by my dentist for my tooth problems and I saw all that blood all that hurt I told my dentist this is like Rocky I bloody match and he smiled and he said you said that well see you next round. I love this movie to death, It is a beautiful sports drama.Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Rocky's tranior and menager did a great job he was the second heart of the film. The acting from everyone was realistic. Carl Weathers was great as Apollo Creed, he was excellent. Burt Young as Paulie was still great and funny in this movie. I don't like Creed (2015) spin off movie because it was remake of Rocky this movie and Adonis Creed was just a rich kid who had a daddy isuess and he quit his job to become a boxer for no reason. Rocky is the underdog, he is a poor and good heart. In my opinion Rocky is MILES way better movie than Creed movies nowdays and Raging Bull (1980) I never saw that film and I don't care.Rocky is Sylvester Stallone's best movie her ever did, it is the underdog story in a sport cinema boxing masterpiece.

10,One of the greatest movies of all time.,"I don't remember exactly when I first saw this film, but for a long time I thought that the second of the series was my favorite. Well, I recently bought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knew that it was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best movies ever made. Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie. It's a movie about the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to ""go the distance."" Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and a debt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell). He becomes involved with a shy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomes friends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young). Rocky's life really isn't anything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title. An old boxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky's manager. Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some of the greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time. Rocky striving to go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closing moments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody. Add to this an excellent music score and you have a classic and unforgettable movie. Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in 1976.  Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone. **** out of ****",one greatest movies all time,i dont remember exactly when i first saw this film but long time i thought that second series was my favorite well i recently bought dvd box set after i watched first movie again i knew that it was definitely best series also one best movies ever made rocky is very much more than just boxing movie its movie about unbreakable human spirit determination will go distance rocky sylvester stallone is second rate club fighter debt collector loan shark joe spinnell he becomes involved with shy girl working petshop named adrian talia shire also becomes friends with her brother paulie burt young rockys life really isnt anything interest until world heavyweight champion apollo creed carl weathers gives him unexpected shot at title old boxer turned trainer named mick burgess meredith offers be rockys manager although whole film is outstanding what follows are some greatest most memorable movie moments all time rocky striving go distance training scene final fight closing moments film are so emotional inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate human spirit can bring out will win anybody add this excellent music score you have classic unforgettable movie without doubt deserved best picture award 1976 exceptional performances by all cast members notably burgess meredith sylvester stallone out,0.5266203703703705,0.38703703703703707,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.33}"

9,The Cinderella Film,"Sylvester Stallone had a dream and it was to get this film made about an enduring character he created, one of the most enduring in the history of cinema. In true Cinderella Man style Rocky guaranteed him a career and screen immortality. A whole lot like the protagonist ROcky Balboa in the film.There was an Irish equivalent of Rocky during the early Sixties in real life, a boxer named Tom McNeeley from South Boston, just as Rocky Balboa is from South Philadelphia. McNeeley was a barely ranked contender, ranked in fact at all just to give him some kind of credence as an opponent for Floyd Patterson. McNeeley fought Patterson in Boston for the local gate attraction. Needless to say his showing against Floyd wasn't quite as good as what Rocky did against Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, showboating heavyweight champion in the style of Muhammed Ali.And that's what happens to Rocky. Stallone is a local club fighter who also works as a part time enforcer for the loan sharks, but his heart isn't really into it. His heart is torn actually between boxing and his love for Talia Shire, the plain Jane sister of his friend Burt Young.When opportunity comes you have to take it. For some reason a scheduled match between Weathers and another contender for the championship falls through. Several other name contenders aren't available, so it comes down to Rocky Balboa being given a once in lifetime chance in a bout to be held in his native Philadelphia like McNeeley's was in real life.Rocky was the Cinderella story of the Oscars that year, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for John G. Avildsen, and Best Film Editing. Sly Stallone was nominated for Best Actor and Original Screenplay. He lost however to Peter Finch for Network. Burgess Meredith as Rocky's cornerman and gym owner and Carl Weathers were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but both lost to Jason Robards, Jr. for All the President's Men. My favorite in the film was Talia Shire, she is really touching as the Thirty something unmarried plain girl who grabs a last chance for love with Rocky. The role is so different from Connie Corleone in any of the three Godfather films. Sadly Talia lost to Beatrice Straight as William Holden's wife in Network.John Avildsen winning for Best Director is great though I think the film is so much Stallone's own creation, he should have won for Original Screenplay. Avildsen never directed anything as good as Rocky before or since. In fact he directed seven years later one of my all time favorite trash films, A Night In Heaven.Rocky is the great Cinderella movie of all time, the creation of its leading character who put enough of his heart into this film and gained a career for himself. None of the succeeding Rocky films came anywhere near this one for quality. And the story itself was pure Cinderella. How paradoxical and how great.",cinderella film,sylvester stallone had dream it was get this film made about enduring character he created one most enduring history cinema true cinderella man style rocky guaranteed him career screen immortality whole lot like protagonist rocky balboa film there was irish equivalent rocky during early sixties real life boxer named tom mcneeley south boston just as rocky balboa is south philadelphia mcneeley was barely ranked contender ranked fact at all just give him some kind credence as opponent floyd patterson mcneeley fought patterson boston local gate attraction needless say his showing against floyd wasnt quite as good as what rocky did against carl weathers as apollo creed showboating heavyweight champion style muhammed ali thats what happens rocky stallone is local club fighter who also works as part time enforcer loan sharks but his heart isnt really into it his heart is torn actually between boxing his love talia shire plain jane sister his friend burt young when opportunity comes you have take it some reason scheduled match between weathers another contender championship falls through several other name contenders arent available so it comes down rocky balboa being given once lifetime chance bout be held his native philadelphia like mcneeleys was real life rocky was cinderella story oscars that year it won best picture best director john g avildsen best film editing sly stallone was nominated best actor original screenplay he lost however peter finch network burgess meredith as rockys cornerman gym owner carl weathers were nominated best supporting actor but both lost jason robards jr all presidents men my favorite film was talia shire she is really touching as thirty something unmarried plain girl who grabs last chance love with rocky role is so different connie corleone any three godfather films sadly talia lost beatrice straight as william holdens wife network john avildsen winning best director is great though i think film is so much stallones own creation he should have won original screenplay avildsen never directed anything as good as rocky before or since fact he directed seven years later one my all time favorite trash films night heaven rocky is great cinderella movie all time creation its leading character who put enough his heart into this film gained career himself none succeeding rocky films came anywhere near this one quality story itself was pure cinderella how paradoxical how great,0.45185963274198576,0.3197089947089947,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.2}"

10,What's Not to Like,"Rocky is the consummate boxing movie. But it's also the story of a man who had pretty much wasted his life. Sylvester Stallone's boxer has thick head and a good heart. He depends on other to kind of look out for him. Unfortunately, he has worked with crooks because it's the only living he knows. He does hard manual labor. He likes to box and because he is intense, he catches the eye of the world champion. He gets a gig as a sparring partner and eventually a fight with the champ, Apollo Creed. Of course, it's a circus. Because Rocky is not bright, Creed is able to abuse him emotionally. Rocky is a bruiser, taking as many hits as he gives. Not a good way to have a future. There are subplots, involving MIck (Burgess Meredith) and Pauley (who is disrespectful of his sister Adrian) and then there is the romance developing between Rocky and Adrian. What happens is that Creed thinks Rocky is a joke while Rocky begins to train seriously for the first time in his life. What eventually happens is one of the best choreographed fights in all of cinematic history. A masterful movie.",whats not like,rocky is consummate boxing movie but its also story man who had pretty much wasted his life sylvester stallones boxer has thick head good heart he depends other kind look out him unfortunately he has worked with crooks because its only living he knows he does hard manual labor he likes box because he is intense he catches eye world champion he gets gig as sparring partner eventually fight with champ apollo creed course its circus because rocky is not bright creed is able abuse him emotionally rocky is bruiser taking as many hits as he gives not good way have future there are subplots involving mick burgess meredith pauley who is disrespectful his sister adrian then there is romance developing between rocky adrian what happens is that creed thinks rocky is joke while rocky begins train seriously first time his life what eventually happens is one best choreographed fights all cinematic history masterful movie,0.6202380952380954,0.18253968253968253,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.31}"
