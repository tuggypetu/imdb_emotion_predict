,Technically impressive with great script and sharp wit,"Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there. One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll. When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house. But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out. I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula. It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background. However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it. The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up. The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more. Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast. They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines. Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog. They are funny and are very well used. In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film. It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands. However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly. The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more). A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by. The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!",technically impressive with great script sharp wit,andys toys live reasonable life fun peace their only worries are birthdays christmases when new toys could easily replace those already there one such birthday andys top toy woody cowboy finds himself direct competition with andys new buzz lightyear doll when rivalries boil over woody tries hide buzz down side bed but accidentally pushes him out window other tops expel woody he leaves with no choice but find buzz return him house but with only two days before andy moves house time is essence given how often same mix animation wit jokes kids humour has been used since toy story ice age monsters inc bugs life it is easy forget how refreshing it was when it first came out i have just watched it again it is dating little comparison more recent twists formula it seems each one has be sharper have more references etc background however it is still very funny deserves praise being first successful formula plot is simple but effective actually has genuine drama excitement it main story is fun but degree character development is what really shores it up conflict between buzz woody is taken deeper than this when confronted by truth his status as toy buzzs turmoil is very real as opposed him being cartoon character nothing more despite two strong leads there is real depth support cast they may not actually have that many lines but they have all funniest lines most adult wit comes potato head dinosaur pig slinky dog they are funny are very well used fact majority this humour plot will go right over kids heads looking back it i do feel cynical edge it so much as this film must really have helped sales toy companies film its hard not see marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands however actual product is so wonderfully fun that i forgot this quickly voice work is excellent characters match actors hanks is good as woody allen has good b movie type voice buzz varney ratzenberger ermey doing his usual rickles others are all really good support roles probably come out as favourite characters adults overall this is classic film that will appeal adults as much as kids if not more good plot really sharp script make already short running time fly by only downside is that your kids will want you go out buy damn things,0.5056401489010186,0.2251702846268063,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"Excellent Viewing, Every Time!","This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as ""Woody"" and Allen as ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too.

9.0,"Created a decade ago, but still stunning","I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.",created decade ago but still stunning,i am big fan animated movies coming pixar studios they are always looking newest technological possibilities use their movies creating movies that are more than just worth watch even when they were made decade ago movie is about toys that come life when their owner is asleep or not same room when young boys birthday is coming up all toys are nervous they dont want be ignored when new one arrives woody cowboy is their leader because hes most popular one them all hes only one that hasnt got be afraid but than new favorite arrives buzz lightyear he hates him tries everything possible get rid him but as time passes by they learn appreciate each other when you see toy story you may think that different human like characters woody cowboy instance arent always as perfect as we are used see todays animated movies perhaps thats true but if you keep mind that all this was done 1995 when computers werent yet as strong technology creating such movies was almost unknown than you can only have lot respect what creators did i loved story liked animations lot i give it 8 5 10,0.6150932400932402,0.2088869463869464,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"""I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films.""","Toy Story – 5/5 starsChildren play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.''Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway.",i can safely say that i have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over years as i have enjoyed pixar films,toy story 5 5 starschildren play with toys it is known fact at one time or another we all played with toys whether they were action figures dolls little green soldiers etc but what if toys were real what if they could talk pixar disney serve us this theory what was first full length computer animated film ever toy story chronicling events life cowboy doll woody voiced by tom hanks woody is favorite toy his owner small child named andy andy brings woody everywhere cherishes him as we see beginning film however this all changes andys birthday when andy gets new toy buzz lightyear doll voiced by tim allen woody is suddenly forgotten left with rest his friends mr potato head don rickles rex wallace shawn slinky dog jim varney better known as ernest ham see if you can guess voice this one ill give you hint cheers but after buzz accidentally gets knocked out upstairs window woody is prime suspect now after woody buzz end up next door toy killer sids house woody must prove his innocence by getting both buzz him back andys house safely toy story builds element we all shrug off carelessly thoughtlessly much like they did last year with monsters under bed pixar took theory live toys new level toy story filling our minds with endless possibilities what pixar does is strange thing it doesnt just try expand our mind but also out world i respect enjoy that monsters inc pixar managed preach us what if monsters under bed are real what if they have world much like ours have feelings like humans while never forgetting equally important formula humor much is same with their earlier film toy story what if those wooden plastic toys we all played with as kids are real what if they have feelings emotions voices human qualities interesting idea by itself but when mixed with wicked sense humor reality youve got yourself one best films ever tom hanks is perfect as woody pixar must have modeled dolls expressions movements after hanks because after while i feel like i am watching hanks screen not computer generated image when you get point not being able tell animation reality you know that voices are good same goes tim allen though body gestures were most likely not modeled after allens physical expressions buzz is short pot bellied toy rest cast is excellent all very believable entertaining you begin love each character their distinguishing traits that is always refreshing i can safely say that i have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over years as i have enjoyed pixar films only film they made that i named forgettable was bugs life which was it not horrible but lacking sense humor other pixar films have had pixar makes very refreshing films era cheap made video disney sequels rip off cartoons television babysitters i e jungle book 2 pixar holds true values that made disney films so entertaining back 30s 60s respect audiences intelligence humor provocative ideas base film upon respect audience not exact same thing as first element all which are forgotten this day age money makers i respect pixar very much after hearing how little disney does helping with their films i feel that disney is just trying cash their ideas by having their name branded posters pixar films shame you disney proof that disney has no respect audiences is fact that they will not let another sequel be made something that fans like me would rather have than something like finding nemo toy story 1 2 are both my favorite films list it may sound stupid but if i made up top 250 list like imdb com both those films would be there so would monsters inc after unpromising trailer pixars upcoming film finding nemo i think that after their licensing deal with disney is disputed they have cough up five more original films not sequels by 2005 they should definitely try make toy story 3 ill be first line it anyway,0.5044201839826841,0.17805113636363634,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,As Good as It Gets!,"What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the ""humanity"" of the characters.

,Falling With Style,"""I believe that a filmmaker's entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified."" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the ""real world of toys"".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the ""chosen ones"", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. ""Nirvana is coming!"" the aliens whisper, watching as the ""chosen ones"" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is ""just an ordinary toy"" who ""can not fly"". ""Flying"" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the ""flesh"" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become ""something more"".Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. ""I am not a toy!"" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What's the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise? It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (""Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?"").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not ""up in the skies"". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the ""greater good of his family"" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the ""moral code"" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: ""To Infinity and Beyond!"" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, ""Toy Story"" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since ""Snow White"".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, ""The Incredibles"". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance.

9.0,Plastic Fantastic.,"Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking! In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels  in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature  just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz  who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.",plastic fantastic,yknow i always suspected that my toys were coming life when i wasnt looking andys room his toys lead lives noisy desperation come every birthday christmas no one wants be one upped by new addition toy box nominally led by cowboy woody theres brokeback joke there just waiting happen mr potato head rex dinosaur ham piggybank bo peep slinky dog smattering other playthings go about their toy business playing checkers hanging with hometoys plastic corrosion awareness meetings until andys birthday party when they gather expectantly around transistor radio listening reports their toy soldier troops field downstairs watching andys gift opening hoping that no gift will be exciting enough cause andy neglect them there is his name is buzz lightyear space ranger directed by pixar mainstay john lasseter with voice talents tom hanks as woody don rickles john ratzenberger forever cliff cheers r lee ermey annie potts jim varney tim allen as buzz toy story is that rara avis that succeeds all levels its animation storyline character development its messages friendship self realization most importantly its entertainment value fact that this is cartoon or animated feature just what do we call this new wave computer generated movies is incidental which makes slightly dodgy animation real people irrelevant it gets point across with or without technological finesse disney movie has become synonymous with maudlin messages redneck fundamentalism anachronistic family values boneheaded parents smart mouthing youngsters too hip be smart teens insufferable pets though disneys tyrannical umbrella overarches this films production studio pixar animation toy story somehow avoided all trace disneys craven hand which is doubly surprising considering this is pixars first feature length film after years experimentation right outa gate right outa field sure there are messages but they are heartfelt rather than maudlin woody tells buzz during buzzs greatest depression that it matters not what buzz thinks himself what makes him important is what his owner andy thinks him there are emotional segments which are truly heartbreaking rather than cheesy when buzzs escape attempt lands him with broken arm proving he is not flying toy lyric clearly i will go sailing no more launches thousand hankies portrayal andys family was pixars triumphal achievement boldly contravening disneys id e fixe 1950s nuclear family norman rockwell fantasies one many incarnations modern day family is presented single mother with two kids who are neither geniuses nor monsters just normal children happy visit pizza planet disappointed when favorite toys are lost buzz who believes he is real life space ranger mission save universe become andys favorite toy over woody funny thing is though buzz believes he is real he still adheres toy protocol playing inert when humans are area maybe its instinct when he mentions saving toy sid vicious boy next door how does he propose do it if he is adhere inert protocol buzzs ingenuousness regarding his role as toy infuriates woody point attempted toy assassination through concatenation accidents both he buzz become lost must use teamwork trust ingenuity beat their path back andy which finds them ensconced scorchingly funny vignettes buzz fastening himself over sized seatbelt both falling with green three eyed aliens buzz hyperventilating as mrs nesbitt during climactic rocket ride callback line this is not flying this is falling with style simply seals this movies greatness at least i now have plausible explanation as why my toys always got lost after going about their toy business they would just go inert anywhere they happened be instead paying attention their masters infallible toy filing system,0.5826847189092088,0.14883602791766057,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
10.0,Best Disney film. Ever.,"Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs  note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp. Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.",best disney film ever,toy story is not only best disney film because it has best story best animation but also because excellent actors chosen provide voices animals casting was perfect top bottom movie provides excellent adventure story about friendship loyalty that keeps you engrossed until nail biting climax tom hanks tim allen provided excellent voices woody buzz lightyear their performances alone are one biggest things that made this such spectacular movie besides that though you have excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told this perspective before but also because it was just told so well all characters film are very well developed all have appropriate effective actors chosen provide their voices course who could forget revolutionary animation computer animation used this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons possibilities thankfully filmmakers chose explore these possibilities there are dozens things that are hidden woodwork throughout film as well as songs note example subtle playing indiana jones theme song scene where woody knocks buzz out window with desk lamp toy story is by far best disney film ever made its pretty much perfect its adventurous its exciting its entertaining its good whole family its got great characters story plot above all its fun,0.631904761904762,0.47761904761904755,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10.0,The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.,"With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. ""Toy Story"" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence.How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history.I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think ""Toy Story"". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then.Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, ""Toy Story"" is that proof. 10/10.",largest part my childhood put screen,with wonderful collaboration pixar disney who as 2013 have given us some most visually impressive wonderful movies ever made toy story was go film many childhoods including my own brought cgi movies into mainstream with stunning promises confidence how things came be lucasfilm sold portion their effects company computer giant apple that inevitably became pixar who would go strike deal with disney director john lasseter had lost his job disney pitching idea this story after successful development stage he managed gain back confidence disney alas rest is history i bring this story up just reflect how far weve matured terms story telling technology idea adults giving kids morals entertainment through animation wonderfully echoes that what walt disney set out do so many decades ago toy story has aged extraordinarily well first cgi film ever made held together mostly its impeccable casting i feel ashamed now 20 years old much more experienced movies say i still look at tom hanks tim allen almost immediately think toy story as well as stellar supporting cast its visuals are fantastic music is timeless writers include young joss whedon with rotten antagonist by name sid makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then final verdict its hard find any flaw with such beloved movie especially one now most adults will first show their kids it has everything move touch you deeply believe bunch 0s 1s flying around digital space can do that toy story is that proof 10 10,0.6704954954954954,0.347072072072072,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,my Personal Favorite of Pixar's Work,"I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters.With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD.",my personal favorite pixars work,i remember seeing this film at ripe age seven i was totally entranced by it what kid would not have been attracted that sweet premise released way back 1999 it was totally different usual hand drawn animation yet still as vibrant if not more so even now as 18 year old dude i find it so amazing attention detail has always been lasseters strong suit among many i might add but greatest thing about this film was life evoked into its unique untouchable characters with voice talents tim allen tom hanks as well as hilarious don rickles late jim varney voice acting was perfect dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout what could be perceived more or less as simple story is told with heart humor one that hasnt aged bit since that first viewing i still own my original vhs copy fact but perhaps its time i buy it blu ray or dvd,0.5786596119929454,0.25864197530864197,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
8.0,The World Of Andy's Room,"Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.""Toy Story"" is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when ""Toy Story"" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that ""Kelly's Heroes"" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines (""I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school""), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated ""Galaxy Quest.""While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. ""A Bug's Life"" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, ""Toy Story"" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of ""the claw."" If it reached for pathos a little less often, ""Toy Story"" would be an undeniable classic.As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones.",world andys room,just case you were also wondering what happened all toys that went missing when you were kid answer is clear they escaped toy story is kind childrens movie adults can enjoy just as much because it very cleverly mines deep deposits nostalgia memory banks that may be reason 1990s bedroom young andy is populated by playthings 1960s 1970s 1980s if andy was real boy his time there would be computer tv nintendo not much else voicings various toys add enjoyability tom hanks was biggest star moment when toy story came out he works with that likeability by creating stable center as woody cowboy doll don rickles has screen role his career not that kellys heroes was oscar material as prickly mr potato head while jim varney r lee ermey are standouts supporting cast tim allen gives movies best performance as newfangled toy that takes woodys place andys heart but cant bring himself accept that hes just plastic plaything its role story that gives him best lines i dont believe that man has ever been medical school but allen delivers them with real panache he more than holds his own you kind see where he took off with that note perfect william shatner parody he perfected screen underrated galaxy quest while this movies use computer animation makes it milestone it neither represents most innovative use technology or cleverest pixar ated treatment story bugs life seems more worthy apex that story was funnier worked better its own merits used animation better effect but given how novel all this was 1995 toy story could have been lot less thought through than it was still made gobs money fact it is instead invested with real heart can be watched enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago is tribute people behind it i like randy newmans music just not here while animation textures are surprisingly lifelike there are places especially with scud dog but also with babys drool where it falls short story itself gets kind rote with repeat viewings though transition sids bedroom its sad mutilated toys is genius moment so too are vending machine aliens who gape rapt wonder at judgment claw if it reached pathos little less often toy story would be undeniable classic as it is it is very very good kind film thats only good children even especially inner ones,0.5453191489361702,0.2784929078014184,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10.0,"""Toy Story"" - The Toys are in town and something more","I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that ""Toy Story"" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of ""Toy Story's"" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new ""it"" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit ""Finding Nemo"" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, ""Toy Story"" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love ""Toy Story,"" and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too.10/10",toy story toys are town something more,im 19 going 20 six days i dont need tell you that toy story is movie tailor made kiddies but theres special reservation adults too i should know as should anyone who views it with open mind weve all had our favorite toys guys like me theres 90 chance you played with either transformers or g i joe or teenage mutant ninja turtles or all three when you were six seven eight or nine years old me it was teenage mutant ninja turtles godzilla action figures id always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures my room or basement ah joy being kid again but thats part toy storys fun appeal it gives you chance relive your childhood again today i saw first time about eight years its still just as fresh inventive as pixar probably best film studio computer animation conceived it back 1995 room young andy toys are alive when hes not present course cowboy woody voiced by tom hanks is boys favorite item but all that changes andys birthday new toy given him that day captures boys heart buzz lightyear voiced by tim allen course any replacement this sort inspires jealousy pretty soon buzz is new it item bedroom andys given into everything buzz lightyear even new bedsheets bedsheets leaving poor woody short end stick but thing is buzz has trouble believing hes just simple toy nothing more as he thinks hes actually buzz lightyear it also seems this couldnt have come at worse time toys as andy his mother are moving away which is causing all sorts chaos as woody tries get everything organized so nobody is left behind thats exactly what happens with rivals woody buzz who are misplaced must find their beloved andy before they move not only that they must also battle sid serial killer training kid that lives next door tortures toys as directed by john lasseter his army screenwriters including himself andrew stanton who would co direct pixars future hit finding nemo 2003 joel cohen toy story is true imaginative fantasy realized superb animation it more than brings kid you surface it makes you want be kid again as many toys have cameos including army men including sergeant whos voiced by r lee ermey mr potato head voiced by don rickles i love toy story i think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too 10 10,0.4438885943987984,0.21155579114762782,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"

What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one.

8.0,Infinity and beyond from Disney and Pixar!,"Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid.This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song ""You've Got a Friend in Me."" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie.But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination.

10.0,Best Pixar movie to date!,"Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (""I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout""). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor.

10.0,Pixar's first feature.,"The first feature length Pixar film and the first feature film to be made entirely in computer animated imagery Toy Story was a milestone in film history. But apart from it's massive impact, Toy Story is still a really great film. The toys in the bedroom of Andy Davis (John Morris) are alive (when Andy doesn't look) and seem to have their own community set up. The most popular toy being Andy's favorite toy, a toy cowboy named Woody (Tom Hanks). But that might change this birthday when Andy get's a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a toy spaceman who still thinks that he's a real spaceman. To add on to that Woody takes an immediate disliking to Buzz because Andy seems to play with him more now and all the other toys go the same route. Well Woody and Buzz inadvertently end up in the house of Sid Phillips (Erik Von Detten) the destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much the type of person that would put a turtle on it's shell for fun. So Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and get back to Andy's house before he moves. This film's story is great and intriguing. The comedy here is also great. The dialog between Woody and Buzz is very funny. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's the birthplace of Pixar who over the years have proved themselves worthy of the praise given by adults and children alike.",pixars first feature,first feature length pixar film first feature film be made entirely computer animated imagery toy story was milestone film history but apart its massive impact toy story is still really great film toys bedroom andy davis john morris are alive when andy doesnt look seem have their own community set up most popular toy being andys favorite toy toy cowboy named woody tom hanks but that might change this birthday when andy gets new toy named buzz lightyear tim allen toy spaceman who still thinks that hes real spaceman add that woody takes immediate disliking buzz because andy seems play with him more now all other toys go same route well woody buzz inadvertently end up house sid phillips erik von detten destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much type person that would put turtle its shell fun so woody buzz have overcome their differences get back andys house before he moves this films story is great intriguing comedy here is also great dialog between woody buzz is very funny i definitely recommend this movie anyone who hasnt seen it its birthplace pixar who over years have proved themselves worthy praise given by adults children alike,0.5474837662337662,0.2596320346320346,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.28}"
9.0,Even after 25 years this is still a magical film,"I re-watched this for the first time in about 15 years and it still holds up remarkably well. The animation is still very expressive at capturing character, tone and making a believable world unto itself. Pixar would go on to create more polished films but this one has all the hallmarks of the company. The story is enjoyable for children and if parents squint they can see a metaphor in employment turnover. (Not to mention the cultural transition from westerns to sci-fi, or the meta irony of 2d cell animation being supplanted by CGI). The film is equal parts charming, funny and exciting. It even tugs at the heartstrings not matter how cynical you are. It is far from Pixar's best but it holds its own in the pantheon of animated films.",even after 25 years this is still magical film,i re watched this first time about 15 years it still holds up remarkably well animation is still very expressive at capturing character tone making believable world unto itself pixar would go create more polished films but this one has all hallmarks company story is enjoyable children if parents squint they can see metaphor employment turnover not mention cultural transition westerns sci fi or meta irony 2d cell animation being supplanted by cgi film is equal parts charming funny exciting it even tugs at heartstrings not matter how cynical you are it is far pixars best but it holds its own pantheon animated films,0.6958333333333333,0.40312499999999996,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,Toy Story,"A wonderfully sculpted piece of filmmaking. It brings us into a new age and may this new age have films that are just as delightfully witty as this pleasing film for all ages. The laughs are constant, there's great creativity at work, from the artists and the numerous talents who lend their voices. Hanks, Allen, Rickles and Ermey stand out in their performances.",toy story,wonderfully sculpted piece filmmaking it brings us into new age may this new age have films that are just as delightfully witty as this pleasing film all ages laughs are constant theres great creativity at work artists numerous talents who lend their voices hanks allen rickles ermey stand out their performances,0.6417748917748918,0.3675324675324675,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.23, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"
