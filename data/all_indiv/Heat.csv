9.0,Exceptionally well done though it's not the sort of film for everyone...but what movie is?,"I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like ""Heat"". However, on a lark and because it's apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.The biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It's almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro's oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.There's very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino's character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it's just me....Overall, if you don't mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing. Extremely well-directed and never dull.",exceptionally well done though its not sort film everyone but what movie is,i have very little interest most action films or violent movies so i am not sort person that would normally watch film like heat however lark because its apparently such good film i decided give film look well i must say that thought i was not love with film it sure was exceptionally well made had lot offer even folks like me biggest reason i liked movie thought it was made so well was its rich complex plot at nearly three hours there is lots lots time plot slowly unfold it also allowed several concurrent plots interweave themselves through film story about master criminals cops another criminal as well as rogue nut job that just likes kill its almost like mini series this respect i also loved how this was not set bound film but was made throughout la though i wonder how this was possible as it must have tied up huge portions los angeles i also loved some characters particularly robert de niros oddly professional scary criminal boss it was one his very best performances theres very little complain about film though i thought al pacinos character was tad over acted at times unlike de niro i had harder time believing pacino was real perhaps its just me overall if you dont mind violence occasionally frenetic pace then this is film well wroth seeing extremely well directed never dull,0.5658006535947714,0.1208333333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,One Of The Best Crime Films Ever,"I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn't disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I've heard it. It was such a ""landmark"" scene that It's even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.As with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn't just Pacino and De Niro. It's Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on. Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn't overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can't have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that's nitpicking considering the film as a whole.This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing.",one best crime films ever,i really believe this is one great crime movies all time it has some drawbacks that wouldnt make me recommend this family viewing tons f words by al pacino few bloody scenes but as far as fascinating crime story wow this movie made modern day history because it was first time two great actors this generation pacino robert de niro finally acted together same film those two didnt disappoint either they were great watch one huge highlights film me was when they faced each other simple conversation over cup coffee that conversation has always fascinated me no matter how many times ive heard it it was such landmark scene that its even subject short documentary special edition dvd as with conversation scene shootout segment streets los angeles still astounds me no matter how many times i see it other action scenes are intense memorable too cast here is deep this isnt just pacino de niro its val kilmer ashley judd jon voight diana venora natlie portman tom sizemore amy brenamann wes studi ted levine mykelti williamson put that fabulous cast under michael mann one best directors business add great soundtrack interesting camera work you have great film at three hours long it never bores one at same time doesnt overdo action either i read one critic criticize this film because time taken examine personal lives main characters but you cant have three hours nothing but action only scene i felt went bit too long was ending chase at airport but thats nitpicking considering film as whole this is just one those movies where great cast director live up their billing,0.5173015873015873,0.24430014430014427,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,"Action masterpiece Michael Mann, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's best favorite heist movie of all time","A masterpiece and one of the best action heist movies of all time! Heat (1995) is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting, story, score everything in here is excellent!This movie has a great plot, brilliant story about two lead characters a professional master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) battling Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective in this non-stop race against time heist. Michael Mann did everything with this film, he wrote the screenplay, produced this movie and directed it. Michael Mann is a brilliant director I love Miami Vice TV Series, Manhunter and Collateral.This movie is the real heist movie un like Point Break and Baby Driver this movie deserves a 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors and great stunts. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.Al Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna, a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro).Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements, as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling, the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the ""High Incident Bandits"" robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout (as depicted in the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout).Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective was a great character cop. He was at least MILES way better than Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) FBI rookie Agent in Point Break that movie sucked! Lt. Vincent Hanna shoot and killed Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and he saved a child. He cracked the case and he figure it out who the mask robbers were. In the climatic epic battle fight on the end of the film on the airport field he shoot and killed Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). He destroyed and hunt down McCauley's crew. True two got away but he always got his man. He at least didn't let go McCauley like Johnny Utah did, letting go Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and he did not arrest or shoot or kill any of Bodhi's men he let them all go. Lt. Vincent Hanna is a hero and veteran police officer to me.Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), as a professional thief was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. He at least wasn't like stupid dumb idiot Bodhi from Point Break, he was trying to get away but he always settle a score with everyone that double crossed him. It is wrong to messing with him. By the end that way leaded him to his end, he made a mistake when he went after Waingro (Kevin Gage).The movie has also one of the greatest shootouts in L.A. in which Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) McCauley (Robert De Niro) firing Colt Model 733 automatic riffle on the cops. Great shootout's I love it.The movie has great famous cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Hank Azaria, Martin Ferrero and Xander Berkeley a lot of famous actors and actresses were extra in this movie.The movie focus on a real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal life's like you and me. That is why I love this film to death! It is realistic performed and it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life. I love Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters.Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass.",action masterpiece michael mann al pacino robert de niros best favorite heist movie all time,masterpiece one best action heist movies all time heat 1995 is one my personal favorite al pacino robert de niro action heist movie all time i love this movie death this movie has everything action drama heist great cast incredible realistic great performance al pacino robert de niro provides fast loose action with interesting characters great action movie one best me this day this movie stands classic action heist movie all time acting story score everything here is excellent this movie has great plot brilliant story about two lead characters professional master thief neil mccauley robert de niro battling lt vincent hanna al pacino lapd robbery homicide detective this non stop race against time heist michael mann did everything with this film he wrote screenplay produced this movie directed it michael mann is brilliant director i love miami vice tv series manhunter collateral this movie is real heist movie un like point break baby driver this movie deserves 10 because it takes vision one most imaginative directors earth realizes them almost perfectly with all tools that fit task actors great stunts without vision this film would be nothing without tools this film would be nothing al pacino stars film as vincent hanna relentless lieutenant lapds robbery homicide division who is determined take down high end robbery crew led by master thief neil mccauley de niro notable its detailed depiction techniques used by both law enforcement criminal elements as well as exceptional accurate gun handling film was first made as 1989 television movie l takedown heat also was reported have been viewed repeatedly by high incident bandits robbery duo involved infamous north hollywood shootout as depicted film 44 minutes north hollywood shootout lt vincent hanna al pacino lapd robbery homicide detective was great character cop he was at least miles way better than johnny utah keanu reeves fbi rookie agent point break that movie sucked lt vincent hanna shoot killed michael cheritto tom sizemore he saved child he cracked case he figure it out who mask robbers were climatic epic battle fight end film airport field he shoot killed neil mccauley robert de niro he destroyed hunt down mccauleys crew true two got away but he always got his man he at least didnt let go mccauley like johnny utah did letting go bodhi patrick swayze he did not arrest or shoot or kill any bodhis men he let them all go lt vincent hanna is hero veteran police officer me neil mccauley robert de niro as professional thief was smart intelligent high profile criminal with no criminal record he was mastermind behind robberies he knew what he was doing he was murderer he did what he know best he at least wasnt like stupid dumb idiot bodhi point break he was trying get away but he always settle score with everyone that double crossed him it is wrong messing with him by end that way leaded him his end he made mistake when he went after waingro kevin gage movie has also one greatest shootouts l which shiherlis val kilmer cheritto tom sizemore mccauley robert de niro firing colt model 733 automatic riffle cops great shootouts i love it movie has great famous cast al pacino robert de niro val kilmer jon voight tom sizemore ashley judd mykelti williamson ted levine dennis haysbert william fichtner natalie portman tom noonan kevin gage danny trejo hank azaria martin ferrero xander berkeley lot famous actors actresses were extra this movie movie focus real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal lifes like you me that is why i love this film death it is realistic performed it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life i love al pacino robert de niros performance they both fit task accomplish their acting their characters heat is 1995 crime drama directed by michael mann marked first screen pairing legendary actors al pacino robert de niro 10 10 my all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece michael mann film all time this movie kicks ass,0.5063784841204194,0.278203421429228,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Brilliant,"This is a brilliant film. While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn't a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film's atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary.

10.0,The best character film of all time.,"Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action.

9.0,The Summit,"One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts. The roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, or Bobby Deefield for Pacino. But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best.You can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget. Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director/writer Michael Mann. We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other. DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work. And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job. He's been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department.Mann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat. People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro's gang, Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation. Pacino on his team has Mykel T. Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk.This action film also does not stint on woman's roles. Diane Venora is fine as Pacino's estranged wife. Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro's woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction. Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer's loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson, betray her husband or lose their kid. See how she handles it.Although the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life, Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner. They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy. Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation, the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension. It's like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened.But like in Heat, it should have happened.",summit,one amazing things about heat is that during almost three hour running time film your interest what happens summit teaming al pacino robert deniro never flags second part reason is because these guys are at top their profession brought their game parts roles they have are not as good as jake lamotta jimmy conway or max cady deniro or frank serpico michael corleone or bobby deefield pacino but neil mccauley master criminal deniro jake hanna dogged detective pacino does show these guys at their best you can best describe heat as long running version law order criminal intent with big budget like that show action shifts back cops criminals smoothly director writer michael mann we see both these guys as rather similar each other deniro prides himself fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work pacino is his third marriage his mistress is job hes been failure twice as husband about go thrice romance department mann gave pacino deniro really outstanding cast support heat people like val kilmer are deniros gang jon voight is sam jaffe like mastermind operation pacino his team has mykel t williamson forrest gump ted levine best known as captain stottlemyre monk this action film also does not stint womans roles diane venora is fine as pacinos estranged wife amy breneman is also good as deniros woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go his destruction best film distaff side is ashley judd as val kilmers loyal wife who has one great choice given her by williamson betray her husband or lose their kid see how she handles it although scene was shoehorned into plot would never happen real life pacino deniro do meet have brief scene together over cup coffee diner they compare notes so speak take measure other guy since these two guys are most acclaimed actors their generation scene artificial though it is takes whole different dimension its like when writers give queen elizabeth mary queen scots climatic meeting scene even though real life it never happened but like heat it should have happened,0.42950450450450456,0.2117117117117117,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,Masterful on all counts,"For some reason I cannot stop thinking about this film lately.You know that feeling of having seen it about 3 or 4 times in the last 12 months is not enough? That's what I feel at the moment.I rate it as Mann's best. It's his most kinetic,vibrant(for a film mostly shot in steely blue),agonising,stirring,brash,violent and brilliance in such a simple story. What games did you play as a young kid? Cops and robbers.Good guy.Bad guy.We all know De Niro and Pacino could have been either main part,but can you imagine it any other way round. Pacino doing ice cool calm? De Niro the manic outbursts,arms flailing? It wouldn't work. We know these men now.We know neither will stop at what they do.And yet there is no way either would stop the other.Unless they had too. Which leads us too the characters. All of them.This is an extended family where you feel you know all of them without knowing anything at all. The cops are similar to the robbers and vice-versa. Perhaps Mann is telling us were all the same.Except in what we do.Every speaking part holds substance in this movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan.

10.0,"Heat is truly epic, absolutely breathtaking","One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.",heat is truly epic absolutely breathtaking,one most amazing things about heat is scale film it is nearly three hours long packed bursting with mind blowing visuals it seems one michael manns main priorities was make film with dreamlike feel it portray la as dusty oil painting which complex characters could play out their lives one main themes is similarity career criminal street wise cop it is fascinating find yourself really feeling deniros tragic bank robber man philosophical merit who realises hes stuck life crime he doesnt want lead pacinos cop is less easy sympathise with but he too leads escapable life guns crime what really stands out is climax whole heat has be best cops n robbers film ever made indeed one best films epic wonderful sad adrenaline fuelled exercise scale grandeur,0.5206666666666667,0.22400000000000003,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.35}"

10.0,You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film.,"Heat (1995) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows an underground high end burglary team looking for one big last mission and a parallel story about a successful police officer who is struggling at home. As the buildup to the big heist unfolds the two worlds come closer and closer together until the ultimate collision happens.This movie is directed by Michael Mann (Ali) and stars Robert De Niro (Goodfellas), Al Pacino (Scarface), Val Kilmer (Willow), Jon Voight (Anaconda), Mykelti Williamson (Forest Gump), Ashley Judd (Kiss the Girls), Tom Sizemore (Black Hawk Down), Wes Studi (Deep Rising), Natalie Portman (Leon: The Professional), Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs) and Dennis Haysbert (Far from Heaven).This cast is absolutely amazing top to bottom. The writing is also excellent and delivers the backstories to each character to perfection and the dialogue is out of this world.

,Mann's crime drama delivers,"'Heat,' a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some. With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann's sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, 'Heat' is arguably one of the best crime dramas.Perhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley. Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters. While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal. Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the ""remnants of dead people."" A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small). His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him. The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together. When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic. To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.In addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters. And the cast is one of the best, at that. DeNiro. Little more needs to be said. Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover. And, despite his life of crime, McCauley's human side shows through. He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist. His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady. Pacino. Equally without need of praise. As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships. He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley. Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be. Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity. Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere. Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives. Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film. Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions). Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine's daughter Lauren. As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro. In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.And Michael Mann's direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama. He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly. He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost. Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous. Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment. He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic. The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever. Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable. And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.Because of these and other well done aspects, 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.",manns crime drama delivers,heat film epic proportions common placed scale provides all essentials great crime drama then some with fascinating storyline involving characters manns sometimes poetic sometimes gritty directing heat is arguably one best crime dramas perhaps most unique feature this movie is its manifold storyline which focuses primarily main characters vincent hanna neil mccauley because this complex storyline it almost seems as if one is watching two movies with one about each two characters while following hannas personal life movie shows how it is about more than just cop pursuit criminal hannas marriage is deteriorating his step daughter is falling apart as wife justine says he lives his life more among remnants dead people man two other failed marriages hannas story is that strain trying fulfill both his professional personal where every time professional wins out neil mccauleys story is that man who used know his role his job everything his life revolved around making next score whether it be large or small his story chronicles his relationships with other men his crew his relationship with eady his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him tensions build as mann shows two opposing strategies each man as their paths thus their stories draw closer together when two storylines do meet at different points movie result is lack better word epic say that these two major storylines are only strong ones movie would do injustice many others following chris his wife example but say that they are driving force movie say that they are responsible transforming typical cops robbers story is best explanation addition characters this movie undoubtedly make it so successful this cast comes as close as possible being ensemble with two such huge main characters cast is one best at that deniro little more needs be said ever master his character mccauley can be one hand ruthless robber cold hearted killer other warm friend tender lover despite his life crime mccauleys human side shows through he will not kill unless he must as seen through his anger at waingro bank heist his warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends girlfriend eady pacino equally without need praise as always he delivers intense performance here as hanna workaholic obsessed with catching his man while also fighting losing battle save his personal relationships he may seem just harsh cop but he cares about every man under his command about his stepdaughter yes even about mccauley through hanna pacino shows just how torn such man can be hanna demonstrates both coldness compassion both anger sensitivity additionally strong is val kilmer as chris shiherlis with raging temper undying devotion fierce will persevere kilmer does excellent job with character flawed individual whose flaws prevent him lasting contentment but against which flaws he continually strives ashley judd is unforgettable charlene shiherlis who despite smaller roll makes lasting impression film tom sizemore as implacable michael cheritto jon voight as gruff nate are both likeable because their human sides despicable because their professions each does excellent work equally fine are diane venora as justine natalie portman as justines daughter lauren as venora is strong opposite pacino so amy brenneman eady is equally strong opposite deniro cast so full big names it is so rewarding see everyone come together make characters each have their own place film michael manns direction movie keeps film moving while providing tremendous combination action drama he moves scene scene quickly effortlessly he also switches between many storylines logically fluidly none story being lost each scene leaves its own unmistakable impression each scene each storyline builds upon previous action scenes are handles crisply but grittily gunshots are loud blood is abundant but mann wisely does not linger horror moment he paints realistic picture but keeps topic action never becomes more important than drama mann is also responsible what is perhaps greatest robbery scene ever here his more gritty sense style is what makes this scene so believable despite enormous cast mann was still able keep his agenda clear orchestrate so much talent into coherent movie michael mann deserves credit both his vision ability express it because these other well done aspects heat is one most powerful crime dramas ever made,0.5257208387942333,0.18919833988641324,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.4}"

10.0,One of the best films of the 90's,"I am assuming I am commenting on this film for those who have not seen this film and for those people I pity you. Its a crime thriller. Won't describe the story as its not particularly original and not the best thing about this film. You've got Pacino and Deniro on screen in a film for the first and possibly last time which should be recommendation enough. You've also got director Michael Mann at the top of his game. An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best ""shoot-out"" in any film - ever. What more do you want???It's a long film but there is not one wasted scene in it. Even the incidental story lines - for example, the recently paroled ex-cell mate of Deniro whose first job is in a ""grill"" working for a nasty, exploitative boss and then ends-up as a stand-in getaway driver for Deniros crew. It just adds weight to the whole film. All the domestic dramas of the good-guys and the bad-guys that you wouldn't get in the typical cops and robbers film are shown in loving detail and nothing is rushed. Just makes it a more satisfying and involving film.Mann who started his career on Miami Vice almost seems to be taking a trip back to the eighties with the soundtrack and styling of the film - almost but not quite. If you still don't want to see the film after this then what the hell's wrong with you?! Sit back and enjoy. Also - no. 247 in the top 250??

10.0,Plain Phenomenal,"Heat is quite possibly the greatest crime/heist film ever made. For nearly 3 hours, it runs in an astounding pace and is loaded with entertainment.Heat is about Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) who him and his crew are professional bank robbers. Neil plans one last heist before his retirement, and that heist goes terribly wrong, leading to homicide. The LAPD are after them, led by Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), and Neil and his team do what they can playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with Vincent and his crew and hopefully make a getaway.Heat is just plain phenomenal. The acting from everyone was awesome. It was great to finally have two legends, De Niro and Pacino, in the same scenes together and they worked so good in the film as well as Val Kilmer turning in an awesome performance.The shootout scenes are epic, especially the famous one that is in the middle of the movie thag is super loud but sounds insanely great. The story was also really well put together, well thought out, and it worked for a 3 hour film. The ending also is so intriguing that it keeps your eyes locked on the screen and makes you really want to see what happens.Bottom line, Heat is one of my all time favorite movies and is actually my 2nd favorite Robert De Niro film (1st being Goodfellas).",plain phenomenal,heat is quite possibly greatest crime heist film ever made nearly 3 hours it runs astounding pace is loaded with entertainment heat is about neil mccauley robert de niro who him his crew are professional bank robbers neil plans one last heist before his retirement that heist goes terribly wrong leading homicide lapd are after them led by lt vincent hanna al pacino neil his team do what they can playing deadly cat mouse game with vincent his crew hopefully make getaway heat is just plain phenomenal acting everyone was awesome it was great finally have two legends de niro pacino same scenes together they worked so good film as well as val kilmer turning awesome performance shootout scenes are epic especially famous one that is middle movie thag is super loud but sounds insanely great story was also really well put together well thought out it worked 3 hour film ending also is so intriguing that it keeps your eyes locked screen makes you really want see what happens bottom line heat is one my all time favorite movies is actually my 2nd favorite robert de niro film 1st being goodfellas,0.5442780337941628,0.2840245775729646,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.35}"
,Gangster Movies: Part 2,"The flaw of all gangster movies, at least those acknowledged as ""classics"" (Godfather trilogy, Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino, White Heat, Once Upon A Time In America etc), is how obvious and predictable their narrative progressions are. We get the rise, the joyous ecstasy of crime and the obvious monetary rewards, and the fall, that period where the world violently collapses around the criminal. With the scripts all so loosely similar, it just becomes a game of dress up. Of who has the best period details, acting and set design.Released the same year as Scorsese's ""Casino"", Michael Mann's ""Heat"" positions itself as one of the first ""neo liberal"" gangster movies, all the others still caught in the old framework of mafia patriarchy, family values, loyalty, honour, total adherence to a distinctive creed, blood lines and tribalism. ""Heat"", in comparison, completely breaks away from these old-fashioned ways. In Mann's film, everyone is an individual in the most extreme sense. The gang is no longer a gang, but a crew of ""independent professionals"" who just come together for a specific job and then split. In this world, families and friends are non-existent or total charades.While Don Corleone hid like a king behind his armed guards and giant fences, Mann's gangsters are trapped in a state of perpetual mobility. Like a group of shareholders, they are held together only by the prospect of future revenue. Their arrangement is temporary, pragmatic and lateral. They know that they are interchangeable parts in a larger machine, that there are no guarantees and that nothing lasts. Compared to this, the gangsters of ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Godfather"" seem like stagnated sentimentalists, nostalgically trapped in dying communities. While The Corleone's fight over territory and family honour, Mann's guys are only interested in Capital. As DeNiro yells during a bank heist, ""We're here for the bank's money, not your money!""Tellingly, the DeNiro character's creed is one of ""zero loyalty"". He has a 30-second rule of walking away from anyone, however close he may be emotionally or romantically. The message of the film is thus double edged. It isn't just that the film's final resolution is that ""justice prevails"" and the bad guys are put away; rather, it is that those who fall, who get caught, are those who failed to live up to the modern creed, which is actually repeated twice in the film: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" In other words, late capitalism and attachment do not mix.So in this sense, a film like ""Heat"", though otherwise entirely predictable, essentially a bunch of little boys engaging in idiot machismo one-upmanship posturing (Pacino's obsessive-compulsive manic cop vs DeNiro's cool sociopathic dedication, etc), nevertheless was one of the first films to manifest a fundamental social change. A series like ""The Wire"" then takes all of this much further, with its attempt to consciously map out the vast and unrepresentable complexity of contemporary neo-liberal capitalism. (In fact, a series like ""The Wire"", with its sheer scope, complexity and writing credentials, renders ALL gangster and crime movies irrelevant to any serious viewer.)And so today's gangsters are all ""entrepreneurs"", all so called ""self-made individuals"", the ""self-employed Petite bourgeoisie"", radically without any social links, even down to the kid selling crack to his buddies. This is all a million light years from the long obsolete world of ""The Godfather"", ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"". While those elegiac films are about moments that had long passed, Mann's is distinctively modern. This is a film about the 90s. This is a Los Angeles of polished chrome, designer kitchens, featureless freeways, fluorescent bulbs and late night diners. All the colours, sounds, aromas and cultural quirks of Coppola and Scorsese have been torn out, painted over, re-fitted and re-modelled. Mann's LA is a world without landmarks. A vast urban sprawl, all traces of Old Europe replaced by business franchises, multiplexes and multinational coffee shops. While Coppola's film centred around a family called the ""Corleone's"", their name itself a reference to the village in which they originated, Mann's criminals have bland names like ""Neil"". They are without history, culture or family ties. In a brilliant touch, Mann even has De Niro reading a book on metals when he first meets his love interest. The guy is a piece of cold, polished steel in a world that is likewise.Rather than a ""rise/fall"" structure we also get something a bit different. These criminals get no joy from their profession. Trapped in a world of paranoia, Mann's aesthetic is one of flat glass panes and expansive windows, his criminals always fearing exposure. For Mann, crime becomes a means of escape from the world in its entirety. Crime is total disconnection from both family, society and man, his criminals all looking to amass enough wealth to escape to some idyllic island on the horizon.But it's Mann's style itself that seduces us. This style, which I call ""Armani decorum"", owes much to Mann's fondness for such painters and architects as David Hockney, Alex Colville, Edward Hopper and Ed Ruscha (Alex Colville's ""Pacific"" is visually quoted in one shot). Mann's thus trades the ""old noir"" look for 1950's modernism, block colours, expansive glass panes, geometric divisions and contemporary, linear houses. His frame is divided into flat surfaces, characters are dressed in pastels, scenes are assigned panels of light and buildings are relentlessly modernist, with fluorescent bulbs and geometrical, flat surfaces. Couple this with his unique choice in music (minimalist, industrial and techno) and you have a very sexy aesthetic.8.9/10 – Dismissed upon release, ""Heat"" achieved ""classic"" status a few years later due to young film buffs. As the star status of De Niro and Pacino fades, and films like ""Dark Knight"" rip off its style, the film seems to be on another downward spiral.Worth several viewings.",gangster movies part 2,flaw

9.0,a masterpiece crime drama/action hybrid with memorable performances,"I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for the drawn out ""climax"" and the whole tangent between De Niro and his woman. I understand the necessity of that element, but his character is so indifferent throughout that it lost me completely. That said, about his character, I get it; he isn't supposed to be flamboyant, he's rigid and unforgiving, he lives by a strict creed, and De Niro nails it flawlessly. He just isn't nearly my favorite character. And there's so many to pick from! Heat offers you a slew of people to latch onto, emotionally and empathetically, or even apathetically. Every character showcases his own qualities and flaws, making even the bad guys likable in some cases, but when it comes right down to it they are, clear as day, the bad guys. And all the actors and actresses put on stellar performances. Al Pacino especially; Val Kilmer was a favorite for me, and even Waingro, as despicable a man as he was in the movie, depicted so memorably by Kevin Gage. Even Danny Trejo, who is such a small role, has. Subtle yet powerful performance in the third act. And then there's the action. While the movie is undeniably long, it isn't boring, with the exception of my aforementioned gripe with De Niro's romantic tangent. Aside from that, even when guns aren't blazing (every gunfight is raw and gritty and intensely filmed), there is action to be had. The script is ingenious and cinematography immersive.

,"Intelligent, tense, and thrilling, Mann's ""Heat"" is more than an just an ordinary crime film","""Heat"", much more than a typical crime drama, is a character-driven masterpiece of writing and a film so riveting and fascinating that one cannot take his or her eyes off the film for one second without possibly missing a masterful shot or a fine bit of character development. If the film's intelligent, appropriately 'epic', character-driven screenplay wasn't enough to make this a great film, then surely Mann's brilliant direction, Dante Spinotti's photography, and Elliot Goldenthal's memorable score make this a great film.Of course, the big selling point for ""Heat"" to this day is the union of screen legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. I am not certain whether the film's excellent screenplay was written by Mann with these two actors in mind, but it doesn't feel like it because it does not feel for a second like a cheap marketing gimmick, and the two actors actually share very little screen time together (for the first time, as despite both of them appearing in ""The Godfather: Part II"", they were not in any scenes together). When they do, it is tasteful and interesting. The scene in the diner where they first really meet, not counting a quick encounter on the street just before, is perhaps the true centerpiece of the film, even more so than the famed shootout. In that short, beautiful scene the two main characters discover just how similar to and yet different from each other they are. The film is brilliantly. It is around three hours in length, but passes faster than most 90 minute films. The film masterfully builds tension while developing characters in its early stages in what some might call subplots, which is entirely missing the point of this film being driven by the characters rather than strictly by the plot. The film has a loose 'main' plot, but is a true epic, one which concentrates on many different characters and stories in almost equal measure. It builds up to a climax which lasts for an entire hour, a riveting, spectacular, epic, brilliant hour of film that begins with the shootout. Oh, the great, famous ""Heat"" shootout in the middle of the street in broad daylight. My opinion may be blasphemy to some, but I think this is one of the best and most exciting scenes in film history. It's as well-shot and edited as any of cinema's most well-known action scenes.The immediate thing that stands out about the visual look of the film is how carefully and beautifully composed some of the shots are, the prime example being the film's stunning final shot (which follows an equally astonishing final sequence), which is certainly up there with the great final shots in cinema. The film's look cannot be credited entirely to Mann, as frequent Mann collaborator (The Last of the Mohicans, The Insider) Dante Spinotti's work as cinematographer is certainly impressive as well. This cast is certainly much bigger than Pacino and De Niro, and I can't think of one performance, not even Jon Voight's that can be called anything less than excellent. From Val Kilmer to Tom Sizemore to Ted Levine to Ashley Judd, the supporting cast is terrific. Even Natalie Portman's good.""Heat"" is a masterclass. The writing, direction, cinematography, acting, everything about the film is great from start to finish. Truly a brilliant film, and one that will not be forgotten anytime soon.

,A stylish masterwork worthy of the talent involved,"I am always wary of films boasting of star-studded casts and big-name, behind-the-camera talent. So, I approached ""Heat"" with some trepidation...of course, I'm a big fan of DeNiro and Pacino (even as he has declined into one-note, manic performances in the 90's) and I feel that Michael Mann is one of the most underrated directors in Tinseltown (one need only view ""Manhunter"" to view his genius in pacing a crime thriller). Given the incredible supporting cast, this production set high standards for itself. I must report that it did not disappoint. Given that the running time is almost three hours and Mann has the task of balancing two significant storylines (DeNiro's and Pacino's), the film is a stunningly linear examination of life on both sides of the law. The viewer sees sacrifices made and relationships lost in both arenas without the usual emotional push to root for one side against the other. The visceral thrill of watching Pacino and DeNiro emote together was one of the film's marketing points; though they have two brief scenes together, it is a unique thrill to see these two modern icons of cinema play off one another. While it is clear that either of these two has the star power to carry a film singlehandedly, the experience of watching the cop and robber suffer through their diametrically opposed, yet parallel lives is fascinating. I'm sure that fans of the films will remember, in the years to come, the diner scene between the two as fondly as some hold the pairing of Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea in ""Ride The High Country"".Those who criticized the film at the time of its release found particular fault with the climax. They cynically deemed the clasping of hands between the two opponents as a overly sentimental gesture. While it is sentimental, the scene is a neat capsulation of their relationship, however unexplored, throughout the film. They have acted as the hunter and his prey; yet, they finally realize that they are kindred spirits - dedicated men who put their chosen profession above all else in their lives. They are aware of the opportunities for ""normalcy"" they have sacrificed for their obsessions (I love DeNiro's line in the diner on what's normal) and hold each other in high regard because they share the same pain and isolation. I think ""Heat"" has a beautiful ending, enhanced by Moby's elegiac ""God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters""I don't put much stock in the Academy Awards in terms of evaluating a film's worth, but it was a true disgrace that ""Braveheart"" was chosen Best Picture in 1995. ""Heat"" was not even nominated! Hopefully, the Academy voters will right this error with Mann's equally powerful ""Insider"" at this year's ceremonies.Don't be scared off by ""Heat""'s running time or by criticism that its too indulgent in its character studies. It is precisely the film's attention to developing its characters that sets it apart from every other by-the-numbers Hollywood crime film of this era and makes ""Heat"" a classic.",stylish masterwork worthy talent involved,i am always wary films boasting star studded casts big name behind camera talent so i approached heat with some trepidation course im big fan deniro pacino even as he has declined into one note manic performances 90s i feel that michael mann is one most underrated directors tinseltown one need only view manhunter view his genius pacing crime thriller given incredible supporting cast this production set high standards itself i must report that it did not disappoint given that running time is almost three hours mann has task balancing two significant storylines deniros pacinos film is stunningly linear examination life both sides law viewer sees sacrifices made relationships lost both arenas without usual emotional push root one side against other visceral thrill watching pacino deniro emote together was one films marketing points though they have two brief scenes together it is unique thrill see these two modern icons cinema play off one another while it is clear that either these two has star power carry film singlehandedly experience watching cop robber suffer through their diametrically opposed yet parallel lives is fascinating im sure that fans films will remember years come diner scene between two as fondly as some hold pairing randolph scott joel mccrea ride high country those who criticized film at time its release found particular fault with climax they cynically deemed clasping hands between two opponents as overly sentimental gesture while it is sentimental scene is neat capsulation their relationship however unexplored throughout film they have acted as hunter his prey yet they finally realize that they are kindred spirits dedicated men who put their chosen profession above all else their lives they are aware opportunities normalcy they have sacrificed their obsessions i love deniros line diner whats normal hold each other high regard because they share same pain isolation i think heat has beautiful ending enhanced by mobys elegiac god moving over face waters i dont put much stock academy awards terms evaluating films worth but it was true disgrace that braveheart was chosen best picture 1995 heat was not even nominated hopefully academy voters will right this error with manns equally powerful insider at this years ceremonies dont be scared off by heat s running time or by criticism that its too indulgent its character studies it is precisely films attention developing its characters that sets it apart every other by numbers hollywood crime film this era makes heat classic,0.5725276052449966,0.1740734989648033,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.38}"
