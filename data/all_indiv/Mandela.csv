9,Fictional but powerful!!,"There are some movies that bashes on politics and corruption in the name of political drama. But, this movie is refreshing with multiple new angles - not vilifying the antagonist - they have a proper motive which the hero lacks, corrupt people - in fact everyone has a corrupt side right from the townsmen, the wives and even our hero. The beauty of this movie is the concept of 'one vote'. How the villains and the hero uses it makes it an absolutely engaging watch.

8,Tales from Tamil Nadu !!,"Quality movies are rare in Tamil cinema, movies that impress both mainstream audiences and film connoisseurs are rarer, full credit to director Madonne Ashwin, Tamil audiences get a chance to experience something that is very well crafted and swashbuckling, at least once in 3 years. It's a big shame that Mandela couldn't garner a much wider theatrical release. Mandela is a comical political satire, that is wonderfully presented to us by its loveable, authentic, rustic, well defined and strong characters led by the inimitable Yogi Babu.Mandela has a strong storyline, that will make the viewers think and inspire in various ways. Cinematography is topnotch, with the DOP's choice of filter aiding the mood of the tale. Screenplay laced with some sprinkling of black humour is near masterpiece levels, it is fresh yet very profound and strong. Production design and makeup are good. Costumes are very good and accurate, a rarity in Tamil movies. Music with its songs are outstanding in some portions.Yogi Babu as a lead actor, delivers wonderfully well, ably supported by by a huge brigade of junior artistes, led by Sheela Rajkumar.Overall, Mandela is an brilliant all round film that answers some questions on socio-political spectrum in a mature way. The movie is designed for the entire family, again which is a rarity these days. The raw film is a thorough voice over of the common man and is brutally open and honest to the point of answering questions that have no answers. There is not a single dull moment in the screenplay, Two Thumbs for story, direction and for the satire.

8,A political satire that's well worth your time! [+77%],"The one-vote-makes-a-difference story was tackled in a tepid, commercial manner in A R Murugadoss' Sarkar back in 2018. Mandela, written and directed by Madonne Ashwin, strips itself off usual Tamil cinema tropes, positions itself as a no-holds-barred political satire (without pointing fingers), and most importantly, entertains for nearly 140 minutes. The film is set in a small village, closely following events that lead up to a local body election, where two half-brothers are battling it out. Caste division is rampant in the village, distinguishing people as either Southerners or Northerners. You can picture this story play out not just in rural Tamil Nadu, but in entire rural India.Yogi Babu plays Smile, the local barber, who becomes an overnight sensation as his vote is deemed the deciding factor in the election. The simple, straightforward story is given the comical treatment with almost all one-liners tickling our funny bone. There is a host of interesting characters too, with great comedic timing. In fact, they can transition from funny to menacing to funny again in a matter of seconds. Leading from the front is a restrained Yogi Babu (who adopts the name Nelson Mandela in the film), who gets to display his acting chops without having to resort to stale, body-shaming humour. His teenaged side-kick (aptly named Sideburn) is also on point here.Ashwin deserves applause for tackling such a publicly-known-yet-rarely-discussed issue of caste politics and corruption with reasonable maturity. The film does feel slightly stretched in the second half, but the final 30 minutes compensates for that with a lot of fun, feel-good moments. Another appreciable aspect is how Thenmozhi, the newly appointed postwoman, is the one that sets the engrossing chain of events in motion. She isn't just an appear-and-disappearing heroine. I liked how she, along with the leader of the village panchayat, both command presence in the film's climax.Mandela is a neat pick by Netflix. It deserves to be seen by a much larger audience, beyond the borders of Tamil Nadu. I had a great time with it!",political satire thats well worth your time,one vote makes difference story was tackled tepid commercial manner r murugadoss sarkar back 2018 mandela written directed by madonne ashwin strips itself off usual tamil cinema tropes positions itself as no holds barred political satire without pointing fingers most importantly entertains nearly 140 minutes film is set small village closely following events that lead up local body election where two half brothers are battling it out caste division is rampant village distinguishing people as either southerners or northerners you can picture this story play out not just rural tamil nadu but entire rural india yogi babu plays smile local barber who becomes overnight sensation as his vote is deemed deciding factor election simple straightforward story is given comical treatment with almost all one liners tickling our funny bone there is host interesting characters too with great comedic timing fact they can transition funny menacing funny again matter seconds leading front is restrained yogi babu who adopts name nelson mandela film who gets display his acting chops without having resort stale body shaming humour his teenaged side kick aptly named sideburn is also point here ashwin deserves applause tackling such publicly known yet rarely discussed issue caste politics corruption with reasonable maturity film does feel slightly stretched second half but final 30 minutes compensates that with lot fun feel good moments another appreciable aspect is how thenmozhi newly appointed postwoman is one that sets engrossing chain events motion she isnt just appear disappearing heroine i liked how she along with leader village panchayat both command presence films climax mandela is neat pick by netflix it deserves be seen by much larger audience beyond borders tamil nadu i had great time with it,0.4347041847041846,0.14173400673400674,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.49}"

7,Madela is a Terrific Satirical Entertainner set in Election battlefield and Castism Issues which shows the power of ONE DAMN VOTE!,"Madela (2021) : Movie Review -Tamil Cinemas deserves a big round of applause for taking this subject on. The cinematic aspects can be discussed later but firstly a loud scream only for making this satirical and revolutionary film. Mandela is a political satire set in the election battlefield where nothing matters except for vote but surprisingly it goes beyond that to send a few revolutionary thoughts to all the voters of the country. It is an absolute entertainer with lots of humour but moreover it is must attend thought-provoking seminar for every 18+ person in the society.So, Madela is about a barber from the low caste who is almost like an exiled begger in the village. His fate turns overnight when he becomes the single deciding vote in the village elections. Now, here he decided to live for himself only to cause him dangerous implications and then how he brings a revolutionary change in the village is all you get to see in the film. The writing is top notch considering the value of this subject and how carefully it is handled without breaking any set terms of electoral process. The screenplay adds entertaining elements to keep it engaging and crispy and it also keeps many surprises in store.Madela is a story of a barber hence he's the man who gets all the attraction throughout the film but unexpectedly it has plenty of supporting roles having solid impact and longer screen presence. Yogi Babu as Mandela is hilarious and technically very sounded according to different different situations. Sheela Rajkumar as his female interest is simple but effective. You know, keeping the romance and typical love story aside is one of the finest thing happened to Mandela. The storyline did not required any useless romance just to please the mainstream massy audience and it's a very good thing that this Sheela Rajkumar's character didn't go that way. In supporting roles, GM Sundar and Kanna Ravi share a blasting chemistry of rivals.Talking about the technical aspects, Mandela is by far decent here. It doesn't add up anything from the music and cinematography due the completely repulsive content but using all the stuff as per requirement has helped the film to look more real. Director Madonne Ashwin has written it too, so he knew exactly what to do it and how to present it. Comedy, humour, drama, emotions and social awakening he kept all the ingredients in correct sizes, none of them overtakes any. Ashwin also puts enough heart touching moments like the climax scene and disturbing ones like the casteism and inequality. A special mention to the dialogue writer for some clapworthy one liners. One the best one goes like this, ""You don't know how to vote but you know to make money from that vote."" Claps! Overall, Madela is one of the most socially important films coming from south cinema and deserves your attention for so many reasons. Watch it.RATING - 7/10*",madela is terrific satirical entertainner set election battlefield castism issues which shows power one damn vote,madela 2021 movie review tamil cinemas deserves big round applause taking this subject cinematic aspects can be discussed later but firstly loud scream only making this satirical revolutionary film mandela is political satire set election battlefield where nothing matters except vote but surprisingly it goes beyond that send few revolutionary thoughts all voters country it is absolute entertainer with lots humour but moreover it is must attend thought provoking seminar every 18 person society so madela is about barber low caste who is almost like exiled begger village his fate turns overnight when he becomes single deciding vote village elections now here he decided live himself only cause him dangerous implications then how he brings revolutionary change village is all you get see film writing is top notch considering value this subject how carefully it is handled without breaking any set terms electoral process screenplay adds entertaining elements keep it engaging crispy it also keeps many surprises store madela is story barber hence hes man who gets all attraction throughout film but unexpectedly it has plenty supporting roles having solid impact longer screen presence yogi babu as mandela is hilarious technically very sounded according different different situations sheela rajkumar as his female interest is simple but effective you know keeping romance typical love story aside is one finest thing happened mandela storyline did not required any useless romance just please mainstream massy audience its very good thing that this sheela rajkumars character didnt go that way supporting roles gm sundar kanna ravi share blasting chemistry rivals talking about technical aspects mandela is by far decent here it doesnt add up anything music cinematography due completely repulsive content but using all stuff as per requirement has helped film look more real director madonne ashwin has written it too so he knew exactly what do it how present it comedy humour drama emotions social awakening he kept all ingredients correct sizes none them overtakes any ashwin also puts enough heart touching moments like climax scene disturbing ones like casteism inequality special mention dialogue writer some clapworthy one liners one best one goes like this you dont know how vote but you know make money that vote claps overall madela is one most socially important films coming south cinema deserves your attention so many reasons watch it rating 7 10,0.4897284878863828,0.14310663021189335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9,"A brilliant, no-nonsense, thought-provoking movie.","People are calling this an amazing political satire but I think it's an injustice to the movie to call it just a political satire when it addresses SO MANY other issues with out society. Sure, there's politics in the movie, but there's issues about caste, identity, gender-based discrimination, ignorance, and so on. And it doesn't feel like the movie is trying to do too much at any point.The acting in the movie was amazing by everyone involved. Yogi Baby has come a looong way and props to him! There were so many metaphors, so much symbolism in the movie.This is a funny but deep movie. You'll laugh, be shocked at the same time, and will catch yourself saying ""Actually, this is nothing to be shocked about, that's exactly how it would be/is in real life. Nothing is gonna change.""But that's the point of the movie, to tell this story of how each vote matters and how things CAN change, or at the very least, lets at least talk about these issues in real life as a Step 1 and be hopeful for change.Would totally recommend. 2 hours only!",brilliant no nonsense thought provoking movie,people are calling this amazing political satire but i think its injustice movie call it just political satire when it addresses so many other issues with out society sure theres politics movie but theres issues about caste identity gender based discrimination ignorance so it doesnt feel like movie is trying do too much at any point acting movie was amazing by everyone involved yogi baby has come looong way props him there were so many metaphors so much symbolism movie this is funny but deep movie youll laugh be shocked at same time will catch yourself saying actually this is nothing be shocked about thats exactly how it would be is real life nothing is gonna change but thats point movie tell this story how each vote matters how things can change or at very least lets at least talk about these issues real life as step 1 be hopeful change would totally recommend 2 hours only,0.48111111111111116,0.1148076923076923,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.46, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.29}"

9,Mandela is a must-watch comedy-drama that would make you realize the social issues revolving around the society that we are all living in today,"Tamil films have been enlightening issues that have been widely affecting the Tamil people. Starting from the typical political corruption to the importance of a vote, many films have spoken about the politics that surround a common man's life. Madonne Ashwin's Mandela can be termed as one of its kind and a film that has everything to grab your attention. Mandela speaks loudly about politics, caste issues, and the importance of a vote. The way that Madonne used to tell his story must be appreciated for its uniqueness and its strong vision on politics. This is definitely not a political film but instead, a strong comedy-drama. Madonne Ashwin blended the right ingredients to create a sort of perfect meal for the day. The comedies are really natural and super hilarious. Especially with Yogi Babu on board, there are no limitations for comedies. Mandela is undoubtedly the best film of Yogi Babu to date. He is the heart and soul of this film. Right from the beginning till the climax, his portrayal as the common man who struggles to find a place for himself in a society that rejects him for his identity and his caste reveals to us his true essence as an actor. Yogi Babu as Mandela is naive and innocent with the hope of achieving the dream of his father which is to build a big saloon in his village. The hurdles and the pains that he went throughout the film would be hard-hitting and enlights the typical issues that are in real society. Madonne Ashwin brought us the best performance of Yogi Babu. The way that he has crafted his role would be an eye-opener for many filmmakers on how to bring out a true performance from a widely known comedian aka an underrated actor. Mandela is the definition of how a film can be hilarious as well as remarkable for its social issues. This is not the typical Shankar film or A. R. Murugadoss film to keep you awake about the serious issues through countless strong dialogues and a portrayal of people suffering from corruption. Mandela is a film that doesn't need any of the above mentions. It's a film that realistically portrays the issues faced by a common man within the comedy genre. Madonne Ashwin creates some kind of relatability with the emotional and quite realistic narration. The film is real and pure. There are no special effects or unnecessary subplots. Mandela dives into its initial plot right from the word go. Madonne has made sure that the film's main strength lies in its writing. He has written memorable scenes with the environment itself being a character in the film. There are many valuable scenes that not only bring out the laughter needed but also make us think about it even after the end. Many scenes are well executed and their true value can be seen by the visually pleasing cinematography. Every character in the film has a scope and a unique identity which is probably why people can relate to it easily. It's worth saying that Mandela is definitely a memorable film in Tamil cinema. It's one of the few films that I had no issues with it. Overall, Mandela is a must-watch comedy-drama that would make you realize the social issues revolving around the society that we are all living in today.",mandela is must watch comedy drama that would make you realize social issues revolving around society that we are all living today,tamil films have been enlightening issues that have been widely affecting tamil people starting typical political corruption importance vote many films have spoken about politics that surround common mans life madonne ashwins mandela can be termed as one its kind film that has everything grab your attention mandela speaks loudly about politics caste issues importance vote way that madonne used tell his story must be appreciated its uniqueness its strong vision politics this is definitely not political film but instead strong comedy drama madonne ashwin blended right ingredients create sort perfect meal day comedies are really natural super hilarious especially with yogi babu board there are no limitations comedies mandela is undoubtedly best film yogi babu date he is heart soul this film right beginning till climax his portrayal as common man who struggles find place himself society that rejects him his identity his caste reveals us his true essence as actor yogi babu as mandela is naive innocent with hope achieving dream his father which is build big saloon his village hurdles pains that he went throughout film would be hard hitting enlights typical issues that are real society madonne ashwin brought us best performance yogi babu way that he has crafted his role would be eye opener many filmmakers how bring out true performance widely known comedian aka underrated actor mandela is definition how film can be hilarious as well as remarkable its social issues this is not typical shankar film or r murugadoss film keep you awake about serious issues through countless strong dialogues portrayal people suffering corruption mandela is film that doesnt need any above mentions its film that realistically portrays issues faced by common man within comedy genre madonne ashwin creates some kind relatability with emotional quite realistic narration film is real pure there are no special effects or unnecessary subplots mandela dives into its initial plot right word go madonne has made sure that films main strength lies its writing he has written memorable scenes with environment itself being character film there are many valuable scenes that not only bring out laughter needed but also make us think about it even after end many scenes are well executed their true value can be seen by visually pleasing cinematography every character film has scope unique identity which is probably why people can relate it easily its worth saying that mandela is definitely memorable film tamil cinema its one few films that i had no issues with it overall mandela is must watch comedy drama that would make you realize social issues revolving around society that we are all living today,0.5294312169312169,0.19999999999999998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"
