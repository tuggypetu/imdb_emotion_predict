10.0,"Give Vishal Bharadwaj a solid pat on the back, and sit back waiting for his next movie.","Give Vishal Bharadwaj a solid pat on the back, and sit back waiting for his next movie. This man seethes brilliance in his film-making. His dialogues, his script, his music, and his direction - all are top-notch, and as I said, this movie proves that Makdi was no fluke. The movie is based on Macbeth; and oh does it stay faithful to the story. For setting, Vishal trades the Lord & Lady for 'Bhai' (Gangster) and Mistress in today's Mumbai underworld complete with corrupt cops, loads of handguns and conniving politicians. The story follows Maqbool (Macbeth: Irfan Khan), the right-hand man of Abbaji (King Duncan: Pankaj Kapoor) - the most powerful and influential ganglord in Mumbai. Abbaji's mistress Nimmi (Lady Macbeth: Tabu) falls in love with Maqbool & inspires him to kill Abbaji and take-over his empire. What they did not expect was the surfacing of guilt, and loyals to Abbaji. Vishal projects the story from inside the crime-family, playing with the loyalties of the viewer. Every character is built deep; you can't find yourself rooting for or against anyone, so justified is each in his/her actions. Add to that the wonderful dialogues & screenplay hiding a mock to reality, society and movies. Watching this movie alone at home, I applauded on a regular basis - so fulfilling was the experience. The best 'character translation' of the play for me was morphing the three witches that haunt Macbeth into the two corrupt cops, as played by the brilliant-to-a-fault Naseeruddin Shah & Om Puri. The two actors signed up for the smaller roles just to have a chance to work with each other after a long time, and oh are there sparks on screen. If this was Hollywood, we would see a spin-off on their characters. Most of the hum-our-draped satire comes from these two, and it is the kind of hum-our you shake your head at, not roll laughing at. Although I like Naseer more, Om gets and does the better part here. Irfan Khan IS the successor of these two actors. He again portrays a character as if he was born to play it. From his matter-of-fact way of delivering lines to the screamingly clear eyes, he is a treat to watch. Tabu plays Lady Macbeth as her usual self. Nothing beyond competent, but nothing below either. And Pankaj Kapoor: He again proves how under-rated he is. From the tormented scientist in Ek Doctor ki Maut to the hilarious possessive father in Chameli ki Shaadi, this guy has done all of the variety and is as good as the best, but never got the recognition that Naseer & Om got. Indeed, Kapoor redefines the Indian gang lord, and surpasses all previous attempts at such a role. His Abbaji is the most captivating character in the movie, yet the most firmly rooted in reality. It defines: If Mumbai has a Godfather, this is he or how he should be. Each of the actors that have portrayed their respective characters, I can't think of even one major character being replaced by any other in bollywood. I rate this film 4.5 of 5 ---- Trivia: - The first scene of the movie shows a minion with Naseer & Om Puri. This thin faced bald actor is the co-screen-writer Abbas Tyrewala putting in a cameo. - Naseerudding Shah conducted a workshop for all actors in the movie for a few days before start of filming, to get everyone in character and for natural interactions. - Shekhar Kapoor saw this movie at a European (I forget which) Film Festival, and offered Vishal a movie then & there. They discussed plans till dawn. - Macbeth is Vishal's favourite play. He wanted to make a movie for mature audiences after his debut with the children's movie Makdee (Shabana Azmi played the witch for free in that one!)",give vishal bharadwaj solid pat back sit back waiting his next movie,give vishal bharadwaj solid pat back sit back waiting his next movie this man seethes brilliance his film making his dialogues his script his music his direction all are top notch as i said this movie proves that makdi was no fluke movie is based macbeth oh does it stay faithful story setting vishal trades lord lady bhai gangster mistress todays mumbai underworld complete with corrupt cops loads handguns conniving politicians story follows maqbool macbeth irfan khan right hand man abbaji king duncan pankaj kapoor most powerful influential ganglord mumbai abbajis mistress nimmi lady macbeth tabu falls love with maqbool inspires him kill abbaji take over his empire what they did not expect was surfacing guilt loyals abbaji vishal projects story inside crime family playing with loyalties viewer every character is built deep you cant find yourself rooting or against anyone so justified is each his her actions add that wonderful dialogues screenplay hiding mock reality society movies watching this movie alone at home i applauded regular basis so fulfilling was experience best character translation play me was morphing three witches that haunt macbeth into two corrupt cops as played by brilliant fault naseeruddin shah om puri two actors signed up smaller roles just have chance work with each other after long time oh are there sparks screen if this was hollywood we would see spin off their characters most hum our draped satire comes these two it is kind hum our you shake your head at not roll laughing at although i like naseer more om gets does better part here irfan khan is successor these two actors he again portrays character as if he was born play it his matter fact way delivering lines screamingly clear eyes he is treat watch tabu plays lady macbeth as her usual self nothing beyond competent but nothing below either pankaj kapoor he again proves how under rated he is tormented scientist ek doctor ki maut hilarious possessive father chameli ki shaadi this guy has done all variety is as good as best but never got recognition that naseer om got indeed kapoor redefines indian gang lord surpasses all previous attempts at such role his abbaji is most captivating character movie yet most firmly rooted reality it defines if mumbai has godfather this is he or how he should be each actors that have portrayed their respective characters i cant think even one major character being replaced by any other bollywood i rate this film 4 5 5 trivia first scene movie shows minion with naseer om puri this thin faced bald actor is co screen writer abbas tyrewala putting cameo naseerudding shah conducted workshop all actors movie few days before start filming get everyone character natural interactions shekhar kapoor saw this movie at european i forget which film festival offered vishal movie then there they discussed plans till dawn macbeth is vishals favourite play he wanted make movie mature audiences after his debut with childrens movie makdee shabana azmi played witch free that one,0.4323139125025918,0.20531221922731357,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.49}"
10.0,Is Vishal Bhardwaj India's Best?,"This film is, in short, a masterpiece. A unique interpretation on Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", ""Maqbool"" features Irrfan in one of the most brilliantly executed roles of modern cinema. He remarkably inhabits the skin of a character who is muddled, murderous, and maniacal. Pankaj Kapoor, as the invincible Abbaji, is astonishing in his portrayal of the Muslim Mob Boss. Truly an incomparable performance. As for Tabu, she is PERFECTION. This is not Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth- she is equally fierce, but given a softer and more shadowy countenance. Tabu is officially a text book of acting (take note, screen queens Rani, Preity, Aish, Madhuri, and the rest- this is what a REAL actress can do). Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri give expert portrayals. Kudos to Bhardwaj for creating a film which is not only unconventional, but eerily radiant. Ram Gopal Verma and Mani Ratnam now have company as India's most innovative filmmakers.",is vishal bhardwaj indias best,this film is short masterpiece unique interpretation shakespeares macbeth maqbool features irrfan one most brilliantly executed roles modern cinema he remarkably inhabits skin character who is muddled murderous maniacal pankaj kapoor as invincible abbaji is astonishing his portrayal muslim mob boss truly incomparable performance as tabu she is perfection this is not shakespeares lady macbeth she is equally fierce but given softer more shadowy countenance tabu is officially text book acting take note screen queens rani preity aish madhuri rest this is what real actress can do naseeruddin shah om puri give expert portrayals kudos bhardwaj creating film which is not only unconventional but eerily radiant ram gopal verma mani ratnam now have company as indias most innovative filmmakers,0.58125,0.3953125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.27, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.2}"

8.0,Macbeth comes to Mumbai,"Vishal Bhardwaj has proven Rudyard Kipling wrong. West does meet East.I just came back after watching Maqbool directed by Vishal Bhardwaj (remember Makdee or the music director of Maachis?).And i am stunned. In this brilliant film, Macbeth meets Mumbai with such ease that i didn't think it would be possible.It is an adaptation of Shakespeare's MACBETH. Only Duncan is the king of underworld (Abbaji - Pankaj Kapoor). Macbeth is Mian Maqbool (Irfan Khan). Lady Macbeth is Nimmi (Tabu). Macduff is Kaka (Piyush Mishra) And the kingdom is present-day Mumbai.Around them are India's best acting talents: Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri, and Ajay Gehi.This film is slightly different from Macbeth though. Macbeth is driven by his love for the throne. Maqbool is driven by his love for Nimmi.He murders Abbaji and declares himself the leader of the gang. The underworld is in a state of shock and everyone suspects Maqbool. But no one dares raise a voice against him. Maqbool then goes on to murder his close friend Kaka to gain absolute power.He is led (or misled) in his endeavour by two corrupt cops. (Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah). They essay the role of the three witches in Macbeth.The performances are of a high order. Pankaj Kapur delivers his career-best performance. Followed closely by Tabu. In fact it is a photo finish.Vishal Bhardwaj is a great storyteller. He imbues the film with a number of sparkling sequences and dialogues. Bhardwaj and writer Abbas Tyrewala do not resort to gimmicks and instead have been as realistic as possible. The guilt pangs that Nimmi and Maqbool suffer after Abbaji's murder is one phase that takes the film to a different high altogether.In the end, all i can say is, Maqbool has the potential to be a landmark film in Bollywood. In spite of its shabby marketing.",macbeth comes mumbai,vishal bhardwaj has proven rudyard kipling wrong west does meet east i just came back after watching maqbool directed by vishal bhardwaj remember makdee or music director maachis i am stunned this brilliant film macbeth meets mumbai with such ease that i didnt think it would be possible it is adaptation shakespeares macbeth only duncan is king underworld abbaji pankaj kapoor macbeth is mian maqbool irfan khan lady macbeth is nimmi tabu macduff is kaka piyush mishra kingdom is present day mumbai around them are indias best acting talents naseeruddin shah om puri ajay gehi this film is slightly different macbeth though macbeth is driven by his love throne maqbool is driven by his love nimmi he murders abbaji declares himself leader gang underworld is state shock everyone suspects maqbool but no one dares raise voice against him maqbool then goes murder his close friend kaka gain absolute power he is led or misled his endeavour by two corrupt cops om puri naseeruddin shah they essay role three witches macbeth performances are high order pankaj kapur delivers his career best performance followed closely by tabu fact it is photo finish vishal bhardwaj is great storyteller he imbues film with number sparkling sequences dialogues bhardwaj writer abbas tyrewala do not resort gimmicks instead have been as realistic as possible guilt pangs that nimmi maqbool suffer after abbajis murder is one phase that takes film different high altogether end all i can say is maqbool has potential be landmark film bollywood spite its shabby marketing,0.6119696969696968,0.19939393939393943,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.4}"
8.0,Irfan is the next superstar,"Irfan shines and shines. Tabu, Pankaj Kapoor are excellent, as are Naseerudin and Om Puri, but when Maqbool (Irfan) is on screen, he overshadows all. Yes even Pankaj (one of the finest actors of India). Vishal Bharadwaj has made an excellent adaptation. Why, oh why doesn't someone drag Sanjay Leela Bhansali to see this film. Anyone who has seen Irfan in 'The Warrior"" or Haasil will certify that Irfan's utterly unconventional looks acts as a force multiplier, rather than a drag. He is a great talent, and Indian filmmakers would do well to use him much more than he is being used. Another victory for Bobby Bedi, one wonders why everyone in the industry seems to hate the man. He has already given us Bandit Queen and Maqbool. What more does a man have to do? Oh that's right, ""Indian public wants films like Black and KKKG"" (actual quote by a BB basher).

6.0,Engrossing Film,"Irfan Khan made his presence felt in a little known movie called ""Haasil"". This guy, has incredible screen presence but he is probabley overshadowed by Pankaj Kapoor, who is just superb as Abbaji. He reminds me of Brando in ""Godfather"" albeit, he is not smothering a kitten! The two stelwarts, Puri and Shah, have plain fun working together, I wouldn't be surprised if they just improvised as they went along. The guy to watch is Abbas Tyrewala who is making great strides in script-writing. He has flair for comedy that very few have in the Industry. The problem with Irfan Khan is that he is better in good speaking part as in ""Haasil"". Here he is let down.

,"Middle-of-the-road Shakespeare adaptation, but one of the better updated ones","""Maqbool"" is one of those rare films which I just didn't warm to in spite of its quality. The writing is good, it's a solid, sometimes surprising adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" to modern day India. Among the updated Shakespeare films it's definitely one of the best. The dialogue is good and the script is generally strong, if a little short on quality characterization. Vishal Bharadwaj's direction is simple yet assured, confident at all times and never very clunky. The acting is uniformly excellent, and Irfan Khan is great as Maqbool (Macbeth).Still, ""Maqbool"" just wasn't a film I enjoyed very much at all. I'm sure I'll eventually come to understand why, but right now I think it's just the setting. Too often ""Maqbool"" feels like a moderately well-written crime drama, losing the intensity of Shakespeare's text, which shouldn't have been too hard to translate. The music is excellent as well, and helps set the mood, but ""Maqbool"" just never really gets going. There's drama and all, but instead of brimming with fiery intensity like Shakespeare's text or my favorite adaptation of it, Akira Kurosawa's phenomenal ""Throne of Blood"", it's all surprisingly mundane.All in all this is a middle-of-the-road Shakespseare adaptation, interestingly done and if you want to see Naserrudin Shah play a witch this is the place to do so, but overall the film never really reaches its true potential, and remains just 'good' throughout.

The important themes of blood and evil are kept very intact. From the very beginning of the movie, when the corrupt cops shoot the lad and blood splatters over the part that signifies Bombay on the diagram drawn by Pandit, showing that Bombay is going to be covered in blood, the theme is made evident.

9.0,"Very inventive re-thinking of ""Macbeth""","Intelligent and inventive updating of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" to the culture of the modern Indian underworld in Mumbai. Director Vishal Bhardwaj and screenwriter Abbas Tryewala walk the tightrope between fidelity to the original and inventiveness rarely making a misstep. Indeed, you don't have to have any knowledge of ""Macbeth"" to appreciate ""Maqbool"" as a well above average gangland film, filled with interesting characters, and tons of politics, violence, alliances and deals made and broken. The acting is generally excellent. Pankaj Kapur practically steals the film with his performance as Maqbool's boss, a savvy mob leader who has kept power not only through fear, but through inspiring loyalty and even love from not only those around him, but from 'the people' as well, by standing up for India's many minorities, who in turn elect officials inclined to look the other way at mob activitiesThe film is an interesting mix of old and new for Bollywood. The style and tone is naturalistic, the performances unforced. There are echoes of ""The Godfather"". And while there are songs, there are only a few, and generally within a context where someone bursting into song actually makes sense – a wedding celebration for instance. The film does wind down a bit towards the end, but so does (for me) Shakespeare's play – the most interesting thing being Macbeth's (or Maqbool's) seduction by and rise to power, more than the seemingly inevitable consequences.

,Great acting in creepy adaptation of Macbeth,"There is terrific acting all round in this creepy low-budget adaptation of Macbeth. Vishal Bharadwaj effectively marries Shakespeare with gangster movies to make a disturbing film. Pankaj Kapoor is riveting as the aging gangster Abbaji with Irrfan Khan playing his trusted right hand man Maqbool. Tabu has a complex role to play as Nimmi, Abbaji's moll. Her role differs from the text and she has (MINOR SPOILERS) a heart-breaking demise. Despite the crimes committed by Maqbool and Nimmi, we still feel for them both. Om Puri is in top form as a corrupt cop. Highly recommended.Overall 9/10",great acting creepy adaptation macbeth,there is terrific acting all round this creepy low budget adaptation macbeth vishal bharadwaj effectively marries shakespeare with gangster movies make disturbing film pankaj kapoor is riveting as aging gangster abbaji with irrfan khan playing his trusted right hand man maqbool tabu has complex role play as nimmi abbajis moll her role differs text she has minor spoilers heart breaking demise despite crimes committed by maqbool nimmi we still feel them both om puri is top form as corrupt cop highly recommended overall 9 10,0.568095238095238,0.016428571428571428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.04, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,A Toxic Brew,"For folks not familiar with the story of Macbeth (erm, me), this Bollywood adaptation most certainly make an interesting introduction. Questions abound for well-read folks or Shakespeare nuts; Was the film faithful to its source? Or was it bursting with invention? Is it just me or does anyone agree that the spiralling descent of this story gave off some pretty foul and nasty vibes? Maqbool's eerie, unnerving, frustrating and extremely feel bad elements all seem to crescendo into an oppressing tumult of feelings. There's also a foreboding sense of omnipresent evil in this flick's universe. An evil which takes corporeal form (instigating bitches), or not (Maqbool's own weakness of mind). An evil which plants seeds of doubts in our main man, fans his darkest desires and ultimately, pushing him towards his inevitable fall from grace. Gosh, negative energies premeate every inch of this doom enshrouded yarn....its very suffocating. That said, a well made film Maqbool is (or I would not feel the way I do now already).",toxic brew,folks not familiar with story macbeth erm me this bollywood adaptation most certainly make interesting introduction questions abound well read folks or shakespeare nuts was film faithful its source or was it bursting with invention is it just me or does anyone agree that spiralling descent this story gave off some pretty foul nasty vibes maqbools eerie unnerving frustrating extremely feel bad elements all seem crescendo into oppressing tumult feelings theres also foreboding sense omnipresent evil this flicks universe evil which takes corporeal form instigating bitches or not maqbools own weakness mind evil which plants seeds doubts our main man fans his darkest desires ultimately pushing him towards his inevitable fall grace gosh negative energies premeate every inch this doom enshrouded yarn its very suffocating that said well made film maqbool is or i would not feel way i do now already,0.7610714285714286,-0.23657738095238093,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.26}"

There are acting legends in various roles in the film, but one star outshines them all. Irrfan Khan is absolutely perfect in this. The pathos, the pain, the ambition, everything is played to perfection. This man knew his stuff, and it is tragic to think that he isn't going to be in movies anymore.

9.0,Best contemporary mainstream Indian movie,Fascinating movie. A perfect adaptation. Since I saw the Indian adaptation before the Scottish original; it actually made me appreciate how seamlessly the story has been adapted. Pankaj Kapur as Abbaji is sensational. Note his expression when he is stopped and told that the cops are waiting for him after his arrest warrant is issued. He controls his anger and sense of injustice with humor. A classic moment. Also his revenge in the police station is well written. Full marks to Vishal for the screenplay. The casting is superb and the best example of getting a consolidated cast absolutely right. Irfaan as Mia gives a steady performance but this helps the surrounding cast to shine. Tabu is first rate. So is Om Puri. And watch for the characterization of Abbaji's silent right hand man. His devotion to Abbaji and then to Allah (watch his movements first to the song being played at Eid and then when he is asked to consume alcohol) comes across very real. As real as it gets . I am a big fan of this movie and VB to me is a sensational directorial find.,best contemporary mainstream indian movie,fascinating movie perfect adaptation since i saw indian adaptation before scottish original it actually made me appreciate how seamlessly story has been adapted pankaj kapur as abbaji is sensational note his expression when he is stopped told that cops are waiting him after his arrest warrant is issued he controls his anger sense injustice with humor classic moment also his revenge police station is well written full marks vishal screenplay casting is superb best example getting consolidated cast absolutely right irfaan as mia gives steady performance but this helps surrounding cast shine tabu is first rate so is om puri watch characterization abbajis silent right hand man his devotion abbaji then allah watch his movements first song being played at eid then when he is asked consume alcohol comes across very real as real as it gets i am big fan this movie vb me is sensational directorial find,0.4219461697722567,0.34694616977225673,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8.0,"Dark, Tall and Handsome !","The movie is dark, but it towers above the rest of Bollywood and surely beautiful! Vishal Bharadwaj's direction is top-notch.Pankaj Kapur is brilliant as ever. Its pretty sad when you see him doing silly roles on TV. The way he has sunk Abbaji character into himself is truly amazing! A very powerful presence.Irfan Khan is impressive.Tabu shines ! She is by far the only one that comes to mind (in Bollywood) who combines beauty and brain! An acting prowess in the likes of Shabana Azmi added with glamour! A very rare combination indeed. I wish the directors take more advantage of this explosive combination and create some masterpieces in coming years.Music: I cannot fall short of praise for Vishal Bharadwaj for his multi faceted persona, a producer-director-writer-musiccomposer : where do you see so much rolled into one? Maachis music still echoes in my ear. A true gem in Bollywood.In Maqbool, Sultan Khan's voice has been used so beautifully. His voice is just intoxicating. 'Dheemo Re' is beautiful. The song 'Jhin Minni' has some signature style of Rehman. Few other songs like Chingari display a nice collage of western instrumentation and Indian classical infused vocals.Gulzar's screenplay is excellent. Cinematography is above avg (could be better). Naseerudding Shah and Om Puri have done perfect justice to the little roles they were given.There are some scenes that will make you cringe!
