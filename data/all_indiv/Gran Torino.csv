,Yet another Eastwood gem,"I feel like I should let everyone reading this know of my inherent bias in favor of this film. I have seen twenty eight films from Clint Eastwood as director and have liked the vast majority of them, and loved a good number of them (my average rating for the 28 films is 7.9). Still, something felt off about ""Gran Torino"" based on the trailer. I read it as Eastwood trying to be 'badass' again, trying to be Dirty Harry again. ""Gran Torino"" is not that. Walt Kowalski may have similarities with Dirty Harry, and could possibly be read as a significantly older version of Harry (it's a stretch), but he is a distinctive, memorable character on his own, and I'd go as far as saying that it's one of Eastwood's finest performances, and one which gives him a chance to show off his dramatic and comedic chops.I'm not going to argue that ""Gran Torino"" has perfect acting from the younger supporting cast. It doesn't. In fact, some of them are downright bad at times, but the film works in spite of its flaws. This screenplay was probably written with Eastwood in mind (I am not sure of the behind-the-scenes details on this) and it shows. He captures Kowalski perfectly. The film is surprisingly humorous, something that isn't being captured well enough in advertising. It's absolutely hilarious at times (watch as Kowalski attempts to make a man out of Thao by teaching him how to talk like men do), and Eastwood handles the shifts in tone brilliantly. When the film takes a dark turn towards the end I sat on the edge of my seat in suspense, fully aware of where it was heading but still mesmerized by Eastwood's tour-de-force direction. This is an artist at his prime as an actor and as a director.Whether or not ""Gran Torino"" will hold up as one of Eastwood's great films remains to be seen, and the film feels like it would be good for multiple viewings. The characterization is strong and not simplistic at all, you could argue that Kowalski is just another grouchy war vet, but Eastwood's beautiful, nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches in the screenplay (particularly towards the end) which I won't discuss in detail to avoid spoiling anything (and it's really fun to watch this movie unfold, Eastwood keeps the film moving at a wonderfully involving pace) would prove you wrong. The film works on yet another level as a deconstruction of Eastwood's image. I don't mean that as a negative, it just adds to the film's strength as a character study.It's a more intimate film than Eastwood's other film this year, ""Changeling"", and also on a smaller scale than many of his other films, but it's just as ambitious in many ways. This is not a politically correct film about a grouchy old racist suddenly turning into the most tolerant person around, it is a film about a man who, near the end of his life, is forced to confront his demons, and on the sunnier side about a man who finds true friendship where he least expected it. By the end of ""Gran Torino"" I had forgiven any flaws it might have, and was completely satisfied with the film, which far exceeded my expectations. I have a feeling that ""Gran Torino"", which has already been met with strongly positive reviews (but is still being described as a 'minor' Eastwood film by some), will eventually become an especially important part of Eastwood's filmography.",yet another eastwood gem,i feel like i should let everyone reading this know my inherent bias favor this film i have seen twenty eight films clint eastwood as director have liked vast majority them loved good number them my average rating 28 films is 7 9 still something felt off about gran torino based trailer i read it as eastwood trying be badass again trying be dirty harry again gran torino is not that walt kowalski may have similarities with dirty harry could possibly be read as significantly older version harry its stretch but he is distinctive memorable character his own id go as far as saying that its one eastwoods finest performances one which gives him chance show off his dramatic comedic chops im not going argue that gran torino has perfect acting younger supporting cast it doesnt fact some them are downright bad at times but film works spite its flaws this screenplay was probably written with eastwood mind i am not sure behind scenes details this it shows he captures kowalski perfectly film is surprisingly humorous something that isnt being captured well enough advertising its absolutely hilarious at times watch as kowalski attempts make man out thao by teaching him how talk like men do eastwood handles shifts tone brilliantly when film takes dark turn towards end i sat edge my seat suspense fully aware where it was heading but still mesmerized by eastwoods tour de force direction this is artist at his prime as actor as director whether or not gran torino will hold up as one eastwoods great films remains be seen film feels like it would be good multiple viewings characterization is strong not simplistic at all you could argue that kowalski is just another grouchy war vet but eastwoods beautiful nuanced performance as well as some neat little touches screenplay particularly towards end which i wont discuss detail avoid spoiling anything its really fun watch this movie unfold eastwood keeps film moving at wonderfully involving pace would prove you wrong film works yet another level as deconstruction eastwoods image i dont mean that as negative it just adds films strength as character study its more intimate film than eastwoods other film this year changeling also smaller scale than many his other films but its just as ambitious many ways this is not politically correct film about grouchy old racist suddenly turning into most tolerant person around it is film about man who near end his life is forced confront his demons sunnier side about man who finds true friendship where he least expected it by end gran torino i had forgiven any flaws it might have was completely satisfied with film which far exceeded my expectations i have feeling that gran torino which has already been met with strongly positive reviews but is still being described as minor eastwood film by some will eventually become especially important part eastwoods filmography,0.6062662919517758,0.18242913000977512,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
9.0,Gran Torino,"Clint Eastwood is simply great both in front of and behind the camera.Eastwood is as great as Walt Kowalski, a man who, behind his rough exterior, deeply feels the world around him. Through humor and deep emotions, this film shows us that people are complicated and life is unpredictable.Such films are rare, and nowadays they are almost non-existent. The development of the main character and the depiction of his emotions and internal conflict are interesting, which is exactly the basis of the film.There is also a bit of humor in the film, located exactly where it should be and thus creates that necessary balance against the cruel reality.The script is brilliant, and Clint Eastwood turned it into a great film, managing to evoke tension and feelings, as well as the inner struggle of the characters.The film is superbly directed and easily guides the viewer through the story. The cinematography is excellent, as is the photography. The soundtrack fits perfectly into the atmosphere of the film.This is an old-fashioned drama with interesting characters that are not one-dimensional but complicated and layered. Unfortunately, the actor who plays the character of Thao is simply not a good actor, but the rest of the cast played their parts excellently.I was particularly impressed by Ahney Her in the role of Sue, and Clint Eastwood is equally excellent in the role of Walt Kowalski. Also, Christopher Carley excellently portrayed the character of Father Janovich, a young and somewhat naive priest, whose character is also interesting and develops throughout the film.A great, powerful and inspiring film.",gran torino,clint eastwood is simply great both front behind camera eastwood is as great as walt kowalski man who behind his rough exterior deeply feels world around him through humor deep emotions this film shows us that people are complicated life is unpredictable such films are rare nowadays they are almost non existent development main character depiction his emotions internal conflict are interesting which is exactly basis film there is also bit humor film located exactly where it should be thus creates that necessary balance against cruel reality script is brilliant clint eastwood turned it into great film managing evoke tension feelings as well as inner struggle characters film is superbly directed easily guides viewer through story cinematography is excellent as is photography soundtrack fits perfectly into atmosphere film this is old fashioned drama with interesting characters that are not one dimensional but complicated layered unfortunately actor who plays character thao is simply not good actor but rest cast played their parts excellently i was particularly impressed by ahney her role sue clint eastwood is equally excellent role walt kowalski also christopher carley excellently portrayed character father janovich young somewhat naive priest whose character is also interesting develops throughout film great powerful inspiring film,0.7133333333333334,0.26958333333333334,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.32, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.09, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Clint Eastwood shows you why he still should be in FRONT of the camera,"With his performance Eastwood shows you why people like himself, Jack Nicholson, or Paul Newman only come around once in a lifetime. Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence, and he's pure dynamite in ""Gran Torino"". Perhaps the poor box office results of ""hollywoody"" movies like Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, caused Eastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material to work with as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"", he's as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy we've all had on our blocks with the garbage door open, the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes, but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. I'm not going to give the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hard-nosed tough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge, you'll love this movie!!",clint eastwood shows you why he still should be front camera,with his performance eastwood shows you why people like himself jack nicholson or paul newman only come around once lifetime though eastwood would rather focus directing he can still carry movie with his screen presence hes pure dynamite gran torino perhaps poor box office results hollywoody movies like absolute power true crime space cowboys blood work caused eastwood shy away acting but given cutting edge material work with as million dollar baby gran torino hes as good as ever his character as racist salty war vet makes you think that old guy weve all had our blocks with garbage door open million tools hanging everywhere always fixing or building something i found myself not wanting movie end because scenes between himself various hmong characters where priceless there may be complaints over racist remarks scenes but eastwood pulls it off way real person like that would talk or act point where it ends up being lighthearted im not going give plot away but if you like your clint eastwood as hard nosed tough guy with foul language alla dirty harry or heartbreak ridge youll love this movie,0.6069444444444445,0.02687389770723104,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.12, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"
9.0,Clint's best performance since Million Dollar Baby,"I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews, I was looking forward to it. After seeing it, I realized what people were excited about, it was Clint's performance, this is a man you do not want to mess with. He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance. I love his growls, he sounds like a great guard dog, I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise. I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is: he's a writer, director, and an actor, not to mention that he's great at all three of them. He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down, he's truly a good man.Walt Kowalski, a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran, lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants. At the start of the movie, Walt is attending his wife's funeral, bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich. Similarly, he has little patience with his two sons, Mitch and Steve, and their families, who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother. Walt's sons see him as ""always disappointed"" with them and their families, unaware of their obnoxiousness. Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors, a shy Thao Vang Lor and his feisty sister Sue, live with their widowed mother and grandmother. The Hmong gang, at that point, tries to persuade Thao to join them. Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Gran Torino Sport. Walt interrupts the robbery, pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee. After a few days, Spider and his gang return. With Sue at his side, Thao manages to verbally confront them to no avail. The gang drags Thao off his porch in an attempt to assault him. His family tries desperately to fend off Spider and his cohorts. The conflict ends when Walt, who fought in the United States Army's 1st Cavalry Division, threatens the gang members with his M1 Garand rifle and orders them to get off his lawn. They leave the neighborhood, telling Walt to watch his back.After seeing Sue being harassed by three black teenagers, while her ""date"" cannot help her, Walt steps in to rescue her, confronting the teenagers and threatening them with a pistol. Sue gets to know Walt, and invites him to a family barbecue on his birthday, bringing him closer to her family, explaining Hmong culture and that during the Vietnam War they fought on ""his"" side. Sue, Thao, and their mother visit Walt the next day, with Thao's family forcing him to work for Walt for a week to atone for his attempted theft of the Gran Torino. Walt has Thao clean up the neighborhood until his debt is paid and shows Thao the ways of American men. Meanwhile, the Hmong gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them. But when he refuses, the Hmong gang goes too far in getting their revenge leading to Walt wanting more than punishment, he wants justice.I highly recommend Gran Torino if you get the chance to see it, it has terrific performances and a touching story. I'm really surprised that Clint didn't get more recognition for his strength in Walt, he became that character and I loved how he protected the family that he once hated. It was wonderful to see all these characters develop and grow together, they had great chemistry and made this movie into a great one. I think down the line, Gran Torino is going to be considered a classic, this is a terrific movie and deserves it's praise.9/10",clints best performance since million dollar baby,i saw gran torino opening weekend after hearing rave reviews i was looking forward it after seeing it i realized what people were excited about it was clints performance this is man you do not want mess with hes perfect good guy with bad guys lust vengeance i love his growls he sounds like great guard dog i would love just have him by my door if salesman comes by make that noise i cant believe what triple threat clint is hes writer director actor not mention that hes great at all three them he presents gran torino with grace style old man that society has forgotten about because his bad mood not realizing that deep down hes truly good man walt kowalski retired polish american ford automobile assembly line worker korean war veteran lives with his dog daisy changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants at start movie walt is attending his wifes funeral bristling at shallow eulogy young father janovich similarly he has little patience with his two sons mitch steve their families who show little regard walts grief or memory their dead mother walts sons see him as always disappointed with them their families unaware their obnoxiousness walts teenage hmong neighbors shy thao vang lor his feisty sister sue live with their widowed mother grandmother hmong gang at that point tries persuade thao join them thaos initiation is steal walts prized car 1972 gran torino sport walt interrupts robbery pointing rifle thaos face forcing him flee after few days spider his gang return with sue at his side thao manages verbally confront them no avail gang drags thao off his porch attempt assault him his family tries desperately fend off spider his cohorts conflict ends when walt who fought united states armys 1st cavalry division threatens gang members with his m1 garand rifle orders them get off his lawn they leave neighborhood telling walt watch his back after seeing sue being harassed by three black teenagers while her date cannot help her walt steps rescue her confronting teenagers threatening them with pistol sue gets know walt invites him family barbecue his birthday bringing him closer her family explaining hmong culture that during vietnam war they fought his side sue thao their mother visit walt next day with thaos family forcing him work walt week atone his attempted theft gran torino walt has thao clean up neighborhood until his debt is paid shows thao ways american men meanwhile hmong gang keeps pressuring thao join them but when he refuses hmong gang goes too far getting their revenge leading walt wanting more than punishment he wants justice i highly recommend gran torino if you get chance see it it has terrific performances touching story im really surprised that clint didnt get more recognition his strength walt he became that character i loved how he protected family that he once hated it was wonderful see all these characters develop grow together they had great chemistry made this movie into great one i think down line gran torino is going be considered classic this is terrific movie deserves its praise 9 10,0.5004835390946503,0.1054367751589974,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,Eastwood excels at storytelling,"Gran Torino - They don't make them like they used to....Mr. Eastwood has a knack for storytelling. Instead of being preachy or having an all to obvious agenda, he lets his viewers make up their own minds. His characters don't have a message, they have a life and make no excuses for who they are. In so many subtle and intelligent ways we are allowed to make our own choices. Like with Kowalski in the movie, you are not confronted with a role model hammering home all those ""life's important messages"", but rather with a movie saying ""Look! This is the way it worked out for me. And I think I know a few tricks that might help you, but in the end it's your own life. However, you have to trust me when I say that there are a some things you don't want to see or experience!"". Some people will leave this movie entirely untouched, others will certainly be crying their guts out. Not because some people ""get it"" and others ""don't"", but because it is a brilliant piece of entertainment reaching out to every viewer in its own specific way.Eastwood's acting is top notch again, although the years have not been very kind to his voice. The rest of the cast are fine, but one can certainly spot their more amateurish backgrounds here and there which is the main reason why I could not give this one a 10/10.Apart from that there is little to criticize. It's not an action movie, not a drama movie and certainly not a comedy (even though you get a few laughs out of this one). It's simply a good story about life.....and death.",eastwood excels at storytelling,gran torino they dont make them like they used mr eastwood has knack storytelling instead being preachy or having all obvious agenda he lets his viewers make up their own minds his characters dont have message they have life make no excuses who they are so many subtle intelligent ways we are allowed make our own choices like with kowalski movie you are not confronted with role model hammering home all those lifes important messages but rather with movie saying look this is way it worked out me i think i know few tricks that might help you but end its your own life however you have trust me when i say that there are some things you dont want see or experience some people will leave this movie entirely untouched others will certainly be crying their guts out not because some people get it others dont but because it is brilliant piece entertainment reaching out every viewer its own specific way eastwoods acting is top notch again although years have not been very kind his voice rest cast are fine but one can certainly spot their more amateurish backgrounds here there which is main reason why i could not give this one 10 10 apart that there is little criticize its not action movie not drama movie certainly not comedy even though you get few laughs out this one its simply good story about life death,0.5795068027210883,0.2285586734693878,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
10.0,"Another top-notch, Clint Eastwood film that entertains and teaches.","Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times: ""Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ""Gran Torino,"" not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls."" More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal, who comments: ""No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more, and more's the pity. This one, with Clint Eastwood as director and star, is concerned with honor and atonement, with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art, takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates, revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls, glowers, mutters, growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime."" Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that ""it's clearly a career-capping work."" Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie ""is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he sounds as if he means it.""There are at least four reason why I like this film: 1. Clint Eastwood shows that the character he is playing is willing to serve in a war-- and die if necessary--to preserve freedom (and he has a medal to prove it), 2. he has grown old and the whole world has changed (and everyone around him seems to indicate--in one way or another--that he is no appreciated or needed), 3. even with a transformation, he demonstrates that people tend to be reactive--rather than responsive--and are slow to change (this is particularly true with bias, discrimination, and prejudice), and 4. that tolerance can lead to understanding (he tries to give tough love, but he becomes softer in his response--instead of his reaction--after giving and receiving genuine love). It seems that everyone around him wants his Gran Torino and everything else he owns, before he even has died, instead of being interested in him. He lives in a community that is transformation, and he knows absolutely nothing about culture, diversity, ethnicity, race, or sexual orientation. He does know about aging, however (if nowhere else, he learns about it from people's adverse and negative reactions, everywhere around him). He isn't exactly treated with dignity and respect, so why should he treat anyone else with dignity and respect? And, trust must be earned.If this is Clint Eastwood's last film, I can only say that that his performance, in this stunning film, is what legends are made of. There are some wonderful performances in ""Milk"" (Sean Penn), ""Australia"" (Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman), ""Changeling"" (Angelina Jolie and director Clint Eastwood), and ""The Dark Knight"" (a riveting performance by ""Brokeback Mountain's"" Heath Ledger). In viewing all of these films, there are performances that are not only superb, but they evoke every one of the emotions and carry the intellect and intelligence of human cognitions to the highest pinnacle of excellence. As a gay person, I must say that I am moved by Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk, I am moved by the romantic chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, and I would be remiss if I did not mention Angelina Jolie's flawless and moving performance. But, I give the top honor to Clint Eastwood for giving us films that educate and entertain. And, ""Gran Torino"" (2008) is no exception. One cannot walk away from a Clint Eastwood film, without saying that they haven't learned something, or without saying (just like the legendary Ethel Merman used to sing) 'there's no business (quite) like show business'. I rank ""Gran Torino"" (2008) a 10 out of 10. Clint Eastwood's performance is more than another version of 'Dirty Harry'. In fact, his portrayal is reminiscent of the Paul Newman character in ""Nobody's Perfect"".",another top notch clint eastwood film that entertains teaches,manohla dargis writes new york times dirty harry is back way gran torino not as character but as ghostly presence he hovers film its themes high caliber imagery course most obviously mr eastwoods face it is monumental face now so puckered pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered as it has decades but seems closer petrified wood words like flinty steely come mind adjectives that mr eastwood expressively embodies with his usual lack fuss number growls more praise eastwood comes joe morgenstern wall street journal who comments no one makes movies like gran torino any more mores pity this one with clint eastwood as director star is concerned with honor atonement with rough justice family man it raises irascibility level folk art takes unapologetic time outs unfashionable moral debates revives acting conventions that havent been fashion half century keeps you watching every frame as mr eastwood snarls glowers mutters growls grins his way through performance lifetime elizabeth weitzman new york daily news remarks that its clearly career capping work kenneth turan los angeles times writes that movie is impossible imagine without actor title role notion 78 year old action hero may sound like contradiction terms but eastwood brings it off even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical even at 78 eastwood can make get off my lawn sound as menacing as make my day when he says i blow hole your face sleep like baby he sounds as if he means it there are at least four reason why i like this film 1 clint eastwood shows that character he is playing is willing serve war die if necessary preserve freedom he has medal prove it 2 he has grown old whole world has changed everyone around him seems indicate one way or another that he is no appreciated or needed 3 even with transformation he demonstrates that people tend be reactive rather than responsive are slow change this is particularly true with bias discrimination prejudice 4 that tolerance can lead understanding he tries give tough love but he becomes softer his response instead his reaction after giving receiving genuine love it seems that everyone around him wants his gran torino everything else he owns before he even has died instead being interested him he lives community that is transformation he knows absolutely nothing about culture diversity ethnicity race or sexual orientation he does know about aging however if nowhere else he learns about it peoples adverse negative reactions everywhere around him he isnt exactly treated with dignity respect so why should he treat anyone else with dignity respect trust must be earned if this is clint eastwoods last film i can only say that that his performance this stunning film is what legends are made there are some wonderful performances milk sean penn australia hugh jackman nicole kidman changeling angelina jolie director clint eastwood dark knight riveting performance by brokeback mountains heath ledger viewing all these films there are performances that are not only superb but they evoke every one emotions carry intellect intelligence human cognitions highest pinnacle excellence as gay person i must say that i am moved by sean penns portrayal harvey milk i am moved by romantic chemistry between hugh jackman nicole kidman i would be remiss if i did not mention angelina jolies flawless moving performance but i give top honor clint eastwood giving us films that educate entertain gran torino 2008 is no exception one cannot walk away clint eastwood film without saying that they havent learned something or without saying just like legendary ethel merman used sing theres no business quite like show business i rank gran torino 2008 10 out 10 clint eastwoods performance is more than another version dirty harry fact his portrayal is reminiscent paul newman character nobodys perfect,0.5304335563426472,0.13980563207835933,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"
9.0,Sour Humour and Pure Badassery,"If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood's long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.You know that a movie has something going for it when it can a) pack in so many one-liners you can't bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain, b) be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c) make a pure, grit- and-nails, grimacing anti-hero, one man army out of a seventy-eight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood's direction and line delivery as a diamond-hard antisocial veteran is bang-on, but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play, so to speak.Following the death of his wife, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out, but Walt's less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) of the local church at the request of his late wife to 'keep an eye on him', but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience; about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family's youngest son Thao (Bee Vang) begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation, Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) befriend Walt in a way, and for a reason none can truly explain.All of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link, the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict, but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door.

9.0,This unusual Eastwood drama turns out to be one of his very best films,"Once rumoured to be another film in the DIRTY HARRY saga, GRAN TORINO is actually much, much more than a crime film. It's not even an action film, or a thriller, despite containing elements from those genres: in actual fact, it's a solid human drama about human relationships, along with ruminations on plenty of issues affecting today's world: immigration, integration into society, crime, violence, friendship, life and death, regret. I can't imagine anyone but Clint Eastwood starring in this film. Eastwood plays his usual character, except older, more frail than more; perhaps the word I'm thinking of is 'more human'. Whatever, he's absolutely astounding in this film, giving a brilliant performance as Walt Kowalski, a foul-mouthed, irritable old racist who gradually uncovers his humanity as the story progresses.Eastwood surrounds himself with a cast of unknowns, and these actors are also triumphant. Bee Vang, as Thao, Eastwood's initial enemy and then friend, has to be singled out as giving one of the best turns, and he's matched by Ahney Her who plays his sister, Sue. I loved the performances of these two actors, who successfully manage to hold their own against Clint.GRAN TORINO is a film firmly rooted in reality, which is why there are no gung-ho heroics here, no scenes of grandeur. The ending is particularly true to life, a neat twist that defies audience expectations. The script is sparkling and witty, never losing focus of the main themes, and also particularly moving without being sentimental. It's a difficult line to walk, but this film manages it. In all, a delight and one of the best Eastwood movies I've watched. This one's a keeper.",this unusual eastwood drama turns out be one his very best films,once rumoured be another film dirty harry saga gran torino is actually much much more than crime film its not even action film or thriller despite containing elements those genres actual fact its solid human drama about human relationships along with ruminations plenty issues affecting todays world immigration integration into society crime violence friendship life death regret i cant imagine anyone but clint eastwood starring this film eastwood plays his usual character except older more frail than more perhaps word im thinking is more human whatever hes absolutely astounding this film giving brilliant performance as walt kowalski foul mouthed irritable old racist who gradually uncovers his humanity as story progresses eastwood surrounds himself with cast unknowns these actors are also triumphant bee vang as thao eastwoods initial enemy then friend has be singled out as giving one best turns hes matched by ahney her who plays his sister sue i loved performances these two actors who successfully manage hold their own against clint gran torino is film firmly rooted reality which is why there are no gung ho heroics here no scenes grandeur ending is particularly true life neat twist that defies audience expectations script is sparkling witty never losing focus main themes also particularly moving without being sentimental its difficult line walk but this film manages it all delight one best eastwood movies ive watched this ones keeper,0.5045161290322582,0.2741935483870967,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,Great whether in front or behind the camera.,"Hot on the heels of 'Changeling' Eastwood is back and as well as directing he is back in front of the camera. He plays Walt Kowalski a recently widowed ex-Vietnam veteran who harbours slight racism and bitterness which isn't helped by the changing world he now lives in alone. He has relatives but they only seem to call when they want something and his grandkids have already started deciding what they will have of his when he dies. He has a few mates he drinks with in the pub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun by immigrants and gang warfare. Walt's next door neighbours are a Hmong family with no father figure and after the son tries to steal his prize car, the 'Grand Torino' of the title, Walt decides to try and reform the boy and hopefully as time passes learn about their culture and change his mind before he dies. As with all Eastwood films where you begin isn't where you will end up and the story takes many turns that will test all of your emotions, I laughed, I cried and I got angry it's a real roller-coaster. But its Clint's aged 'Dirty Harry' in Walt that steals the show and anytime he is on screen he is mesmerising which means that the supporting cast members are barely noticeable. At times it plays like Lynch's 'Straight Story' with sprinkles of 'Taxi Driver' but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling, something that Clint is a dab hand at, mix that with the modern day context and you have a gripping and enthralling film. It's no wonder that so many 'best of year' lists contain this film, they should, it is that good and it proves that even at 78 Eastwood is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to movies in front or behind the camera or in the case of 'Grand Torino' both.",great whether front or behind camera,hot heels changeling eastwood is back as well as directing he is back front camera he plays walt kowalski recently widowed ex vietnam veteran who harbours slight racism bitterness which isnt helped by changing world he now lives alone he has relatives but they only seem call when they want something his grandkids have already started deciding what they will have his when he dies he has few mates he drinks with pub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun by immigrants gang warfare walts next door neighbours are hmong family with no father figure after son tries steal his prize car grand torino title walt decides try reform boy hopefully as time passes learn about their culture change his mind before he dies as with all eastwood films where you begin isnt where you will end up story takes many turns that will test all your emotions i laughed i cried i got angry its real roller coaster but its clints aged dirty harry walt that steals show anytime he is screen he is mesmerising which means that supporting cast members are barely noticeable at times it plays like lynchs straight story with sprinkles taxi driver but real beauty is old fashioned storytelling something that clint is dab hand at mix that with modern day context you have gripping enthralling film its no wonder that so many best year lists contain this film they should it is that good it proves that even at 78 eastwood is force be reckoned with when it comes movies front or behind camera or case grand torino both,0.4376262626262627,0.1472222222222222,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,One of the best movies I've seen in years,"This is a poignant, beautiful movie, maybe the best film Eastwood has ever done. The characters are fully drawn, believable, and resonate true human emotion. I at first was put off by the idea of seeing a movie about an old racist, but when I saw the numbers of people attending the screenings, I thought there must be something there, so I went to the Arclight in Hollywood, where the theater was packed. Crusty old Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, now living in run down Detroit, hates the Vietnamese immigrants that have moved next door to him. As time goes on, he gets to know them, and the bond that forms is wonderful, and spiritual. There was not a dry eye in the house when the movie ended. I won't give the ending away, but suffice it to say this is a truly wonderful story, one that you will love and tell your friends to see.

Wishing to preserve the element of surprise, I will not reveal anything by trying to analyse this great work of art. I will say this. There are similar qualities to his previous work, but I would say that both his directing and acting have reached a level of maturity comparable to that of an excellent wine. The story was compelling and, mixed with the drama was a refined touch of humour; the perfect combination for a pleasant evening.

Gran Torino was a very well made and beautifully directed movie, complete with a fitting soundtrack, a strong script with smooth enough tone shifts and a powerful message that is well conveyed and one that I think many, myself included, would identify with. The story is mostly engaging with an interesting protagonist, but there are a few moments where it is hackneyed and predictable, which is my only criticism of this movie.

9.0,Gran Torino Review,"A very good Eastwood movie, both in terms of performance and direction by the man himself. It has, I think, a great message about today's youth, the values that society used to hold, back when men used to be men, about redemption and about judging other people by the content of their character, rather than the color of their skin. The only thing I see holding down this otherwise great film, is sometimes the dialogue of the film and the stereotypes that the family of Eastwood's character plays are a little too ""on the nose"". The family, for example, filled with ungrateful people with no values whatsoever who are only interested in what will happen to Walt's possessions as soon as he dies, often seem caricatures, characters overly simplified in order for the message to come across that they are soulless creatures and to place the emphasis that Walt comes to value and grow a much better relationship with his Asian neighbors, despite all of his initial racism and prejudice towards them. But putting that aside, Gran Torino is truly a very good film, perhaps one of Eastwood's best.",gran torino review,very good eastwood movie both terms performance direction by man himself it has i think great message about todays youth values that society used hold back when men used be men about redemption about judging other people by content their character rather than color their skin only thing i see holding down this otherwise great film is sometimes dialogue film stereotypes that family eastwoods character plays are little too nose family example filled with ungrateful people with no values whatsoever who are only interested what will happen walts possessions as soon as he dies often seem caricatures characters overly simplified order message come across that they are soulless creatures place emphasis that walt comes value grow much better relationship with his asian neighbors despite all his initial racism prejudice towards them but putting that aside gran torino is truly very good film perhaps one eastwoods best,0.5264930555555556,0.3188715277777778,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"

9.0,Teaching The Work Ethic,"At the ripe old age of 78 Clint Eastwood is starting on a whole new career of playing tough old timers who are way past the day when they get the girl in their movies. Except as surrogate daughters which he's done in his past two films, four years apart though they be.In Million Dollar Baby Eastwood plays the gruff very blue collar fight manager Frank Dunn who takes on female prize fighter Hilary Swank and she becomes a surrogate daughter to him. In Gran Torino the process is somewhat reversed, Eastwood is a recently widowed retired auto worker Walt Kowalski, still living in the family home in Detroit in a rapidly changing neighborhood. In fact that neighborhood's been changing for decades, the latest influx being Asians. Despite his gruffness, his outright racism, Eastwood almost in spite of himself gets drawn into an Asian family of Hmong people and develops a father/children relationship with a brother and sister, Bee Vang and Ahney Her. He becomes closer to them than he is with his own children whom he feels have forgotten the American work ethic.Actor Clint Eastwood a veteran of over 50 years in film and television is a man who knows himself and knows the limits and changes that age and infirmity have placed upon him. As his most famous screen character so aptly remarked a man has to know his limitations. Director Clint Eastwood is nothing short of a genius in the performances he got from the two young Asian kids, both of whom were making their screen debuts and in fact from the rest of his Asian cast members, most of whom were new. Both the boy and the girl were just fabulous and so real as kids, not at all like Hollywood teen player types.And both kids face some very typical choices that all youngsters face today, especially those growing up in areas at or below the poverty line. Especially the boy who's being pressured to join a gang. Clint himself is facing old age issues, but he still mentors the kids and in the end does what a man's got to do.It took four years for actor Eastwood to reappear on the screen again. But it was worth the wait.

9.0,Clint Eastwood Closes Out His Career With A Bang,"My expectations coming in to see Gran Torino were very high and it certainly did not disappoint. Of course Clint Eastwood reputation has only gotten even better since his recent success as a director but this time it his performance that leads the way.Clint Eastwood had if not the best performance, one of the best performances this year. His performance was vivid and magical to watch. Vivid may seem like a head scratcher of a word to use but his way of displaying his maliciousness, antisocial and cynical attitude to the many people around him including his family. Yet over the course of the movie his attitude changes towards a Hmong family who are his neighbors. When one of the boys (Thao) from the neighbors' attempts to rob him of his Gran Torino, the family sends him to work for Walt (Clint Eastwood) as punishment. While Thao works for Walt, Walt begins to form a protective fatherly type bond over Thao. In this way as well Eastwood's performance is very vivid showing how his cold bitter attitude can transform into a very warm selfless demeanor towards one family.Gran Torino was also written and directed very well. Especially since a relatively unknown cast played to beyond anyone could have expected. Some how Clint Eastwood manages to continue to maximize the potential of the material he is given.This was a very heart-warming film in my mind throughout. The ending of the film is probably more of an ending to Eastwood's career as an actor rather than that of the movie itself. It does not leave him in the place he is looked at as a vigilante but rather in the place of the man that stands up for his morals and for the people he is loyal to.",clint eastwood closes out his career with bang,my expectations coming see gran torino were very high it certainly did not disappoint course clint eastwood reputation has only gotten even better since his recent success as director but this time it his performance that leads way clint eastwood had if not best performance one best performances this year his performance was vivid magical watch vivid may seem like head scratcher word use but his way displaying his maliciousness antisocial cynical attitude many people around him including his family yet over course movie his attitude changes towards hmong family who are his neighbors when one boys thao neighbors attempts rob him his gran torino family sends him work walt clint eastwood as punishment while thao works walt walt begins form protective fatherly type bond over thao this way as well eastwoods performance is very vivid showing how his cold bitter attitude can transform into very warm selfless demeanor towards one family gran torino was also written directed very well especially since relatively unknown cast played beyond anyone could have expected some how clint eastwood manages continue maximize potential material he is given this was very heart warming film my mind throughout ending film is probably more ending eastwoods career as actor rather than that movie itself it does not leave him place he is looked at as vigilante but rather place man that stands up his morals people he is loyal,0.6324704761904762,0.14592476190476192,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.58}"
10.0,Like morphing Archie Bunker with Dirty Harry...this one is full of surprises.,"The movie begins with Clint Eastwood's wife dying. You can immediately see that he's a nasty old man who has little, if any, connection with his kids and grandkids (some of which ARE pretty unlikable). He also lives in a community that is now filled with Asians and Chicanos (and gangs) and he hates them—and they don't particularly like him either. At this point, it's hard to like the crusty old guy. He's nasty to the well-meaning priest that's trying to help him cope with the wife's death and he just wants everyone to leave him alone.Later, despite Eastwood's character wanting his privacy, he is forced to get involved—though it's NOT for altruistic reasons. An Asian gang is trying to force a neighbor kid to join themby kidnapping him. Unfortunately for Eastwood, the gang is loud and come on his property and he responds by holding them at gunpoint---telling them to leave or die! Unexpectedly, the next day, his Asian neighbors begins bringing him food, flowers and other gifts. Why? Because they, too, have been terrorized by the gangs and they wanted to thank him. In addition, the teen he saved from kidnapping thanks him.and admits that he'd tried to steal Eastwood's prize old car (a Gran Torino in mint condition) the prior night. Eastwood graciously responds that if he ever sees the kid again on his property, he'll ""blow his head off""! This Eastwood character talks a lot like Archie Bunker combined with Dirty Harry---and he just wants to be left alone!! Where the film goes next is somewhat predictable, but how it all ends is simply amazing--and practically impossible to predict. I'd say more, but I really don't want to spoil the film.The film excels with its witty and very gritty dialog. However, be forewarned that the film has very, very rough language. Not only is there a lot of cursing, but the film has tons of racial epithets--so many that the strongly politically correct out there might just have a stroke if they watch it! While it is vulgar and gross, it was fitting for the story--as gang life is not pretty and sanitizing it too much would have severely impacted the film's realism.Overall, a great film with expert direction, story and acting.

,A Vintage Vehicle but Hardly a Classic,"Gran Torino is a rather one dimensional vehicle for Clint Eastwood, who has been one of my favorite actors since Rawhide. I freely admit I was disappointed by it and I don't share the general adulation of other reviewers, amateur and professional.My viewing experience was also rather strange. At 53 I'm well used to being a very unimportant part of the demographic - I 'get' that I'm not supposed to be a movie fan. That important role is left to the 18 to 30 age group. (We'll ignore that I have 2 kids in that age category who go to the movies one tenth as often as I do) So finding myself in a movie theatre full of people far older than me was a slightly unnerving experience. And I haven't shared a movie viewing with such a vocal audience since Brokeback Mountain, and, just like BBM, the audience laughed heartily. I'm still digesting quite why. Gran Torino is mildly amusing in places but really, it's not that funny. It's tragic. The genuinely hearty laughter from the 'mature' audience at all the racist jokes left me mildly bemused.Eastwood plays embittered Korean War vet, and ex Ford car plant worker Walt, who has been recently widowed. He's being patronized by a wet-behind-the-ears young priest who promised his late wife that he'd keep an eye on Walt for her. He's hung on in the old neighborhood even as it's got rougher and tougher as various migrant groups have moved in, his family are pretty much waiting for him to die so they can inherit whatever goodies there are, and, the final insult for our politically incorrect hero, a family of Asians (Hmoung) live next door. And they are not heavily into lawn care. Walt pretty much thinks an Asian is an Asian and they're all equally undesirable as neighbours, after all he fought them in a war. He's an old school racist.When the son Thao (Bee Vang) attempts  very ineptly  to steal Walt's muscle car, a '72 Ford Gran Torino, as part of a gang initiation he doesn't want to do, Walt gives him a series of chores as retribution, and a tentative father-son relationship ensues. Thao's brighter and westernised sister Sue (Ahney Her) becomes the conduit via which Walt and the neighbours start to interact. The point is somewhat labored that Walt lives alone, alternately ignored or patronized by his family who clearly find him tedious, while the Hmoung all seem to live in one big happy extended family with granny cheerfully spitting on the front porch. Walt digs out his old war weapon and chases off the gang when they harass Thao, thus becoming an unlikely neighbourhood hero. Grateful, they smother him with food and hospitality whether he wants it or not, but trouble is brewing that will eventually lead to tragedy. Alongside the story of Walt, the gang and his neighbours is the coming of age tale of the eager young priest (Christopher Carley), and Walt's failing health.So far so good. The movie isn't too badly written and its heart is in the right place. It seems a little out of date now  with the economy in freefall and construction jobs being shed faster than a Labrador's hair, I doubt Walt could really get a totally inexperienced kid a job on a building site no matter how well he knew the Irish foreman  and I found Walt's attempt to teach Thao 'manly' interaction at the barber's shop fairly excruciating  wherever these guys live it's apparently still 1957. Walt hates everyone including his own sons and grandchildren but the thought that they might have gained their family values from him never seems to occur to him.The cinematography is good with the house interiors, the neighbourhood, the yards and the church all looking genuinely authentic. But the movie sags in the middle and feels very contrived, all the characters are one dimensional and the acting is best described as adequate. If this were not Eastwood, and he were not 78, I doubt this would be scoring 8.5 out of 10 (as it is at the time of writing) on IMDb. In fact, I doubt it would have gotten made. It lacks any real bite, and is fairly predictable. It's not actively bad, but it's simply not as good as it could be or as many IMDb reviewers seem to think it is, and Eastwood is in danger of becoming a parody of himself. There is a level on which I think it appeals to the audience's basest instincts, and I'm still disquieted by all that hearty laughter from my cinema companions. But maybe it's me.",vintage vehicle but hardly classic,gran torino is rather one dimensional vehicle clint eastwood who has been one my favorite actors since rawhide i freely admit i was disappointed by it i dont share general adulation other reviewers amateur professional my viewing experience was also rather strange at 53 im well used being very unimportant part demographic i get that im not supposed be movie fan that important role is left 18 30 age group well ignore that i have 2 kids that age category who go movies one tenth as often as i do so finding myself movie theatre full people far older than me was slightly unnerving experience i havent shared movie viewing with such vocal audience since brokeback mountain just like bbm audience laughed heartily im still digesting quite why gran torino is mildly amusing places but really its not that funny its tragic genuinely hearty laughter mature audience at all racist jokes left me mildly bemused eastwood plays embittered korean war vet ex ford car plant worker walt who has been recently widowed hes being patronized by wet behind ears young priest who promised his late wife that hed keep eye walt her hes hung old neighborhood even as its got rougher tougher as various migrant groups have moved his family are pretty much waiting him die so they can inherit whatever goodies there are final insult our politically incorrect hero family asians hmoung live next door they are not heavily into lawn care walt pretty much thinks asian is asian theyre all equally undesirable as neighbours after all he fought them war hes old school racist when son thao bee vang attempts very ineptly steal walts muscle car 72 ford gran torino as part gang initiation he doesnt want do walt gives him series chores as retribution tentative father son relationship ensues thaos brighter westernised sister sue ahney her becomes conduit via which walt neighbours start interact point is somewhat labored that walt lives alone alternately ignored or patronized by his family who clearly find him tedious while hmoung all seem live one big happy extended family with granny cheerfully spitting front porch walt digs out his old war weapon chases off gang when they harass thao thus becoming unlikely neighbourhood hero grateful they smother him with food hospitality whether he wants it or not but trouble is brewing that will eventually lead tragedy alongside story walt gang his neighbours is coming age tale eager young priest christopher carley walts failing health so far so good movie isnt too badly written its heart is right place it seems little out date now with economy freefall construction jobs being shed faster than labradors hair i doubt walt could really get totally inexperienced kid job building site no matter how well he knew irish foreman i found walts attempt teach thao manly interaction at barbers shop fairly excruciating wherever these guys live its apparently still 1957 walt hates everyone including his own sons grandchildren but thought that they might have gained their family values him never seems occur him cinematography is good with house interiors neighbourhood yards church all looking genuinely authentic but movie sags middle feels very contrived all characters are one dimensional acting is best described as adequate if this were not eastwood he were not 78 i doubt this would be scoring 8 5 out 10 as it is at time writing imdb fact i doubt it would have gotten made it lacks any real bite is fairly predictable its not actively bad but its simply not as good as it could be or as many imdb reviewers seem think it is eastwood is danger becoming parody himself there is level which i think it appeals audiences basest instincts im still disquieted by all that hearty laughter my cinema companions but maybe its me,0.47826330532212885,0.10288986503692386,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
,Didn't make my day,"I am a Clint Eastwood fan, but not lately.He has decided to reveal a human side of himself - went to the Wizard and acquired a heart. He also revealed he is a wooden actor and a plodding, predictable director. Gran Torino is uninteresting at best and tedious at worst,worse even than Million Dollar Baby,and contains some of the worst actors ever subjected to the silver screen. I did enjoy the Christ-image at the end as he is sprawled on the lawn,which was an unintentional touch of humor. He says he is going to continue directing pictures and maybe next time he could hire a professional screenwriter.Speaking of directing, the Directors of the IMDb website should monitor entries more carefully.Currently, Gran Torino has an 8.5 ranking, which is a travesty.Since this puts it in with some mighty good movies,modern filmgoers obviously haven't a clue regarding what makes a good picture.Perhaps a separate category could be designated for films made after,say,1980.That might separate the film lovers from the dilettantes.",didnt make my day,i am clint eastwood fan but not lately he has decided reveal human side himself went wizard acquired heart he also revealed he is wooden actor plodding predictable director gran torino is uninteresting at best tedious at worst worse even than million dollar baby contains some worst actors ever subjected silver screen i did enjoy christ image at end as he is sprawled lawn which was unintentional touch humor he says he is going continue directing pictures maybe next time he could hire professional screenwriter speaking directing directors imdb website should monitor entries more carefully currently gran torino has 8 5 ranking which is travesty since this puts it with some mighty good movies modern filmgoers obviously havent clue regarding what makes good picture perhaps separate category could be designated films made after say 1980 that might separate film lovers dilettantes,0.505,0.0375,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.19}"
5.0,Mainly for Clint Eastwood fans,"Despite all the rave reviews, which I don't understand, I didn't think this movie was made very well. It was mainly the acting and the writing. CLint Eastwoods performance was great, but everybody else was bad. From the Young preacher to the main Hmong characters the acting was forced and you could tell that all these people had never done a movie before, which according to IMDb is mostly true.Right off the bat you saw the actor who played the preacher was of considerably less caliber than anyone else in the scenes. The Hmong actor during a climatic scene with Clint Eastwood seemed fake, forced and just not very good. Again if everybody was that bad maybe no one would have noticed but they were up against a veteran actor, so it was quite noticeable.The writing was a little empty and it didn't take a guru to see right through the plot.I know Clint Eastwoods movies are plain movies, usually low budget, with fresh new actors, and simple plot lines, with the exception of his latest WWII movies and Mystic River. Although the revenue must be very high for this movie cause I'm sure it was dirt cheap to make considering all the aspects, but this certainly isn't a must see even if it is his last acting movie.",mainly clint eastwood fans,despite all rave reviews which i dont understand i didnt think this movie was made very well it was mainly acting writing clint eastwoods performance was great but everybody else was bad young preacher main hmong characters acting was forced you could tell that all these people had never done movie before which according imdb is mostly true right off bat you saw actor who played preacher was considerably less caliber than anyone else scenes hmong actor during climatic scene with clint eastwood seemed fake forced just not very good again if everybody was that bad maybe no one would have noticed but they were up against veteran actor so it was quite noticeable writing was little empty it didnt take guru see right through plot i know clint eastwoods movies are plain movies usually low budget with fresh new actors simple plot lines with exception his latest wwii movies mystic river although revenue must be very high this movie cause im sure it was dirt cheap make considering all aspects but this certainly isnt must see even if it is his last acting movie,0.4342952811077812,0.0367415032883783,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.33, 'Fear': 0.5}"
9.0,Clint Eastwood at his very best,"Review: Clint Eastwood performs a knock-out and surely Oscar worthy performance as a disgruntled Korean War vet called Walt Kowalski. The plot, though simple in substance and style is brilliantly planned and educated. The film follows a disgruntled Korean war veteran named Walt Kowalski, who sets out to reform his neighbour, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.Whilst both electric and brilliant, Eastwood fully acts his character to the bone and it shows that this is a character that has been perfectly created by Eastwood himself. Every aspect is detailed and visually amazing. Eastwood also shows us his dramatic and comedic side to Kowalski. The direction by Eastwood is powerful and imaginative which flows as boldly as the story. The backdrop to the film is mystic and thrilling as you don't now what's going to happen next, and Eastwood has crafted this brilliantly which keeps audiences on the edge.Verdict:Never since The Outlaw Josey Wales has Eastwood portrayed a character so thrilling and as exciting as Walt Kawolski. All in all this is a powerhouse performance which should get Easttwood an Oscar and a definite Director nod.",clint eastwood at his very best,review clint eastwood performs knock out surely oscar worthy performance as disgruntled korean war vet called walt kowalski plot though simple substance style is brilliantly planned educated film follows disgruntled korean war veteran named walt kowalski who sets out reform his neighbour young hmong teenager who tried steal kowalskis prized possession his 1972 gran torino whilst both electric brilliant eastwood fully acts his character bone it shows that this is character that has been perfectly created by eastwood himself every aspect is detailed visually amazing eastwood also shows us his dramatic comedic side kowalski direction by eastwood is powerful imaginative which flows as boldly as story backdrop film is mystic thrilling as you dont now whats going happen next eastwood has crafted this brilliantly which keeps audiences edge verdict never since outlaw josey wales has eastwood portrayed character so thrilling as exciting as walt kawolski all all this is powerhouse performance which should get easttwood oscar definite director nod,0.7120332577475434,0.3920634920634921,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.39}"
1.0,A banal display of gimmickery and staggeringly amateurish acting.,"""Relax zipperhead, I'm not going to shoot you"", grumped Harry the Ole Fart to Billy the karate Kid. ""I may not be the most pleasant man that walks the Earth, you zip face, fish head, you gook...grunthhhhggghhh.....""Enough already!Seriously, this film's so bad it's not even funny. Here's the whole ordeal in a nutshell:Over the top racist old war vet is grumpy. Over the top racist old war vet is slightly less grumpy. Over the top racist old war vet develops a heart. Some injustice, unfathomable plot twist. To everyone's ill concealed embarrassment, Clint barks a tune during the credits -The end-Mix in some truly pathetic acting by a cast clearly let in on a sympathy vote, the worst clichés gathered from Alan Smithee's collective works, The Ultimate Anthology of Prosthetic Plot Points, and you get this yard sale of banality which is Gran Torino.If you like your drama spoon fed to you with a predictability factor that would even make a soap screenwriter blush and if you can stand Eastwood doing poor grizzly imitation while impersonating a fossilized plank of pre-Cambrian wood throughout an entire film, I guess this movie is for you.But if you're still going for something slightly original, convincing or otherwise entertaining , I can only recommend a dozen of other films that are actually worth their viewing. Go see 'The Usual Suspects' if you never got around to see it. 'Big Fish', 'Lost in Translation', 'Funny Games', 'Ground Hog Day', 'Michael Clayton' or 'The Escapist'. And bloody shame on all those professional movie critics. I mean, surely they must have HBO so they can compare this shameful dross to for instance 'The Wire' and conclude that which was actually really made for TV, is light years ahead of this straight- to-DVD clunker.Gran Torino, a score of 8.4 and a #85 place in the IMDb top 250 list.What a joke!4.5/10",banal display gimmickery staggeringly amateurish acting,relax zipperhead im not going shoot you grumped harry ole fart billy karate kid i may not be most pleasant man that walks earth you zip face fish head you gook grunthhhhggghhh enough already seriously this films so bad its not even funny heres whole ordeal nutshell over top racist old war vet is grumpy over top racist old war vet is slightly less grumpy over top racist old war vet develops heart some injustice unfathomable plot twist everyones ill concealed embarrassment clint barks tune during credits end mix some truly pathetic acting by cast clearly let sympathy vote worst clich s gathered alan smithees collective works ultimate anthology prosthetic plot points you get this yard sale banality which is gran torino if you like your drama spoon fed you with predictability factor that would even make soap screenwriter blush if you can stand eastwood doing poor grizzly imitation while impersonating fossilized plank pre cambrian wood throughout entire film i guess this movie is you but if youre still going something slightly original convincing or otherwise entertaining i can only recommend dozen other films that are actually worth their viewing go see usual suspects if you never got around see it big fish lost translation funny games ground hog day michael clayton or escapist bloody shame all those professional movie critics i mean surely they must have hbo so they can compare this shameful dross instance wire conclude that which was actually really made tv is light years ahead this straight dvd clunker gran torino score 8 4 place imdb top 250 list what joke 4 5 10,0.5447997416020671,0.022965116279069785,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.35}"
