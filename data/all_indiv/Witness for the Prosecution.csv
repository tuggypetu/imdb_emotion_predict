9.0,The Goal Is Always Justice,"In a recent biography of Billy Wilder, Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that this was the best adaption of her work ever done on the screen. I can't praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that.Tyrone Power in his farewell film plays Leonard Vole who befriends a dotty old widow played by Norma Varden. She even rewrites her will leaving him the bulk of a very large estate. When she's murdered, Scotland Yard arrests Power.Power's solicitor Henry Daniell retains a dream team for defense of John Williams and the recently recovered Charles Laughton. Laughton is recovering from a heart attack and against medical advice plunges into the case. Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor's advice.The original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife. Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr. and Mrs. Vole. So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957, but lost to Alec Guinness. Marlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Vole. She's a war bride over from Germany and she's got her own agenda going. Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film. Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself, but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration, the element of surprise would have been lost in the film. Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that.The Anglo-Saxon legal system's goal is justice. Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution.",goal is always justice,recent biography billy wilder agatha christie is quoted as saying that this was best adaption her work ever done screen i cant praise witness prosecution any higher than that tyrone power his farewell film plays leonard vole who befriends dotty old widow played by norma varden she even rewrites her will leaving him bulk very large estate when shes murdered scotland yard arrests power powers solicitor henry daniell retains dream team defense john williams recently recovered charles laughton laughton is recovering heart attack against medical advice plunges into case laughton also has deal with efforts his assigned nurse elsa lanchester keep him following doctors advice original play this was taken concentrated completely power character machinations his wife wilder built up character nurse barrister sir wilfred robards so that they almost equaled screen time mr mrs vole so much so that charles laughton was nominated academy award 1957 but lost alec guinness marlene dietrich plays mrs vole shes war bride over germany shes got her own agenda going her performance what her character does is key whole film dietrich probably would have gotten oscar nomination herself but due fact that if her performance was hyped up academy consideration element surprise would have been lost film wilder fact apologized marlene that anglo saxon legal systems goal is justice justice is served though not quite way it usually is witness prosecution,0.3960084033613446,0.17226890756302526,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.5}"
8.0,Another triumph for cinematic genius Billy Wilder!,"Billy Wilder is a director with an understanding of cinema that is almost unmatched throughout the medium's entire history - that's why his films are always so good. Witness for the Prosecution is yet another highlight in the great director's history, and it proves that courtroom dramas can be both riveting and a great opportunity for some first rate comedy. Wilder's film features one of the most well paced plots I've ever seen in a film, and it's a plot that includes some very finely tuned twists. Towards the end, Wilder bombards us with twist after twist, each one both making sense and topping the one before it. In a time when people are impressed by films such as 'The Sixth Sense', Billy Wilder still shows us how to skilfully attribute a twist into a film's plot. The plot itself follows the story of Sir Wilfrid Robarts; an ace defence lawyer that has been told that his health won't allow him to tackle anything more than mundane cases, but is brought back into the fray when a case involving the murder of an elderly woman comes into his hands. Wilfrid must now juggle the case and his health as he attempts to keep the young man from being sent down.Like all Wilder films, this one is a very pleasurable viewing. Wilder manages to find a middle ground between substance and entertainment, and so this is a film that will please fans of both aspects. The film is deliriously entertaining throughout, with some truly great lines of dialogue (most of which is very quotable) and every twist adds a new level to the story. The substance comes from a multitude of angles, and themes of love, health, sacrifice and most notably, justice, are all more than prevalent. The acting is certainly of note in Witness for the Prosecution. Charles Laughton is absolutely sublime as the undermining and stubborn Wilfrid Robarts; his performance is very strong, and makes up the backbone of the film. The main supporting performance comes from Marlene Dietrich. I'm not a big fan of hers; despite having a great pair of legs, she just doesn't do anything for me, but in this film she brings sufficient coldness to her character and really makes it her own. The final main performance comes from Tyrone Power; he isn't as great as the other two, but does enough with his character to ensure he's believable. Highly recommended viewing!",another triumph cinematic genius billy wilder,billy wilder is director with understanding cinema that is almost unmatched throughout mediums entire history thats why his films are always so good witness prosecution is yet another highlight great directors history it proves that courtroom dramas can be both riveting great opportunity some first rate comedy wilders film features one most well paced plots ive ever seen film its plot that includes some very finely tuned twists towards end wilder bombards us with twist after twist each one both making sense topping one before it time when people are impressed by films such as sixth sense billy wilder still shows us how skilfully attribute twist into films plot plot itself follows story sir wilfrid robarts ace defence lawyer that has been told that his health wont allow him tackle anything more than mundane cases but is brought back into fray when case involving murder elderly woman comes into his hands wilfrid must now juggle case his health as he attempts keep young man being sent down like all wilder films this one is very pleasurable viewing wilder manages find middle ground between substance entertainment so this is film that will please fans both aspects film is deliriously entertaining throughout with some truly great lines dialogue most which is very quotable every twist adds new level story substance comes multitude angles themes love health sacrifice most notably justice are all more than prevalent acting is certainly note witness prosecution charles laughton is absolutely sublime as undermining stubborn wilfrid robarts his performance is very strong makes up backbone film main supporting performance comes marlene dietrich im not big fan hers despite having great pair legs she just doesnt do anything me but this film she brings sufficient coldness her character really makes it her own final main performance comes tyrone power he isnt as great as other two but does enough with his character ensure hes believable highly recommended viewing,0.49833028699695364,0.32226134359467684,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,EntertainingTrial Movie That Still Holds Up,"This is one of the best ""trial movies"" ever made. It's an outstanding film that is just as good today as it was almost 50 years ago when it was released in the theaters. The shocking ending caused quite a stir back then, too.The only part of the movie I thought looked dated and unrealistic was Tyrone Power's character being able to interrupt the trial with outbursts and not be reprimanded for it. There is no way that would be tolerated, at least today.Otherwise, it's a pretty solid film with a good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how to entertain: Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich. Laughton, who plays Power's defense attorney, grabs the spotlight in the story but Dietrich almost steals the movie in her role as Power's wife. Laughton's dialog is terrific throughout, bringing a number of laughs to this serious film. He's just a joy to watch. Dietrich is even more riveting but just doesn't have anywhere near the same amount of screen time as Laughton.Not to be overlooked is Elsa Lanchester, playing Laughton's nurse. She, too, demonstrates her comedic talent and significantly adds to the fun of watching this film.If you like some fine drama, storyline twists, a little humor thrown in and great acting and dialog, this is a classic film to check out.",entertainingtrial movie that still holds up,this is one best trial movies ever made its outstanding film that is just as good today as it was almost 50 years ago when it was released theaters shocking ending caused quite stir back then too only part movie i thought looked dated unrealistic was tyrone powers character being able interrupt trial with outbursts not be reprimanded it there is no way that would be tolerated at least today otherwise its pretty solid film with good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how entertain charles laughton marlene dietrich laughton who plays powers defense attorney grabs spotlight story but dietrich almost steals movie her role as powers wife laughtons dialog is terrific throughout bringing number laughs this serious film hes just joy watch dietrich is even more riveting but just doesnt have anywhere near same amount screen time as laughton not be overlooked is elsa lanchester playing laughtons nurse she too demonstrates her comedic talent significantly adds fun watching this film if you like some fine drama storyline twists little humor thrown great acting dialog this is classic film check out,0.5641975308641974,0.22175925925925924,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.13, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.26}"
9.0,This had me to the bitter end!,"I love it when a movie captivates me, carries me along, then surprises me at the end. This is a masterpiece of human maneuvering. It has outstanding acting and a plot to die for. This is a fairly pedestrian Agatha Christie short story. I'm not saying it's not a wonderful story, just that it doesn't come to life like it does on the screen. Charles Laughton is the wonder barrister who is taking the case, even though he is in poor health. The murder case seems a relatively simple one until we begin to trip over the many layers left lying on the path. Marlene Dietrich does a masterful job in all her roles (I won't say anymore than that so I don't spoil the ending). Tyrone Power is able to balance his pathos and his potential guilt. The beauty of the movie is that it never takes itself too seriously. There are some modestly funny subplots and a great deal of careful investigation. I guarantee you that once you start watching, you won't be able to turn it off.",this had me bitter end,i love it when movie captivates me carries me along then surprises me at end this is masterpiece human maneuvering it has outstanding acting plot die this is fairly pedestrian agatha christie short story im not saying its not wonderful story just that it doesnt come life like it does screen charles laughton is wonder barrister who is taking case even though he is poor health murder case seems relatively simple one until we begin trip over many layers left lying path marlene dietrich does masterful job all her roles i wont say anymore than that so i dont spoil ending tyrone power is able balance his pathos his potential guilt beauty movie is that it never takes itself too seriously there are some modestly funny subplots great deal careful investigation i guarantee you that once you start watching you wont be able turn it off,0.6199404761904762,0.19083333333333335,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,Dynamite courtroom drama,"This is one of the absolute best courtroom movies ever made, along with ANATOMY OF A MURDER and THE VERDICT. All deserve a score of 10 and each is great in it own way.This film is great, but not for the realism of ANATOMY OF A MURDER. Instead, it's got such a wonderful script full of wonderful twists and turns. Plus, having top actors on the top of their game (such as Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and Marlena Dietrich) made this such a great film.

10.0,"""I suspected something, but not that. Never that!""","That's a quotation from the film and what you'll say at the conclusion. I saw it the first time 36 years ago back when network TV ran old movies late at night, and I'd never even heard of it. I thought it was a Hitchcock film with all of the unexpected twists, but no, the director was Billy Wilder. How surprised I was to see Wilder do Hitchcock better than Hitchcock ever could! The set-up is this - Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is an inventor that is having trouble getting his inventions to market. He befriends a wealthy older woman, one Emily French. She is obviously flirting with him, and Vole, though married, flirts back, his objective being that maybe she will financially back one of his inventions. Then disaster strikes. Emily French is found murdered. Vole is an obvious suspect because Mrs. French has just changed her will and left everything to Vole. There is circumstantial evidence pointing to Vole, and he says he knows nothing about the will. Enter barrister Sir Wilfred, the finest in England, whose doctor has told him he must quit work and go on a vacation because of his heart condition. Sir Wilfred talks to Vole, believes his story, and also talks to his wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich) who backs up Leonard's story but comes across as somewhat cold to her husband's peril. Sir Wilfred is convinced to take the case and agrees to retire upon this last trial. Past that I cannot tell you any details or I'll ruin it for you.Everyone in the cast performs masterfully. Especially charming is the interaction between Laughton's character and his nurse played by his wife of then 28 years, Elsa Lanchester. They go back and forth at each other with Nurse Pimsoll insisting that Sir Wilfred keep his rigid schedule of medications and him treating her like a jailer with hilarious one liners at the poor woman's expense. Only a long married couple could do this feature length banter so well. If Nightmare Alley didn't convince you that Tyrone Power was more than a pretty face, this film will. Likewise, Marlene Dietrich is much more than a blue angel and a fine figure of a woman at age 56.Notice all of the little touches. How Sir Wilfred seems to be ignoring testimony in court by counting out his pills, only to stand up and ask insightful questions when his turn comes. Plus this film really shows that nothing is off the record, even if the judge says that it is - the jury hears and sees everything. Sir Wilfred plays on that fact.Great acting, great direction, great story - it doesn't get any better than this. Thus I give this a solid 10/10. And one irony - Power's character mentions several times about Sir Wilfred's heart, but it is Tyrone Power himself who will be dead of a heart attack by the end of the following year. Sadly, this is his last completed film.",i suspected something but not that never that,thats quotation film what youll say at conclusion i saw it first time 36 years ago back when network tv ran old movies late at night id never even heard it i thought it was hitchcock film with all unexpected twists but no director was billy wilder how surprised i was see wilder do hitchcock better than hitchcock ever could set up is this leonard vole tyrone power is inventor that is having trouble getting his inventions market he befriends wealthy older woman one emily french she is obviously flirting with him vole though married flirts back his objective being that maybe she will financially back one his inventions then disaster strikes emily french is found murdered vole is obvious suspect because mrs french has just changed her will left everything vole there is circumstantial evidence pointing vole he says he knows nothing about will enter barrister sir wilfred finest england whose doctor has told him he must quit work go vacation because his heart condition sir wilfred talks vole believes his story also talks his wife christine marlene dietrich who backs up leonards story but comes across as somewhat cold her husbands peril sir wilfred is convinced take case agrees retire upon this last trial past that i cannot tell you any details or ill ruin it you everyone cast performs masterfully especially charming is interaction between laughtons character his nurse played by his wife then 28 years elsa lanchester they go back forth at each other with nurse pimsoll insisting that sir wilfred keep his rigid schedule medications him treating her like jailer with hilarious one liners at poor womans expense only long married couple could do this feature length banter so well if nightmare alley didnt convince you that tyrone power was more than pretty face this film will likewise marlene dietrich is much more than blue angel fine figure woman at age 56 notice all little touches how sir wilfred seems be ignoring testimony court by counting out his pills only stand up ask insightful questions when his turn comes plus this film really shows that nothing is off record even if judge says that it is jury hears sees everything sir wilfred plays that fact great acting great direction great story it doesnt get any better than this thus i give this solid 10 10 one irony powers character mentions several times about sir wilfreds heart but it is tyrone power himself who will be dead heart attack by end following year sadly this is his last completed film,0.4328431372549019,0.10138888888888889,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,The Mother of all Courtroom dramas/thrillers.,"Yours truly has never been much of a reader, though with one notable exception: the work of Agatha Christie. I absolutely, positively worship this brilliant woman and try to read as many of her novels, short stories and stage play adaptations as possible. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a genuine classic, and although somewhat atypical for Christie, it is undeniably one of the greatest stories ever penned down. There's one major disadvantage about having read all of Christie's whodunits, of course, namely that you can't experience the same astounding twist-in-the-end twice! I would really have loved to be overwhelmed by the climax of this film- version, especially because Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power give away such fabulous performances. The story, with its fascinating characters and dazzling plot twists, does remain the movie's biggest strongpoint, but there are a number of more reasons why ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is righteously considered as one of the most massive milestones in cinematic history. Billy Wilder's surefooted direction, for one, and the stellar performances of the entire ensemble cast. I mentioned Dietrich and Power already, but there's also the downright phenomenal Charles Laughton (arguably the most shamefully neglected actor/director in history) and an appealing supportive role for Elsa Lancaster. But do I daresay that the ultimate success-factor of this stage play adaptation is the masterful re-creation of the court trial? The bombastic settings and decors, the echoing acoustics, the powerful monologues of confident (and arrogant) barristers and the intimidating gowns and wigs are largely what make ""Witness for the Prosecution"" not only the first but also the mother of all courtroom dramas. This may just be the opinion of an avid fan, but practically ALL great courtroom-dramas that were released from the sixties until present day (""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Philadelphia"", ""Devil's Advocate"", ""A Few Good Men"") were clearly influenced by ""Witness for the Prosecution"". In fact, I only have one minor complaint: *** Spoiler **** the film version adds one more final twist that I didn't find 100% plausible.",mother all courtroom dramas thrillers,yours truly has never been much reader though with one notable exception work agatha christie i absolutely positively worship this brilliant woman try read as many her novels short stories stage play adaptations as possible witness prosecution is genuine classic although somewhat atypical christie it is undeniably one greatest stories ever penned down theres one major disadvantage about having read all christies whodunits course namely that you cant experience same astounding twist end twice i would really have loved be overwhelmed by climax this film version especially because marlene dietrich tyrone power give away such fabulous performances story with its fascinating characters dazzling plot twists does remain movies biggest strongpoint but there are number more reasons why witness prosecution is righteously considered as one most massive milestones cinematic history billy wilders surefooted direction one stellar performances entire ensemble cast i mentioned dietrich power already but theres also downright phenomenal charles laughton arguably most shamefully neglected actor director history appealing supportive role elsa lancaster but do i daresay that ultimate success factor this stage play adaptation is masterful re creation court trial bombastic settings decors echoing acoustics powerful monologues confident arrogant barristers intimidating gowns wigs are largely what make witness prosecution not only first but also mother all courtroom dramas this may just be opinion avid fan but practically all great courtroom dramas that were released sixties until present day kill mockingbird philadelphia devils advocate few good men were clearly influenced by witness prosecution fact i only have one minor complaint spoiler film version adds one more final twist that i didnt find 100 plausible,0.5880688755688755,0.29356095293595297,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,A Hitchcockian Billy Wilder,"At the end of the day the films you give top marks are those films that become constant companions. You can see them again at the drop of a hat, you show them to people who have never see them and it's always a triumph. ""Witness For The Prosecution"" is one of those wonders. Suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy this banquet of a romp. Charles Laughton showed here what he was made of better, more clearly and more loudly than in any other film and all of his films, at least the moments with him in it, are unforgettable - Captain Blight or Henry VIII, Quasimodo or that malefic Senator from South Carolina. Here the severity of his lawyer by vocation takes your senses away with his masterful judicial way to see logic and it's such an incredible fun to watch him do it. Tyrone Power is a toy in his hands but not Marlene Dietrich who stands her ground, not merely as a character but as a presence on the screen.

9.0,This witness is an absolute must!,"Naturally, the most popular Agatha Christie movie ever made, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (1957), although it looks as British as Big Ben, was actually filmed in Hollywood. Thanks to its great cast - Tyrone Power and Una O'Connor in their final movies, Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Elsa Lanchester, John Williams, Henry Daniell, and stage actor Francis Thompson as the judge - and the clever way the writers have opened out the stage play, this ""Witness for the Prosecution"" really grips and holds the interest even for those members of the audience (like myself) who know the plot backwards. Billy Wilder's direction is as adroit as ever, but on this occasion, it is skilfully impersonal, allowing players and plot to adroitly command and dominate center stage.

10.0,The Best of the Pre - 1970s Agatha Christie films?,"After the artistic success of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, the only notable film based on Dame Agatha Christie's stories was a remake of LOVE FROM A STRANGER with John Hodiak and Sylvia Sidney as the ill-matched couple, but re-staged in the 1890s rather than 1930 England. Then, in 1957, Billy Wilder made this production of a short story by Dame Agatha called WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. With a tip-top cast of Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power, and Elsa Lancaster, the film was a brilliantly done version of Christie's short story, changed in it's ending (but to a changed ending found in Christie's own dramatization). Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is a salesman who meets an elderly, wealthy woman (Norma Varden) and gains her affections - much to the dislike and mistrust of her servant (Una O'Connor). O'Connor claims she saw the two together the night that Varden was beaten to death in her apartment. Vole is arrested, and his solicitor (Henry Daniell) wants England's best barrister, Sir Wilfred Robarts (Laughton) to defend him. Robarts is recovering from a heart attack, and is being nursed by Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster). He is a difficult patient, and is not looking forward to an enforced rest in Bermuda. So, despite the protests of Plimsoll he takes the case. He does promise her he will listen to his doctor and take his medicine. She does not trust him. Sir Robert meets Vole's German born wife, Christina Helm (Dietrich), who alarms him. She is too cool, to detached at her husband's peril. But he goes ahead, and is soon in court fighting a first rate opponent (Torin Thatcher as Myers), and scores some impressive points against the prosecution, especially in cross-examining O'Connor. But at the critical moment he finds that by a subtle point of law, Dietrich can testify against Power, and does so. So the plot becomes, how to defeat this ""witness for the prosecution""? Is there something that can turn the tables on her and her testimony.And the evidence to use against Dietrich does appear - from an unexpected source. Is it effective? Will Power be saved in the end? Or is there something going on?Although the conclusion of this film has been pretty well known for years, I will refrain from explaining what it is. A good mystery should surprise the audience, as this does every audience that sees it for the first time. Laughton and Lancaster make a funny pair (and in the end, an endearing one from Lancaster's point of view). Power gets to play his most sinister part since ""the Great Stanton"" Carlyle in NIGHTMARE ALLEY. And Dietrich does pull off the biggest surprise twist in her career. As for Wilder, after some questionable films in the mid 1950s (THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS) he was back in form. His handling of the courtroom scenes (which make up nearly 60% of the film) are far more realistic and speedy than Alfred Hitchcock's plodding THE PARADINE CASE a decade earlier.

8.0,Love That Laughton,"Charlie Chaplin was funny. Charles Laughton was witty. As good as 'Witness For The Prosecution' is---Agatha Christie's story, the other actors, the technical expertise---the Oscar-nominated Laughton is THE reason to see this film. What he brings to Billy Wilder's 1957 courtroom thriller is his tremendous wit and intellect. It's a serious story, but the dark-comic tag team of Wilder/Laughton upgraded the film from ""a good courtroom mystery"" to ""a classic of the courtroom genre"".The headlining star, Tyrone Power, sure doesn't help them very much. He plays anguish about as smoothly as ripped sandpaper...and anguish is the unfortunate emotion he's got to play for most of the picture. Power has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. His wife (Marlene Dietrich) seems to be doing all she can to sell him out, appearing as...drum roll, please, drummer man...the star witness for the prosecution. Laughton is the brilliant (and ailing) English barrister defending Power. The plot twists 'n' turns a dozen ways from Sunday, just as it always does in Christie's best work.Amongst all the talk of bloody murder, there are running gags about cigars and alcohol. More dark wit---Laughton's character's poor health might cause him to drop dead at any moment. Wilder weaved thrills and smiles as well as any director. In this, he was wise to anchor the supporting cast with mainstays of the stiff upper lip. John Williams and Ian Wolfe (Hirsch from ""WKRP""), not to mention Laughton's control-freak assistant Elsa Lanchester (who was also CL's real-life wife), are bloody good.Movies of this type have been ripped off so often that students of the ""don't give away the ending"" class are bound to figure it out. I did. That hardly mattered because there were STILL more surprises to come. Through all that plot, Dietrich winds up being the most fascinating character.

,Billy Wilder meets Agatha Christie,"Another brilliant work in the legendary career of Billy Wilder. The director signs a cinematic adaptation of this Agatha Christie story: actually it is really as if the camera went on stage for filming the play. But the film is passionating and exciting, there's no time to get bored.Another thing we shall not forget is that Billy Wilder is European. He manages to keep the spirit of the film very British, with lots of humour and sarcasm. Compared to films like this one, ""legal"" movies from John Grisham's novels are empty and meaningless, without soul.Mr.Wilder is the director, we know; we have Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich: what a cast!

9.0,One of the best courtroom movies of all time,"Witness for the Prosecution is one of the most entertaining courtroom stories of all time, written by the crime mistress herself, Agatha Christie. Charles Laughton completely owns the courtroom, starring as a famously brilliant barrister who's supposed to be taking a break for his health-but he gets drawn in by a truly compelling murder trial. Tyrone Power, in his last movie, has been accused of murdering a wealthy older woman. While all the evidence racks up against him, Charles doesn't give up hope and tries to win the case, all the while trying to crack the very hard nut Marlene Dietrich. Marlene is Tyrone's wife, and it's impossible to tell what she's really thinking or feeling.I love this story, and I love both versions of the film, from 1957 and 1982. It's incredibly suspenseful and interesting-and also quite impossible to talk about without giving spoilers. If you've never seen Witness for the Prosecution, add this one to your list of classics to rent. The acting is fantastic, and the timing makes it a very entertaining old movie to watch.

7.0,Suspenseful and amusing Christie,"It's hard to imagine how Dame Agatha could have pounded out so many mysteries. I know she lived a long time, but still, if I lived as long as Methusala I couldn't grind out that many pieces. Not just novels, either, but plays, including this one. And they all tell the kinds of stories that involve a lot of lead time while the author works out the details of the intricate plots. Between Jack Kerouac knocking out ""On The Road"" on a single roll of toilet paper or whatever it was, and Nabokov and his multitudinous 3 X 5 index cards, Christie must have been very much closer to Nabokov.This is an engrossing and tightly wound tale of greed, murder, deception, bigamy, adultery, and all the other good things in life. It's essentially a courtroom drama with several big -- REALLY big -- surprises. It does not end the way you might expect, with the true criminal suddenly revealed in all his moral turpitude by the expert, penetrating examination by the defense, breaking down in the witness chair and sobbing, ""Okay. I did it! I DID IT! I didn't mean to kill her! I just wanted to frighten her."" The play's the thing in this movie, yet the director, Billy Wilder, brings his own snappy interpretation to it. The dialog is unashamedly fast. Nobody dawdles over ""significant utterances."" Even on the witness stand they seem to make a series of unhesitating declarations. ""Yes."" ""No."" ""Yes, I told you already."" And it wouldn't be as good as it is without the acting. Charles Laughton is the central figure, one of those cute old curmudgeons that everyone likes because of his weakness for cigars and brandy. His efforts to bootleg these items under the nose of his nurse, his real wife Elsa Lanchester, are pretty funny. ""She won't even find the ASHES,"" he cackles innocently, like a child getting away with mischief, flicking his cigar ash into an empty drawer. She's always bright and chipper and energetic, a nice contrast to his flabby sedate presence.Una O'Connor as the Scottish maid is extremely engaging as well, snapping back indignantly at the judge. Tyrone Power is called on to change from a careless and thoughtful guy, to one stricken by fate, then back again, and he pulls it off. Henry Daniell, a Robin Hood villain, and John Williams, ever the legal type, are welcome in every scene in which they appear. Reliable sorts, don't you know. But Marlene Dietrich takes the palm. She was everyone's idea of a no-baloney kind of woman but never anyone's idea of a great actress. And yet, she had me fooled here. Oh, hammy, sure, but her performances fit in because EVERYONE is hammy in ""Witness for the Prosecution."" God forbid anyone try to make anything serious and arty out of an Agatha Christie mystery!

10.0,"Wilder, Laughton, Lanchester, & Dietrich Add Sparkle to Christie's Courtroom Classic","WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! The Billy Wilder touch adds cynical wit to his sparkling adaptation of Dame Agatha Christie's play WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (WftP), with some of the best lines in a Wilder movie since DOUBLE INDEMNITY, thanks to Wilder, Harry Kurnitz, and Larry Marcus. In our household, ""Is that really desirable?"" has become a catchphrase, along with many other gems from the mouths of star Charles Laughton and the rest of the sterling cast! :-) I only hope people seeing this for the first time haven't already seen Marlene Dietrich's scene-stealing performance in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL, or they might tumble to the twist finale before they're supposed to! :-) (In fact, if I recall correctly, when WftP was shown on Turner Classic Movies, Robert Osborne mentioned in his intro that Welles helped Dietrich out with her WftP ""Cockney informant"" makeup as a favor!) La Dietrich looks fabulous and keeps you fascinated even when she's coming across as the ultimate bitch; it's a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar along with co-stars Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. Tyrone Power's usual slightly wooden delivery actually serves him well as the defendant; somehow it adds to defendant Leonard Vole's air of feckless innocence. Henry Daniell, John Williams, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, and particularly Norma Varden as the ill-fated Emily French provide able support, too, with Una O'Connor stealing her scenes as Mrs. French's loyal but ""antagnistic"" Scottish housekeeper. A young, brunette Ruta Lee provides a memorable moment or two. As sickly but sly barrister Wilfrid Robarts and his chipper but no-nonsense nurse, Miss Plimsoll, real-life husband and wife Laughton and Lanchester shine in the most engaging performances of their careers. The comic sparring chemistry between Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Miss Plimsoll, and the warmth and understanding that's grown between them by movie's end, had my husband Vinnie opining that if another movie was made featuring these characters, Miss Plimsoll would probably end up as Mrs. Robarts before it was over -- what a delightful series that could have been!

9.0,I Loved It!,"I don't think that it is quite as good as And Then There Were None, but this is an extremely good film, and I am 17. Both my dad and I think it is a well-directed, well-acted and well-constructed courtroom film, right up there with Anatomy of a Murder. I genuinely enjoyed this film, and really don't understand why it is ignored by people.The direction was solid and tight, as is usually the case with the late Billy Wilder. He deserves to be known as a great director, up there with David Lean and Alfred Hitchkock, both of whom have directed some of the greatest cinematic masterpieces in existence. What impressed me most was the nail-biting suspense put into the script, which was not only tense but very funny as well, evident with the character of Sir Wilfred. I would have never guessed the final solution, that Christina Vole was the gypsy you meet halfway through, even if I was an Agatha Christie fan or not.The acting was what made the movie. Tyrone Power was very good as the defendant Stephen Vole, accused of killing a spinster. It is so sad that he died a year later while filming Solomon and Sheba, but he did very well in his last completed role. Marlene Dietrich was brilliant as Christina, and her scenes in the courtroom are the main reason why this film should be seen. Stealing the film, however, is Charles Laughton as Sir Wilfred Robarts, with his acidic remarks and his charismatic presence. The scene with the monocle and the light is probably the most famous scene of the film, or certainly the one I'm most familiar with, and that was genius.In conclusion, a brilliant film, that just lacks the suspense and terror of And Then there Were None, though both films are full of both elements.

8.0,A Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game masterfully played and perfectly directed by the great Billy Wilder,"Entertaining suspense movie packs thrills , intrigue , twists and turns ; being realized in Hitchcock style . As the tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses including sensational acting , enjoyable dialog and interesting screenplay from start to finish . Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is detained on suspicion of killing an elderly acquaintance . He employs an experienced but aging barrister, Sir Wilfrid (Charles Lawton) as his defense attorney who is recovering from a severe heart attack . The ill advocate at law is attended by a nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester , they were real-life husband and wife). Excellent film packs drama , emotion , suspense and plot twists . This agreeable and often intriguing picture from master of comedy has a memorable scene after another . It contains interesting intrigue based on Agatha Christie's novel , fun intrigue , amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The film followed the basic story of Agatha Christie's play, but director and co-screenwriter Billy Wilder opened up the story by including numerous scenes that did not take place solely in the courtroom, as the play had, and changed the emphasis from ""Leonard Vole"" to ""Sir Wilfrid Robarts¨. Top-notch and unforgettable performance from Charles Laughton as the peculiar as well as intelligent barrister , throwing himself into the role with dedication and delight . Nice acting by Tyrone Power , this would be his last complete film , he would die of a heart attack while on the set of his next film (Salomon) less than one year after release of this one . Sensational support cast , including familiar faces such as Elsa Lanchester , John Williams , Henry Daniell , Ruta Lee , Torin Thatcher and veteran Ian Wolfe . Special mention for Una O'Connor , this was Una O'Connor's last big screen motion picture and she was the only member of the original Broadway cast of the play to repeat her role on film . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Russell Harlan . The producers were so concerned about the financial success of the film that during the credits, an announcer urges the audience not to reveal the film's ending to anyone . Lavishly produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and Edward Small , as the courtroom setting, which cost $75,000 to build, was a recreation of an actual courtroom in London's Central Criminal Courts , The Old Bailey. The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines , amusing dialogues , humor and entertaining intrigue . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , this ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Witness for prosecution¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching . It justly deserves its place among the best ¨Court Dramas¨ ever made . One of the very best films of all time and to see and see again . An extremely entertaining and riveting film and completely provoking , as it ranked #6 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"" . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same .",hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game masterfully played perfectly directed by great billy wilder,entertaining suspense movie packs thrills intrigue twists turns being realized hitchcock style as tale is ordinary hitchcock fare that plays preys senses including sensational acting enjoyable dialog interesting screenplay start finish leonard vole tyrone power is detained suspicion killing elderly acquaintance he employs experienced but aging barrister sir wilfrid charles lawton as his defense attorney who is recovering severe heart attack ill advocate at law is attended by nurse miss plimsoll elsa lanchester they were real life husband wife excellent film packs drama emotion suspense plot twists this agreeable often intriguing picture master comedy has memorable scene after another it contains interesting intrigue based agatha christies novel fun intrigue amusing situations keeps action at feverish pitch film followed basic story agatha christies play but director co screenwriter billy wilder opened up story by including numerous scenes that did not take place solely courtroom as play had changed emphasis leonard vole sir wilfrid robarts top notch unforgettable performance charles laughton as peculiar as well as intelligent barrister throwing himself into role with dedication delight nice acting by tyrone power this would be his last complete film he would die heart attack while set his next film salomon less than one year after release this one sensational support cast including familiar faces such as elsa lanchester john williams henry daniell ruta lee torin thatcher veteran ian wolfe special mention una oconnor this was una oconnors last big screen motion picture she was only member original broadway cast play repeat her role film evocative atmospheric cinematography black white by russell harlan producers were so concerned about financial success film that during credits announcer urges audience not reveal films ending anyone lavishly produced by arthur hornblow jr edward small as courtroom setting which cost 75 000 build was recreation actual courtroom londons central criminal courts old bailey motion picture was very well directed by billy wilder who includes several punchlines amusing dialogues humor entertaining intrigue billy was one best directors history 1939 started partnership with charles bracket such movies as ninotchka ball fire making their film debut as such with major minor sunset boulevard was their last picture together before they split up later billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter ial diamond both them won academy award stalag 17 dealing with pow camp starred by william holden after that they wrote produced directed such classics as ace hole touching romantic comedy sabrina this witness prosecution two movies with great star marilyn monroe warmth seven year itch some like hot all them include screenplays that sizzle with wit but their biggest success highpoint resulted be sour fun apartment subsequently 60s 70s duo fell headlong into pit they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as buddy buddy fedora front page secret life sherlock holmes though agreeable avanti slowed decline team had almost disappeared beneath wave bad reviews failures witness prosecution rating above average essential indispensable watching it justly deserves its place among best court dramas ever made one very best films all time see see again extremely entertaining riveting film completely provoking as it ranked american film institutes list 10 greatest films genre courtroom drama its kind movie where you know whats coming but because treatment enjoy it all same,0.46585874799357946,0.2490971107544142,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,Another Remarkable Movie by Billy Wilder,"When the efficient but bitter and stubborn barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) returns to his office in London recovering from a heart attack, he is invited to defend Leonard Stephen Vole (Tyrone Power), who is the prime suspect in a murder case. Leonard is a former soldier that fought in World War II and is married with his beloved German wife Christine Helm Vole (Marlene Dietrich). He is unemployed and accused of seducing and murdering the wealthy middle-aged single woman Emily French (Norma Varden) to inherit 80,000 pounds. His unique alibi would be the testimony of Christine, which would not be accepted by the court, since she is his wife. Along the trial, Christine is surprisingly called to testify in court by the prosecution, when secrets about their lives are disclosed.""Witness for the Prosecution"" is another remarkable movie by Billy Wilder and one of the best about trial. The plot is perfectly tied-up without any flaw in the screenplay, which has many plot points and witty lines in a perfect combination of the caustic and sarcastic ""British humor"" with crime, drama and mystery.

9.0,"Agatha Christie is a classical detective story writer; arguably, THE classical detective story writer.","Let me explain.The best book on music I've ever read is ""The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven"", by Charles Rosen. (Read it, it's fascinating.) One of Rosen's claims is that the classical style was the offspring of two impulses: the desire to surprise, and the desire to be formally perfect, to sound ""right"". In the decades before Haydn's maturity there were composers who startled and composers who satisfied; Haydn was the first to startle and satisfy in the same breath.Detective story writers have the same ideal as classical composers. The solution must surprise us; yet the ""shape"" of the story, to those who know the solution, must be beautiful. And, as in music, it's hard to surprise and satisfy at once. If you must go one way or the other, much better to satisfy. One can see the denouement of a Thorndyke story by R. Austin Freeman a mile off, but it's always perfectly crafted, and that is enough. Too many modern detective stories startle us by having the murderer turn out to be one of a dozen characters when it could so easily have been one of the other eleven and nobody would have particularly cared because there's little beauty in the story whoever it turns out to be. But Agatha Christie ... not for nothing is she called ""classical"". Her solutions are almost always surprising - she may have been better at misdirection than anyone else who ever lived - but they always, in a way that's hard to describe, make perfect dramatic sense. -Okay, so she's not the world's best mystery WRITER. But I often think she attracts undue criticism because she so obviously writes less well than she plots, while the literary defects of writers who can't plot either pass unnoticed.For all these reasons I'm surprised there aren't more first-rate films based on her works. (I can understand, though, why ""The Mousetrap"" has never been filmed.) Looking through the IMDb list of twenty-eight cinematic Christies, I'm surprised how many of the ones I've seen fall short of their potential. And twenty-eight isn't really, when you think about it, that many, especially when so many of them are remakes of earlier ones.Still, most are worth watching, and this particular one is excellent. Faithful to the play, it has the usual finely crafted, classical, Agatha Christie twist. Wilder made it at a moment in his career when he could do no wrong. It must have taken him all of two seconds to decide that Charles Laughton would make the perfect Sir Wilfrid; then, perhaps, another fifteen minutes to settle on Marlene Dietrich as the title character. Just as ""Double Indemnity"" is set in a black-and-white California, ""Witness"" is set in a black-and-white England - it makes me wonder if it's a mistake filming Agatha Christie in colour.

9.0,I'm constantly surprised that women's hats don't provoke more murders.,"Leonard Steven Vole finds himself on trial for the murder of a wealthy widow from whom he has inherited a fortune. Top barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts takes up the defendants case, but he, along with everyone else, is stunned when Vole's seemingly loving wife Christine turns up to testify against the defendant.Based on Agatha Christie's successful 1953 play, ""Witness For The Prosecution"" benefited from fine tuning from master director Billy Wilder and writing partner Harry Kurnitz. Here the dialogue becomes razor sharp and the characters are fully realised with quite wonderful results, but chiefly the masterstroke here is not letting a court room drama become just that, a court room drama. The film plays out with no wasted scenes, no moments of boredom, and it has such vim and vigour you sometimes forget that there actually is drama in the story.The cast here are on fine form, Wilder had wanted to work with Charles Laughton for some time, and it's obvious that both parties here are getting the best out of each other. Laughton is a pure delight as Robarts, a sharp tongue, all bluster and cheeky into the bargain, his interplay with Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's real life wife Elsa Lanchester) is quality, and it's another testament to Wilder's genius for putting them together. Tyrone Power, in what would be his last completed film before sadly passing away, is devilishly smart as Vole, whilst Torin Thatcher is great as the gruff prosecution barrister Myers. Yet as good as they all are, they all sit in the shadow of Marlene Dietrich and her turn as Christine Vole, sultry and femme fatalistic, it's a sizzling performance that crowns this delightful film.It occurred to me overnight that it's probably the closest film that Wilder got to being Hitchcockian, and I'm pretty sure the big master of suspense himself would have enjoyed this one. It's a mystery that is dramatic, it's a thriller that is also funny, it's pretty much a multi genre classic. 9/10",im constantly surprised that womens hats dont provoke more murders,leonard steven vole finds himself trial murder wealthy widow whom he has inherited fortune top barrister sir wilfrid robarts takes up defendants case but he along with everyone else is stunned when voles seemingly loving wife christine turns up testify against defendant based agatha christies successful 1953 play witness prosecution benefited fine tuning master director billy wilder writing partner harry kurnitz here dialogue becomes razor sharp characters are fully realised with quite wonderful results but chiefly masterstroke here is not letting court room drama become just that court room drama film plays out with no wasted scenes no moments boredom it has such vim vigour you sometimes forget that there actually is drama story cast here are fine form wilder had wanted work with charles laughton some time its obvious that both parties here are getting best out each other laughton is pure delight as robarts sharp tongue all bluster cheeky into bargain his interplay with miss plimsoll laughtons real life wife elsa lanchester is quality its another testament wilders genius putting them together tyrone power what would be his last completed film before sadly passing away is devilishly smart as vole whilst torin thatcher is great as gruff prosecution barrister myers yet as good as they all are they all sit shadow marlene dietrich her turn as christine vole sultry femme fatalistic its sizzling performance that crowns this delightful film it occurred me overnight that its probably closest film that wilder got being hitchcockian im pretty sure big master suspense himself would have enjoyed this one its mystery that is dramatic its thriller that is also funny its pretty much multi genre classic 9 10,0.6055905695611578,0.2888305322128851,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.3}"
10.0,What a movie!,"A film I have not seen for years but will always remember with fondness. A classic thriller with all the right ingredients - Power and Dietrich are spectacular, and, by early standards (and recent ones!), the twist is excellent. Charles Laughton however, provides us with a glib chuckle as the aging defense attorney ruled by his overlord maid. A distraction that only adds to an excellent plot line.I can't imagine another film of the genre and the era, that so wickedly entangles the essential thriller with a 'crime of passion' (oops, spot the plot killer...) gem.

8.0,Superb courtroom drama,"I just finished watching Live Free and Die Harder for the second time. I was blown away by the special effects, and Bruce Willis' capability to take more punishment than a human could be expected to and live.After that I wanted something that had the same fireworks but done with acting and not special effects. This film fit the bill nicely.The acting in this film was so spectacular that calls for every superlative in the book. While I have watched Billy Wilder direct comedy, I never expected to see him do something that rivals Hitchcock. In fact, if you didn't know it was Wilder beforehand, you would easily call this a Hitchcock film.Tyrone Power as the defendant was so smooth that you knew he was a guilty man. You just knew it, even though he kept denying it. He was perfect as the cad that preys on elderly women. Marlene Dietrich gave what I thought was the performance of a lifetime as his wife. She definitely provided the fireworks and the surprises to this film. Charles Laughton as the barrister that tried the case was magnificent. There are not enough words to describe the performance he provided. Supreme enjoyment every time he opened his mouth. Of course, you cannot ignore Elsa Lanchester as the nurse that failed miserably at trying to control Laughton after a heart attack. The two of them provided so much humor to this film that one would want to see it again and again just for that.Nothing can be said about the film without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. It is well worth the time in finding it on cable or adding it to your queue.",superb courtroom drama,i just finished watching live free die harder second time i was blown away by special effects bruce willis capability take more punishment than human could be expected live after that i wanted something that had same fireworks but done with acting not special effects this film fit bill nicely acting this film was so spectacular that calls every superlative book while i have watched billy wilder direct comedy i never expected see him do something that rivals hitchcock fact if you didnt know it was wilder beforehand you would easily call this hitchcock film tyrone power as defendant was so smooth that you knew he was guilty man you just knew it even though he kept denying it he was perfect as cad that preys elderly women marlene dietrich gave what i thought was performance lifetime as his wife she definitely provided fireworks surprises this film charles laughton as barrister that tried case was magnificent there are not enough words describe performance he provided supreme enjoyment every time he opened his mouth course you cannot ignore elsa lanchester as nurse that failed miserably at trying control laughton after heart attack two them provided so much humor this film that one would want see it again again just that nothing can be said about film without spoiling it those who havent seen it it is well worth time finding it cable or adding it your queue,0.486247947454844,0.15981489774593224,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.14, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.23}"
9.0,Like Perry Mason? You'll love this...,"I first saw this movie about 15 years ago and loved it. I just watched it on VHS and was captivated all over again. Agatha Christie's story, Billy Wilder's screenplay and direction, and the four main leads all get it right. Charles Laughton is absolutely superb, and Elsa Lanchester is a perfect foil.Agatha Christie's story has more twists and turns than a roller coaster and this provides a strong foundation for the movie. But the actors give life to the characters. I haven't seen the 1982 version, but I'll admit to a bias for Marlene Dietrich. She and Tyrone Power pull just the right punches.It's a mystery, of course. But a top notch one. So if you want only to dabble in the genre, this is the one to try. (If you like mysteries, it goes without saying that you must see it.) Moreover, this is one B&W movie for people who don't like B&W movies.",like perry mason youll love this,i first saw this movie about 15 years ago loved it i just watched it vhs was captivated all over again agatha christies story billy wilders screenplay direction four main leads all get it right charles laughton is absolutely superb elsa lanchester is perfect foil agatha christies story has more twists turns than roller coaster this provides strong foundation movie but actors give life characters i havent seen 1982 version but ill admit bias marlene dietrich she tyrone power pull just right punches its mystery course but top notch one so if you want only dabble genre this is one try if you like mysteries it goes without saying that you must see it moreover this is one b w movie people who dont like b w movies,0.6824175824175824,0.39395604395604394,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.41}"
9.0,This viewer has reached a verdict: this movie is tremendously entertaining.,"Hollywood legend Tyrone Power, in his final completed film role, plays Leonard Vole, accused of the murder of a lonely rich middle aged woman, Mrs. Emily Jane French (Norma Varden). They'd struck up a friendship, and he continued to see her in the hopes that she'd finance the inventions that he wanted to market. Now she's dead, and all evidence points to him being the killer. Taking his case is the irascible, witty barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts (Charles Laughton, in a delicious, Oscar nominated performance), who's recovering from a heart attack.This viewer shouldn't relay too much about the plot, but, as adapted from Agatha Christies' play, it's riveting stuff. While it obviously derives from a stage work with so much focus on dialogue and performance, it's the crackling, often funny dialogue and superior acting that makes this so effective and seemingly quickly paced for a film running just under two hours. The script, written by Harry Kurnitz and the well regarded director Billy Wilder, obviously takes great delight in the twist laden scenario. ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is often throwing surprises at the audience, and while more savvy folk may be able to predict a fair deal, the ways in which characters and viewers alike are manipulated is nothing short of masterful.There's a great deal of humor to be found in the relationship between Sir Wilfrid and his nursemaid Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester, a.k.a. Mrs. Laughton). She's annoying in a lively, endearing way, and his reactions to her are simply priceless. Lanchester was also Oscar nominated for her scene stealing, comedic work.There are no slackers here, especially when you realize there are performances within performances being given here. Power is quite engaging, and Marlene Dietrich is highly striking as the German woman whom he took as a ""wife"". Wonderful support is provided by John Williams, Henry Daniell, Ian Wolfe, Torin Thatcher, Ms. Varden, Una O'Connor (that scenery devouring player from some of the Universal horror films of the 1930s, cast here as the housekeeper), Francis Compton, Philip Tonge, and Ruta Lee.The filmmaking is slick without calling attention to itself, with Wilder and company completely trusting the source material. The result is a smashing entertainment that deserves to be rediscovered.Nine out of 10.",this viewer has reached verdict this movie is tremendously entertaining,hollywood legend tyrone power his final completed film role plays leonard vole accused murder lonely rich middle aged woman mrs emily jane french norma varden theyd struck up friendship he continued see her hopes that shed finance inventions that he wanted market now shes dead all evidence points him being killer taking his case is irascible witty barrister sir wilfrid roberts charles laughton delicious oscar nominated performance whos recovering heart attack this viewer shouldnt relay too much about plot but as adapted agatha christies play its riveting stuff while it obviously derives stage work with so much focus dialogue performance its crackling often funny dialogue superior acting that makes this so effective seemingly quickly paced film running just under two hours script written by harry kurnitz well regarded director billy wilder obviously takes great delight twist laden scenario witness prosecution is often throwing surprises at audience while more savvy folk may be able predict fair deal ways which characters viewers alike are manipulated is nothing short masterful theres great deal humor be found relationship between sir wilfrid his nursemaid miss plimsoll elsa lanchester k mrs laughton shes annoying lively endearing way his reactions her are simply priceless lanchester was also oscar nominated her scene stealing comedic work there are no slackers here especially when you realize there are performances within performances being given here power is quite engaging marlene dietrich is highly striking as german woman whom he took as wife wonderful support is provided by john williams henry daniell ian wolfe torin thatcher ms varden una oconnor that scenery devouring player some universal horror films 1930s cast here as housekeeper francis compton philip tonge ruta lee filmmaking is slick without calling attention itself with wilder company completely trusting source material result is smashing entertainment that deserves be rediscovered nine out 10,0.6118421052631579,0.3028508771929824,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.29}"
