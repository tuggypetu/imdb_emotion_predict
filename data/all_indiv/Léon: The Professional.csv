10,Masterful,"I have long thought that owning films on DVD or video is a waste of money - you watch them once and after that they are left to fester at the back of a cupboard. Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.It obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners, he is hardly your typical gun-toting action hero, but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon's life is as simple as a small child's: TV, lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read, he doesn't sleep, he hasn't the trappings of family or wealth (the fees for his hits are habitually trousered by his `benefactor': sleazy small-time Italian gangster Tony (Danny Aiello)) - In short, he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.Normally I can't stand Hollywood kids. They are all doey-eyed, bouffant-haired brats who can cry on cue and are always ready with a cutesy, smart-alec comment that will cause their adult co-stars to tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully. Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.Natalie Portman's Mathilda is the antithesis of these namby-pamby Dawson's Creek actors-in-waiting. For starters, she has something justifiable to gripe about, in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow, to say the least, but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history, but one of the most memorable.On the face of it, a love story between a twelve year old girl and a hairy French hitman would raise a few eyebrows among more conservative movie-goers, but director Luc Besson handles it so beautifully, it seems like the most natural thing on earth. They are united in being totally alone in the world - indeed, the scene where Mathilda walks quietly down the corridor past the carnage in her apartment and knocks on Leon's door, imploring him in a tearful whisper to let her in is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking. Leon is wary at first, but she soon wins him round and starts to gently bring him out of the shell.Portman is truly astonishing - one can almost forgive her for being a part of the appalling Star Wars prequels on the strength of this one performance. The iconic image of this tiny, grubby little girl clutching Leon's beloved plant and trotting to keep up with her lanky hero's giant strides is one that will live long in the memory.Aiello and Oldman (at his sadistic, malevolent best) provide predictably excellent support, there is a wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending - heck, there's even a decent Sting song playing over the credits - for this (if nothing else) it would be remiss of me to give Leon anything other than top marks.10/10",masterful,i have long thought that owning films dvd or video is waste money you watch them once after that they are left fester at back cupboard occasionally i make exception some films simply cannot be fully appreciated just one viewing every time i watch leon is as gripping enjoyable as first sad funny violent incredibly touching few films manage tick all boxes even fewer are about hitmen it obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as jean reno thin wiry with toilet brush hair face like bag spanners he is hardly your typical gun toting action hero but he has innocence compassion that makes you fall him instantly leons life is as simple as small childs tv lashings milk odd gangland assassination he cannot read he doesnt sleep he hasnt trappings family or wealth fees his hits are habitually trousered by his benefactor sleazy small time italian gangster tony danny aiello short he lives like robot then he meets mathilda normally i cant stand hollywood kids they are all doey eyed bouffant haired brats who can cry cue are always ready with cutesy smart alec comment that will cause their adult co stars tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully often they are kidnapped huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry i one am usually rooting kidnappers natalie portmans mathilda is antithesis these namby pamby dawsons creek actors waiting starters she has something justifiable gripe about that her entire family has just been slaughtered by gary oldman his gang crooked dea officers this is bit blow say least but mathilda takes it all her stride teams up with leon bid revenge so begins one stranger relationships silver screen history but one most memorable face it love story between twelve year old girl hairy french hitman would raise few eyebrows among more conservative movie goers but director luc besson handles it so beautifully it seems like most natural thing earth they are united being totally alone world indeed scene where mathilda walks quietly down corridor past carnage her apartment knocks leons door imploring him tearful whisper let her is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking leon is wary at first but she soon wins him round starts gently bring him out shell portman is truly astonishing one can almost forgive her being part appalling star wars prequels strength this one performance iconic image this tiny grubby little girl clutching leons beloved plant trotting keep up with her lanky heros giant strides is one that will live long memory aiello oldman at his sadistic malevolent best provide predictably excellent support there is wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending heck theres even decent sting song playing over credits this if nothing else it would be remiss me give leon anything other than top marks 10 10,0.5148359788359786,0.10921236171236175,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.38, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9,Being a good hitman takes more than merely a willingness to lay down one's life.,"I first saw this in the late 90s. Then again in the mid 2k on a dvd i own.Revisited the remastered extended version last night with my family.This movie is more than just a hitman or an assassin movie.The music is top notch, the characters are very well developed, the action scenes n direction are stylish.But the best part are the scenes between Reno n Portman. Leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by Reno.There is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).The only thing good in the Bollywood movie is that the guy who played Tony gives away all of the hitman's money to the girl whereas in the original, the character of Tony gives only a single currency note to Mathilda n keeps blabbing the same ""safer than the usual bank story"".",being good hitman takes more than merely willingness lay down ones life,i first saw this late 90s then again mid 2k dvd i own revisited remastered extended version last night with my family this movie is more than just hitman or assassin movie music is top notch characters are very well developed action scenes n direction are stylish but best part are scenes between reno n portman leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by reno there is bollywood copy known as bichoo scorpio only thing good bollywood movie is that guy who played tony gives away all hitmans money girl whereas original character tony gives only single currency note mathilda n keeps blabbing same safer than usual bank story,0.48367394179894174,0.19783399470899474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.04, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10,Besson's masterpiece - action cinema with real heart,"Despite having a mainly American cast and being set on the rough streets of New York, this is very much a French film, evident from the crew list at the end of the film. I'm always one to give foreign film-makers a try, as they usually offer up something a little bit more stylish and different than the usual formula. Take Lucio Fulci with his trademark 'hard' and nightmarish horror films, Dario Argento with his gory yet stylistic giallo films, or John Woo's violent, ballet-like action films.Luc Besson doesn't disappoint with this film, offering us his typical lashings of wit, and drawing charisma and charm from his cast. While THE FIFTH ELEMENT bordered on being silly in places, it was still a fun science fiction film, and kudos to the man for experimenting with different genres. LEON is probably the first film that brought him to the typical American's attention, and I would say deservedly so. While masquerading as a typical action-filled gun fest, it is in fact a film of three parts. The beginning is packed with horrible, unflinching violence from killers who don't have the slightest feeling of remorse - Jean Reno expertly massacres a squad of bodyguards, while Gary Oldman shotguns children and people in the bath. The middle of the film is more like a conventional drama, and it tells the story of Leon, the hit-man, and Mathilda, the young orphaned victim, and their growing love for one another which draws the human side of Leon out of his impassive shell. The ending is indeed all out action.All parts of the film are great, and Besson frequently shows his American contemporaries how it should be done. As the box says, it is extremely hard-hitting at the beginning, with deaths shown in all their bloody impact. The ending is also brilliant, with a SWAT team laying siege to Leon's apartment; this is non-stop, violent action and easily rivals any blockbuster like FACE/OFF. However, the film's main triumph is that it really makes us care about the two central characters, thanks to the script, Besson, and of course the actors involved.This is the film that really made Jean Reno something of a star. He's great as the Bruce Willis-like ageing hero, even if he does mercilessly kill people. Natalie Portman is also likable as the child who is old beyond her years, and almost unrecognisable from the bland role she played in STAR WARS. The villain is a drug-taking maniac, brilliantly played with startling intensity by Gary Oldman, who frequently shows his competitors how it should be done. LEON may be sentimental, but this sentiment slowly grows from the start and is realistic and believable, it is not shoved down our throats. Also, check out the ending, which manages to be very good and fitting, and yet sad at the same time. It will make you yell and cry in equal measure.",bessons masterpiece action cinema with real heart,despite having mainly american cast being set rough streets new york this is very much french film evident crew list at end film im always one give foreign film makers try as they usually offer up something little bit more stylish different than usual formula take lucio fulci with his trademark hard nightmarish horror films dario argento with his gory yet stylistic giallo films or john woos violent ballet like action films luc besson doesnt disappoint with this film offering us his typical lashings wit drawing charisma charm his cast while fifth element bordered being silly places it was still fun science fiction film kudos man experimenting with different genres leon is probably first film that brought him typical americans attention i would say deservedly so while masquerading as typical action filled gun fest it is fact film three parts beginning is packed with horrible unflinching violence killers who dont have slightest feeling remorse jean reno expertly massacres squad bodyguards while gary oldman shotguns children people bath middle film is more like conventional drama it tells story leon hit man mathilda young orphaned victim their growing love one another which draws human side leon out his impassive shell ending is indeed all out action all parts film are great besson frequently shows his american contemporaries how it should be done as box says it is extremely hard hitting at beginning with deaths shown all their bloody impact ending is also brilliant with swat team laying siege leons apartment this is non stop violent action easily rivals any blockbuster like face off however films main triumph is that it really makes us care about two central characters thanks script besson course actors involved this is film that really made jean reno something star hes great as bruce willis like ageing hero even if he does mercilessly kill people natalie portman is also likable as child who is old beyond her years almost unrecognisable bland role she played star wars villain is drug taking maniac brilliantly played with startling intensity by gary oldman who frequently shows his competitors how it should be done leon may be sentimental but this sentiment slowly grows start is realistic believable it is not shoved down our throats also check out ending which manages be very good fitting yet sad at same time it will make you yell cry equal measure,0.4732692347909739,0.02937851600895079,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"
10,A shameful praise of a fantastic film.,"Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hitman. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is Leon's neighbour. A young girl, she lives with her father, step-mother, half-sister and half-brother. As unhappy as Leon, she lives in awe of the dark stranger, unaware of his true profession. Beaten by her parents and sister, she has abandoned school and instead spends the day watching cartoons and trying to escape from the real world.When Mathilda's family is brutally murdered by a drug crazed Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbour. When she learns of Leon's true identity, she becomes infatuated with both him, and the grim world he inhabits.This stark portrayal of humanity and inhumanity is produced with the style and finesse that one expects from Luc Besson. In addition, the combined talents of Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman provide not only an unmatched on-screen chemistry, but also three perfectly created characterisations, the like of which are rarely seen in today's cinema. This film has my personal recommendation of being the best piece of cinema that I know of. I have not seen anything that matches it in terms of intensity or emotion - and believe me, I've looked. I found myself caring for the characters involved, an unique experience in itself. This is not the type of film for a night in with your mates, but nevertheless, it is an unforgettable piece of cinematic history.",shameful praise fantastic film,leon jean reno is tortured soul he lives squalor misery never truly happy or at peace with himself after all he is hitman he lives quietly kill kill harming no one whom he has not been paid assassinate he is simplistic childlike man who lives by his own set morals but is troubled by them one thing he seems fear above all else is change mathilda natalie portman is leons neighbour young girl she lives with her father step mother half sister half brother as unhappy as leon she lives awe dark stranger unaware his true profession beaten by her parents sister she has abandoned school instead spends day watching cartoons trying escape real world when mathildas family is brutally murdered by drug crazed norman stansfield gary oldman her only chance survival is hide with her neighbour when she learns leons true identity she becomes infatuated with both him grim world he inhabits this stark portrayal humanity inhumanity is produced with style finesse that one expects luc besson addition combined talents jean reno natalie portman gary oldman provide not only unmatched screen chemistry but also three perfectly created characterisations like which are rarely seen todays cinema this film has my personal recommendation being best piece cinema that i know i have not seen anything that matches it terms intensity or emotion believe me ive looked i found myself caring characters involved unique experience itself this is not type film night with your mates but nevertheless it is unforgettable piece cinematic history,0.6367816091954024,0.06609195402298852,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10,A Perfect Chemistry,"In New York, León (Jean Reno) is an Italian professional hit-man, who loves drinking milk and has a plant as his best friend. His godfather and mentor is the mobster Tony (Danny Aiello), who loves León as if he were his own son, and his cold blood makes him a perfect killer. When Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his gang executes the family of his twelve years old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman), León lodges the girl in his place, beginning a weird friendship between a killer and a confused girl wishing revenge. When Mathilda finds who Stansfield is, she presses León to kill him. 'León' is a wonderful movie, having one of the most perfect chemistry in the cinema between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. The storyline recalls some parts of John Cassavetes' 'Gloria', but the performances of the debutant Natalie Portman and the always-excellent Jean Reno upgrade this film. There are at least three scenes that I really love: the light on the corridor, when León opens the door for Mathilda; when they are walking together in a New York street, coming towards the camera; and when Stansfield hits León. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'O Profissional' ('The Professional')",perfect chemistry,new york le n jean reno is italian professional hit man who loves drinking milk has plant as his best friend his godfather mentor is mobster tony danny aiello who loves le n as if he were his own son his cold blood makes him perfect killer when stansfield gary oldman his gang executes family his twelve years old neighbor mathilda natalie portman le n lodges girl his place beginning weird friendship between killer confused girl wishing revenge when mathilda finds who stansfield is she presses le n kill him le n is wonderful movie having one most perfect chemistry cinema between jean reno natalie portman storyline recalls some parts john cassavetes gloria but performances debutant natalie portman always excellent jean reno upgrade this film there are at least three scenes that i really love light corridor when le n opens door mathilda when they are walking together new york street coming towards camera when stansfield hits le n my vote is ten title brazil o profissional professional,0.5956709956709956,0.3225108225108225,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.23}"
10,Gripping story with well-crafted characters,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",gripping story with well crafted characters,luc bessons movie l professional gives us intense story which is maximized potential by casting movie done by todd thaler every aspect movie delivers audience makes impressive overall package jean reno plays character named l who has learned repress his emotions order perform his job as cleaner or hit man his secluded world is shattered by young girl named mathilda who lives same floor as he does apartment building when she turns him help he learns about living normal life even if circumstances which unite them are far normal performance delivered by then twelve year old natalie portman as mathilda is nothing short brilliant her ability relate others with body movement facial gestures is matched by few she really brings raw emotion believability difficult role mathilda l are unexpectedly thrown together but learn value life their chance encounter how valuable friendship can be jean reno as l gives us solemn calculated character who sets all his energy his assignments until her is given something else care about mathilda gives him daughter that he never had while l serves as father friend her gary oldman as corrupt dea agent norman stansfield offers viewers amazingly wired electrical performance which pushes envelope he moves story along by his actions oldman offers us memorable portrait sadistically obsessed man who stops short nothing get what he wants professional is what movie making is all about without overuse special effects large shooting location or commercially star studded cast we are given all that could possibly be asked movie portman oldman reno along with danny aiello as hit contractor tony remind us that there is no substitute great acting there are elements comedy drama action great original music by eric serra adds energy film already encapsulates most impressive thing about movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all other elements which go into making movie simply put intense impressive movie,0.5398595848595849,0.1886813186813187,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9,Visceral and intelligent - Besson's masterpiece,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it. In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",visceral intelligent bessons masterpiece,leon is one most emotionally intense movies ever made french director luc besson uses everything actors music camera angles lighting create unique experience its not realism its not naturalism its heightened reality as gary oldman very well put it making professional besson says if i imagine somebody street try knock my daughter i kill guy five seconds i kill him i think its me im beast this part we cant forget that part us genetic things inside are much much older than ten commandments he certainly uses visceral scenes create very strong emotion movie blood running mathildas nose or stansfields unforgettable everyone are just couple examples music sound are excellent are used masterly fashion you can hear fatmans heart beating desperately or low claustrophobic sound when stansfield turns look at mathildas father however leon does not work only this primary level it also has intelligent story it may seem be almost fairy tale but dont be fooled just like his character besson is serious this movie has message without love we are dead even if we dont see it only true love give meaning our lives everything else reminds me big yogurt warm rancid as mathilda says original script which is available net under name leon version 1 is this true real life i dont know but this movie can make you wonder then course theres sensuality its hypocritical deny it camera interacts with mathilda mesmerising fashion its not sick its not degrading its art subtle beautiful leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven its movie that really should not be missed unless you are concerned with its amorality dont be leon is less violent than many action movies unusual relationship between main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling tact,0.5714980158730159,0.24343253968253964,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
7,a symphony in film,"luc besson will never top this movie. This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It's a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.The actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film.

9,"A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date","I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now.

10,A Brilliant Conflict,"This film, better known in the U.S. as ""The Professional"", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a ""cleaner"" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of ""La Femme Nikita"" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, ""The Fifth Element.""",brilliant conflict,this film better known u s as professional is wonderful intense film jean reno plays his role as cleaner with incredible subtlety leon tries keep his emotions completely suppressed yet matilda extraordinary performance by young natalie portman who is destined become very powerful actress into her adult life bring out him new found joy life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts but most dynamic element this film is undeniably gary oldmans performance as wildly sadistic crooked dea agent with his own narcotic induced demons his obsessions eventually lead him brink absolute madness his hunt cleaner truly this is oldmans finest performance date worthy oscar glory though sadly forgotten so luc besson did indeed top his triumph la femme nikita by far with this masterpiece though i cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with sci fi misfire fifth element,0.5864718614718615,0.28010822510822503,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.24}"
10,"Excellent, smart action film.","Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery.

10,Masterpiece of violent Characterisations and fast action-shooting,"An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.This idea continues in Léon. Léon was Besson's first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and Léon are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.I always found that until obtaining the ""Version Integral"" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an ""offending"" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.And so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson's films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson's style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno's and by far Natalie Portman's best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.Stylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson's work. Characters are larger than life. Décors are in excess of realism. Besson's characters lack psychological depth. ""The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar."" Besson's use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson's work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""La Cité des Enfants perdu"".

10,An Action Film For Lovers,"With enough blood and gore to please any fan of action movies, and a unique love story to please the ladies, this is a great movie for couples to watch together. However, to truly comprehend the beauty of this film, you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie, but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the un-cut version is seen.The two main characters are a recently-orphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hitman who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity, good and evil, and the interplay of life, death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost super-human 'professional', but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman, but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable, but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is, and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil, and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for. Besson does great actions scenes - especially the explosions.

7,The hit-man and her.,"An unlikely relationship forms between 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who seeks revenge on the gangsters who slaughtered her family, and an assassin, Léon (Jean Reno), who lives in the same apartment building and teaches her how to 'clean'.A love story between a grown man and a twelve year old girl: sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it? Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkwardSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with Léon rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is Léon's lover.Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from Léon. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",hit man her,unlikely relationship forms between 12 year old mathilda natalie portman who seeks revenge gangsters who slaughtered her family assassin l jean reno who lives same apartment building teaches her how clean love story between grown man twelve year old girl sounds bit dodgy doesnt it director luc besson tries his hardest pull it off by making renos character almost childlike having portmans mathilda act well beyond her years swearing smoking more than capable looking after herself end though it still feels very awkward sporting louise brooks bobbed haircut wearing shorts vest mathilda is definitely sexualised kinda like cross between lolita mindy kick ass that girl lazy town which makes her relationship with l rather uncomfortable viewing at times especially when characters declare their feelings each other or when mathilda tells hotel manager that she is l ons lover thankfully films love angle is never developed beyond platonic besson breaks up emotional drama with numerous shootouts explosions as mathilda tries find kill villain stansfield gary oldman with help l its mindlessly entertaining i suppose but not nearly good enough warrant films current imdb ranking top 250 6 5 out 10 rounded up 7 imdb,0.525,0.01967948717948718,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.29}"

8,Great film with one of the most memorable duos in film history,"""Lèon"" is a 1994 movie written and directed by Luc Besson and named after its central character played by Jean Reno. The film went almost completely under the radar in terms of awards recognition outside of France, but its reputation steadily rose over the years and it is now pretty much considered a classic. Besson was in his mid-30s when he made this movie, but already had a respectable résumé including a French and English version of ""Nikita"". For Reno and Oldman this is probably still the most famous work (not counting Oldman's efforts in the Batman movies) and for Portman it goes right along with other blockbusters like ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Black Swan"", which gave her the Oscar. I am still a bit disappointed Reno was not present at the ceremony. For Portman, Mathilda was the first role in a movie. Also in the film is Danny Aiello as a friend to Léon. His role wasn't clear early on to me as it seemed unsure what he was doing with the money, but as the film went on it showed that he was pretty close to Léon.The film begins with an introduction of what Léon does. He is a contract killer, who, in fact only wants a little talk as we find out in the first sequence. The way he disappears into the dark is pretty cool. What is a more sad than cool is the one scene where Léon's loneliness is displayed. However, when we see him in the theater he does not seem to mind at all. His face expression while watching the movie is so much fun. He is also a milk junkie (just like myself). Sadly, I got no little girl that brings all this milk to me. There are many cult references closely connected with this film: the shades, the long coat, the piggy, the plant (rootless like Léon, nice quote), the chewing gum trick... After the intro, Portman and Oldman (character name Stansfield, a pill-popping Beethoven-listening psychopath cop) pretty much enter the film at the same time. Oldman's character is really scary, even his colleagues fear him. If you listen closely, Matilda's dad only dares to shout at Stansfield's partner Malky, not at him. The fact that Oldman is not physically intimidating at all makes him even scarier as he must be a complete nutcase if people three times his size fear him. Another little snippet: One of the actors who play Stansfield's helpers died during the terrorist attacks on 9/11 during his work as a firefighter seven years after the movie. When Mathilda's family is killed, the writers already gave it their best to make them look as unlikeable as possible being very violent to their daughter/sister, except the very small one of course. It's pretty sad when Mathilda describes him as a kid who only wanted to cuddle. However, we also find out that her dad paid a tuition fee for one year in advance, so he can't be all bad. I wondered about Oldman's character why the internal commission isn't getting worried if so many people that cross his way keep dying.One of my favorite scenes from the film is when Mathilda returns with the milk, hears her family is dead and knocks on Léon's door. Very intense moment with her begging going against his principles. Finally he lets her in, physically and mentally into his life. He becomes her mentor, she becomes his housewife and quickly develops some sexual tension (quiz game for example or talk about virginity as well being at an age where girls start dating their classmates. She doesn't go to school, so there is no such possibility.) At the same time, Léon also turns into some kind of father figure to her. She looks up to him and also starts dressing more and more like him. Even if she seems very tough, there's a handful scenes where we see how immature and naive she really is, like when she tells the hotel worker that Léon is her lover or also her cartoon addiction or how she pours in the alcohol.The movie is at its most entertaining when the two go to work together. The scene with LaSardo (great actor) is pure gold and when they shoot the jogging politician from far away, it is also slightly special. Another funny comment by Léon is the ""hurry or he will never shut up"" after they run into gunshots. An emotional highlight is Mathilda's attempted suicide. She asks him what she is to him. He says nothing, yet contradicts himself by pulling the gun away in time. Almost a bit of a spoiler scene is when Léon tells Aiello's character to give Mathilda the money if something happens to him. One of the most intense scenes is when Stansfield and Mathilda meet in the bathroom. Edge-of-seat stuff and it shows that Stansfield is really scared of nothing, not even killing a girl in police headquarters. The possibly most beautiful camera shot of the film is when we see Léon and Mathilda reunited at one point and the camera shows us their feet. The last half hour is almost exclusively action sequences. I enjoyed these despite generally not being a great action movie fan. Maybe the reason is that you have made such a strong connection with the two protagonists at this point already. Oldman's way of handling the final act says a lot about him as well. He stays outside of the action to not put his own life in danger, but is a coward who prefers to shoot his victims in the back. When Léon hits the ground, it is a pretty sad moment (just like the farewell scene a couple minutes earlier) as we see it from his perspective. The film ends with Mathilda deciding to go back to school and a beautiful Sting song before the credits roll in.Wonderful movie, over two hours very much worth watching.",great film with one most memorable duos film history,l is 1994 movie written directed by luc besson named after its central character played by jean reno film went almost completely under radar terms awards recognition outside france but its reputation steadily rose over years it is now pretty much considered classic besson was his mid 30s when he made this movie but already had respectable r sum including french english version nikita reno oldman this is probably still most famous work not counting oldmans efforts batman movies portman it goes right along with other blockbusters like v vendetta black swan which gave her oscar i am still bit disappointed reno was not present at ceremony portman mathilda was first role movie also film is danny aiello as friend l his role wasnt clear early me as it seemed unsure what he was doing with money but as film went it showed that he was pretty close l film begins with introduction what l does he is contract killer who fact only wants little talk as we find out first sequence way he disappears into dark is pretty cool what is more sad than cool is one scene where l ons loneliness is displayed however when we see him theater he does not seem mind at all his face expression while watching movie is so much fun he is also milk junkie just like myself sadly i got no little girl that brings all this milk me there are many cult references closely connected with this film shades long coat piggy plant rootless like l nice quote chewing gum trick after intro portman oldman character name stansfield pill popping beethoven listening psychopath cop pretty much enter film at same time oldmans character is really scary even his colleagues fear him if you listen closely matildas dad only dares shout at stansfields partner malky not at him fact that oldman is not physically intimidating at all makes him even scarier as he must be complete nutcase if people three times his size fear him another little snippet one actors who play stansfields helpers died during terrorist attacks 9 11 during his work as firefighter seven years after movie when mathildas family is killed writers already gave it their best make them look as unlikeable as possible being very violent their daughter sister except very small one course its pretty sad when mathilda describes him as kid who only wanted cuddle however we also find out that her dad paid tuition fee one year advance so he cant be all bad i wondered about oldmans character why internal commission isnt getting worried if so many people that cross his way keep dying one my favorite scenes film is when mathilda returns with milk hears her family is dead knocks l ons door very intense moment with her begging going against his principles finally he lets her physically mentally into his life he becomes her mentor she becomes his housewife quickly develops some sexual tension quiz game example or talk about virginity as well being at age where girls start dating their classmates she doesnt go school so there is no such possibility at same time l also turns into some kind father figure her she looks up him also starts dressing more more like him even if she seems very tough theres handful scenes where we see how immature naive she really is like when she tells hotel worker that l is her lover or also her cartoon addiction or how she pours alcohol movie is at its most entertaining when two go work together scene with lasardo great actor is pure gold when they shoot jogging politician far away it is also slightly special another funny comment by l is hurry or he will never shut up after they run into gunshots emotional highlight is mathildas attempted suicide she asks him what she is him he says nothing yet contradicts himself by pulling gun away time almost bit spoiler scene is when l tells aiellos character give mathilda money if something happens him one most intense scenes is when stansfield mathilda meet bathroom edge seat stuff it shows that stansfield is really scared nothing not even killing girl police headquarters possibly most beautiful camera shot film is when we see l mathilda reunited at one point camera shows us their feet last half hour is almost

10,Unforgettable,"When I first watched this film at the cinema, I wasn't aware of IMDb. I've since watched it probably 4 or 5 times, and have recently bought the Directors Cut. Having used IMDb a lot recently, I checked out Leon. It was kind of heart warming, having a great deal of my memories of this movie from the previous 15 years being revisited upon me so eloquently whilst reading the comments.It is a glorious film. One that I've not been able to forget for all the best reasons. I think you could probably choose any sub category art that forms a movie i.e., editing or cinematography, and you'd be hard pushed to find fault. What makes this film Extra Special however, is the emotional 'ballet' taking place throughout the film. My emotions were pretty much assaulted by a gang of joy/sadness/hate/fearful anticipation/love/empathy/shock/horror/hope.It's one of those films.I adored/respected/loved Leon (I still watch nearly every film with Jean Reno in). I fell in love with Matilda. I've watched everyone of Natalie Portman's films since too.I was already a fan of Gary Oldman. This film just added extra glue to that bond. He made a brilliant sociopath, in direct contrast to Leon's (anti-)sociopath. I occasionally feel for a character (or two if it's a great romance), but it's very rare for me to be drawn into three so very different people's intimate lives so easily.It's a shame there are too few films of this calibre.",unforgettable,when i first watched this film at cinema i wasnt aware imdb ive since watched it probably 4 or 5 times have recently bought directors cut having used imdb lot recently i checked out leon it was kind heart warming having great deal my memories this movie previous 15 years being revisited upon me so eloquently whilst reading comments it is glorious film one that ive not been able forget all best reasons i think you could probably choose any sub category art that forms movie i e editing or cinematography youd be hard pushed find fault what makes this film extra special however is emotional ballet taking place throughout film my emotions were pretty much assaulted by gang joy sadness hate fearful anticipation love empathy shock horror hope its one those films i adored respected loved leon i still watch nearly every film with jean reno i fell love with matilda ive watched everyone natalie portmans films since too i was already fan gary oldman this film just added extra glue that bond he made brilliant sociopath direct contrast leons anti sociopath i occasionally feel character or two if its great romance but its very rare me be drawn into three so very different peoples intimate lives so easily its shame there are too few films this calibre,0.5477705627705628,0.2446103896103896,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.27}"
10,Matilda is cute,"Leon (Jean Reno) who is a professional killer opens the heart little by little to Matilda (Natalie Portman), the girl who aims at a professional killer for the revenge which had the younger brother killed. And Leon comes to have feeling. This movie contains all the elements have scenes with tension, calm scene, and the scene laughable. An action scene is impressive. Camera work is also wonderful. Fusion of showy action and true love calls big impression for the last scene. Even when you dislike an action film, since this work has the contents, I think that it is interesting for everyone. I was very impressed with the figure that Matilda is endure the sadness. Natalie's overwhelming presence of that time 13 years old is wonderful. Leon is good at teaching about how to use a weapon. However, he can't teach the other thing very well. I think this gap is one of a highlight.",matilda is cute,leon jean reno who is professional killer opens heart little by little matilda natalie portman girl who aims at professional killer revenge which had younger brother killed leon comes have feeling this movie contains all elements have scenes with tension calm scene scene laughable action scene is impressive camera work is also wonderful fusion showy action true love calls big impression last scene even when you dislike action film since this work has contents i think that it is interesting everyone i was very impressed with figure that matilda is endure sadness natalies overwhelming presence that time 13 years old is wonderful leon is good at teaching about how use weapon however he cant teach other thing very well i think this gap is one highlight,0.4862179487179486,0.2673076923076923,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.29}"
