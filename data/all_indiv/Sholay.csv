10.0,Awesome movie. My all time fave. The best villain in the history of bollywood.,"This movie is just one of the best Hindi movie i have seen. Its one of my favorite film. It has all the elements that a good Hindi movie must have. The settings of the hilly mountainous village, the dusty n tough terrain, the train sequence n the villain Gabbar played menacingly by Amjad Khan, were all awesome. Such is the impact of the villains acting is that u always remember him by his character's name frm the movie. One of the movies you remember for life. Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra were awesome too. The character of Hema malini was cheesy n unbelieavable though. A woman riding a horse chariot that too in the cow belt area wher rape is rampant. Nevertheles the film is solid entertainment. It is a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai & The Magnificent Seven with shades of Once uopn a time in the west.

8.0,The Magnificent Two Samurai...,"Epic in all proportions, a thoroughly entertaining wild east cowboyesque film fizzing with vengeance, violence and, for the time, visionary film making and performances.

10.0,Brilliant,"If you liked ""Once upon a time in the west"", ""The magnificent seven"" and ""A fistful of dollars"", you will love ""Sholay"". It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest ""curry"" westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the ""spaghetti"" westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after.

,No arguments.,"No film before or after Sholay has achieved as much - running to full houses in an unbroken 6 year stretch! Consider the fact that this happened in India - where the audiences have the most choices amongst all the people of the world. Consider the fact that no movie anywhere in the world has been able to reap even half this success that Sholay enjoys.It is potent, does not pretend, and has clearly been made with courage and conviction. It was made for the enjoyment of its predominantly Indian, fun-loving audiences, so my dear detractors from the clan of the perennially cynical, reality-fed, fun deprived masses of the world, kindly excuse yourselves. Sholay is quintessential Mumbai produce - you either consume and enjoy in total acceptance, or you're not fit for the ride. It is as simple as that.The world would be a poorer place without films like Sholay, not only because of the almost arrogant instantaneous and total suspension of disbelief it demands from its audiences, but because of the honesty and sheer power of that demand. You go to a boxing match to see two boxers fight it out, not to see them playing chess in the middle of the ring!Sholay will always be an incredible and shining example of purity, because it was the purest attempt made to entertain, with absolutely no quarters even considered for critical acclaim from the so called pundits of cinema.Yours truly is guilty of seeing this film 23 times to date, 17 of these in the theatres. And if opportunity allows, I wouldn't mind being sentenced to death with more of this guilt delightfully added to my conscience.As with any other film, there have been many comments on what is wrong with Sholay. To these, here is my personal quote - ""A good film is about getting most things right, not about getting the fewest things wrong!""And here is my response to other heartless comments on Sholay being a copy of some other film or filmmaker's work - ""If every human was an original, we would have 6 billion different species without a single one to call friend or family"".To argue against failure may be human, but to argue against success is sub-human.

10.0,SHOLAY the pride of Indian Cinema,"Sholay is an action movie directed by Ramesh Sippy and stars Dharmendra, Late Sanjeev Kumar, Hema Malini, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Late Amjad Khan, Late Satyen Kappu, Late A.K. Hangal and Late Mac Mohan. Asrani, Late Keshto Mukherjee, Late Viju Khote, Late Leela Mishra, Late Iftekhar, Late Jalal Agha and Helen were in supporting but pivotal roles.Before going down kindly be informed that this is not a review. It's a feeling expressed by a fan. I am in no capacity to review this masterpiece.The movie itself is a brand and still carries the same charm when it was released. The movie has lots of stories and trivia behind it such as casting of Amjad Khan in place of Danny. Slow pace of the movie in the initial week of it's release and so on and I think every movie buff must have read, heard or read about it.The movie is known for the best execution of a predictable plot with a seasoning of comedy and emotion. All most all the characters of the movie is a legend in fact the side characters are also immortal now be it 'Mausi', 'Angrezo ke zamane ke jailer', 'Soorma Bhopali', 'Kalia'or 'Sambha'.Probably this is the only movie who might have given birth to lots of parodies and those parodies are still in making.The mesmerising songs which suits every occasion such as beautiful 'Holi' song, the song representing the eternal bond of friendship or to please your love interest, and yes the dialogues which we all would have copied in all the funnier situations like 'Itna sannata kyun hai bhai', 'kitne aadmi the' and so onWith immortal characters and dialogues Sholay is a classic which can't be created and in fact will never be created.",sholay pride indian cinema,sholay is action movie directed by ramesh sippy stars dharmendra late sanjeev kumar hema malini amitabh bachchan jaya bachchan late amjad khan late satyen kappu late k hangal late mac mohan asrani late keshto mukherjee late viju khote late leela mishra late iftekhar late jalal agha helen were supporting but pivotal roles before going down kindly be informed that this is not review its feeling expressed by fan i am no capacity review this masterpiece movie itself is brand still carries same charm when it was released movie has lots stories trivia behind it such as casting amjad khan place danny slow pace movie initial week its release so i think every movie buff must have read heard or read about it movie is known best execution predictable plot with seasoning comedy emotion all most all characters movie is legend fact side characters are also immortal now be it mausi angrezo ke zamane ke jailer soorma bhopali kaliaor sambha probably this is only movie who might have given birth lots parodies those parodies are still making mesmerising songs which suits every occasion such as beautiful holi song song representing eternal bond friendship or please your love interest yes dialogues which we all would have copied all funnier situations like itna sannata kyun hai bhai kitne aadmi so onwith immortal characters dialogues sholay is classic which cant be created fact will never be created,0.5225198412698412,0.014682539682539702,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.43, 'Fear': 0.3}"
8.0,A rare Hindi film of the times,"I think Sholay is a great Hindi film of its times, although with the amount of praise and superlatives it has been getting throughout the years, I must admit it's a little overrated. The film was indeed ahead of its time in many ways. First, the action was really good - there were some glitches here and there, but it was far more credible than what the times had set the public for. Secondly, the attention to detail, as expected from Ramesh Sippy, is first-rate. Sippy, a great director whose combination of professional, technically skilled direction, impressive storytelling, and the delicate yet honest depiction of his stories, produced several classic Hindi pictures. Sholay is a good product although sadly it mixes too many genres and is overlong for the story it tells. It could have easily edited out some parts. Given the extraordinary brutality of the villainous characters and the situations, as well as the marked contrast between the good and the evil, I think the comedic parts (except for those of Basanti) were grossly redundant, among others, as they dragged the narrative and undermined its consistency as well as the minimalist approach that was so successfully employed by Sippy in some key scenes.Set in a rural, remote region in southern India, the film is beautifully shot, and Sippy manages to capture the essence of the village and its people. One wonderful scene shows the routine of the village and the different activities of its inhabitants in the morning, a rare glimpse into the cultural weight of the place, which few directors would bother to tap into. This is where our heroes and villains are thrown, in an interesting story which benefits from Sippy's unique direction. The realism with which some of the situations are portrayed is striking, and it is matched by a careful handling of the proceedings in ways the Indian moviegoing public, which was used to being spoonfed by Hindi filmmakers, had not been accustomed to. Note for one the way the romance between Veeru and Radha is portrayed. Just watch the scene in which Jai is playing his harmonica as Radha is walking around and turning off the Kerosene lamps. Such subtlety is rarely seen in Hindi films. This is not to say that the film is devoid of any sentimentality. Still, the overall thing is really good - the film is both entertaining and then it is also quite moving and heartbreaking in some hard-hitting scenes, not to mention the famous, harrowing parts.The film's authenticity is achieved in large parts through the acting, particularly the grounded, authentic performances of the main characters. Sholay is in my view Sanjeev Kumar's story as it is his character's determination that carries the narrative forward. He is tremendous. Dharmendra plays the energetic and happy-go-lucky Veeru pretty well, but Bachchan is fantastic in a subdued, quiet performance as Jai. Hema Malini is wonderful as the iconic, highly talkative and kind-hearted village belle Basanti; her comic timing is top-notch, and her dance numbers are never less than fabulous. Out of the two couple, it is Jaya Bhaduri of course who can always be trusted to do so much by doing so little. Her quietly understated performance is one of the film's assets, the other one being Amjad Khan's phenomenal turn as one of the greatest screen villains of Hindi cinema. Sholay is greatly aided by the great background score which enhances some of the most difficult scenes and helps alleviate others. R. D. Burman's soundtrack is as memorable as the film. Sholay is definitely a classic in many ways. It is not flawless, nor do I think it matters. In many ways it is a landmark film, and I'm sure non-Indians might enjoy it just as much.",rare hindi film times,i think sholay is great hindi film its times although with amount praise superlatives it has been getting throughout years i must admit its little overrated film was indeed ahead its time many ways first action was really good there were some glitches here there but it was far more credible than what times had set public secondly attention detail as expected ramesh sippy is first rate sippy great director whose combination professional technically skilled direction impressive storytelling delicate yet honest depiction his stories produced several classic hindi pictures sholay is good product although sadly it mixes too many genres is overlong story it tells it could have easily edited out some parts given extraordinary brutality villainous characters situations as well as marked contrast between good evil i think comedic parts except those basanti were grossly redundant among others as they dragged narrative undermined its consistency as well as minimalist approach that was so successfully employed by sippy some key scenes set rural remote region southern india film is beautifully shot sippy manages capture essence village its people one wonderful scene shows routine village different activities its inhabitants morning rare glimpse into cultural weight place which few directors would bother tap into this is where our heroes villains are thrown interesting story which benefits sippys unique direction realism with which some situations are portrayed is striking it is matched by careful handling proceedings ways indian moviegoing public which was used being spoonfed by hindi filmmakers had not been accustomed note one way romance between veeru radha is portrayed just watch scene which jai is playing his harmonica as radha is walking around turning off kerosene lamps such subtlety is rarely seen hindi films this is not say that film is devoid any sentimentality still overall thing is really good film is both entertaining then it is also quite moving heartbreaking some hard hitting scenes not mention famous harrowing parts films authenticity is achieved large parts through acting particularly grounded authentic performances main characters sholay is my view sanjeev kumars story as it is his characters determination that carries narrative forward he is tremendous dharmendra plays energetic happy go lucky veeru pretty well but bachchan is fantastic subdued quiet performance as jai hema malini is wonderful as iconic highly talkative kind hearted village belle basanti her comic timing is top notch her dance numbers are never less than fabulous out two couple it is jaya bhaduri course who can always be trusted do so much by doing so little her quietly understated performance is one films assets other one being amjad khans phenomenal turn as one greatest screen villains hindi cinema sholay is greatly aided by great background score which enhances some most difficult scenes helps alleviate others r d burmans soundtrack is as memorable as film sholay is definitely classic many ways it is not flawless nor do i think it matters many ways it is landmark film im sure non indians might enjoy it just as much,0.5835927632701826,0.2746338965693804,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.33}"

10.0,The Greatest Story Ever Told!,"""Kitne Aadmi Thei"", every Indian film fan knows this dialog by heart. Sholay was released in 1975, also the year I was born in, coincidence, perhaps. The film became the longest running Indian film in the theaters, a record that stood for over 25 years until it was broken recently by another classic ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (holds the current record 500 Weeks and still going - as on May 07, 2005).Sholay was written by the great Duo of Javed Akhtar and Salim Khan know as Salim-Javed. The duo also gave us films like Don, Shakti, Shaan, Zanjeer, Seeta Aur Geeta and Deewar. The film was directed by Ramesh Sippy and had music of legendary R.D. Burman. Sholay gave us a Character called ""Gabbar Singh"" played by Amjad Khan, who made his debut with this film. The character of Gabbar Singh is so creative that many film makers have tried to imitate him for their films.Sholay did for Indian Cinema what Casablanca did for Hollywood. It became an instant classic and broke all the rules of film making and characterization, while preserving the values of Indian cinema.Sholay just won the Filmfare Award (2005) for being the Best Film in the last 50 years of Indian Cinema. Sadly, when Sholay was first released in 1975 it didn't win any major Filmfare awards. But when you think about all the great films that were released in that year, its easy to see how it may have been over looked. 1975 may have been the best year for Hindi films with the likes of Deewar, Chupke Chupke, Hera Pheri, Khel Khel Mein, Julie, Mausam, Ponga Pandit, Rafoo Chakkar, Uljhan, Dharmatma, Do Jasoos, Faraar, Geet Gaata Chal, Chhoti Si Baat, Aandhi and Milli - all releasing along with Sholay.Sholay had the biggest star cast of its time with the likes of Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri, Sanjeev Kumar, Sachin, A.K.

7.0,Sholay,"I have only seen a few Bollywood movies, including The Apu Trilogy (Pather Panchali, Aparajito, and The World of Apu), Mother India, and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (The Brave Hearted Will Take the Bride), I am happy to find them occasionally. I had mainly heard of this Hindi film (Sholay means ""embers"" in Hindi) because of one of the leading actors in it, it was rated well and sounded like something I would enjoy. Basically, in the small village of Ramgarh, former police chief Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) wants to find a pair of small-time thieves he had once arrested. A flashback shows that these petty criminals, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan), attempted a train robbery, before helping the Thakur fight off a gang of more dangerous bandits. After these bandits were successfully defeated, the Thakur was wounded and was unconscious, Veeru wanted to leave him for dead and escape, but Jai wanted to help him and consequently go to jail, they called a coin toss, and Jai won. After recollecting this experience, Shakur explains to his colleague that they Veeru and Jai would be the ideal men to help him capture Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan), a man wanted by the authorities for a reward of 50,000 rupees. Veeru and Jai have been in and out of various jails and are currently being held in a prison run by a comedic Jailor (Asrani). The two jailbirds get the opportunity to escape and drive away in a motorbike with sidecar. They are found and caught and brought to Ramgarh. They are told by the Thakur that they are to bring Gabbar to him alive for 20,000 rupees plus the 50,000 rupees reward, to which they agree. Soon enough, three of Gabbar's enforcers arrive to collect supplies from the defenceless villagers. Veeru and Jai thwart the bandits and they leave emptyhanded. The villagers show their gratitude by hailing their new heroes. Gabbar questions how the three men were defeated by only two men. He plays a twisted game of Russian Roulette, he and the others are bemused to survive, with none of the three bullets firing from the gun. Gabbar laughs uncontrollably at the bizarre occurrence, and all his men join in, until suddenly stops laughing and uses the three remaining bullets to shoot the three men dead. Gabbar and his men return to the village to attack during the festival of Holi, Veeru and Jai meet their match and are held at gunpoint. There is a moment when the Thakur has a chance to throw a gun to Veeru, but he simply stands stationary. With quick thinking, Veeru and Jai manage to save their lives and Gabbar and his gang flee. The two recruits accuse the Thakur of being a coward, until the former police officer reveals the truth of why he wants Gabbar and why he could not help them, he has no arms. A flashback reveals that years ago the Thakur had caught Gabbar and had him imprisoned. But Gabbar escapes and plotted an evil revenge against him. Gabbar made his way to the Thakur's home and cold-bloodedly, killed his two sons, daughter, daughter-in-law, and his only grandson. The only survivor of the family massacre was the Thakur's younger daughter-in-law, Radha (Jaya Bachchan). The Thakur was later captured and tortured by Gabbar, who tied him up, and with two swords, Gabbar maniacally and ruthlessly amputated both his arms. Living in Ramgarh, the cynical young Jai and lively Veeru grow fond of the villagers, taking pity on their sufferings under Gabbar's tyranny. Veeru is attracted to Basanti (Hema Malini), a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living driving a horse-cart but finds him annoying. Jai is drawn to Radha, the Thakur's reclusive widowed daughter-in-law, who very subtly returns his affections. There is another attack by Gabbar's henchmen, who kill Ahmed (Sachin Pilgaonkar), the son of the blind Imaam Saheb (A. K. Hangal). The Thakur, Veeru and Jai argue against the villagers surrendering to Gabbar's threats, but the imam convinces them that they cannot simply give in to evil. Veeru and Jai send a threatening message to Gabbar. Wanting to get closer to Basanti, Veeru tricks her into thinking the statue of their lord is speaking to her while praying. She is angered when Jai shows Veeru tricking her, and she rides away with her horse and cart, but he follows her and she slowly forgives him, and they finally embrace. Later, Gabbar is angered by the message, and kidnaps Veeru and Basanti. Gabbar has Veeru tied up and forces Basanti to dance, saying he will kill him if she stops. She slowly tires from the heat of the sun, and Gabbar smashes glass on the ground which cut her feet, causing them to bleed, but desperate to save Veeru, who she truly does have feelings for, she does not give up. Eventually, Jai shoots at the bandits from a distance with a rifle, allowing Veeru and Basanti to escape. Once Veeru and Basanti are safe, Jai runs away, only to be wounded by a bullet. Veeru finds and does not want Jai to face the bandits alone, but Jai orders him to go back to the village, so they have a coin toss, and Jai wins. Jai, slowly dying and with only a few bullets, manages to fend off advances by the bandits, and gets close enough to detonate an unexploded stick of dynamite to take out the bridge and most of Gabbar's men. Veeru returns to find Jai dying and sadly talks with him before he dies in his arms. Shortly after, Veeru notices Jai's old coin in his hand and then it dawns on him that he had been tricked by Jai all along. The coin was double-headed, and Jai had managed to manipulate every situation that they disagreed on to his favour. Angry at his friend for sacrificing his life to save him, Veeru becomes hell-bent on revenge and goes after Gabbar. Veeru catches Gabbar and beats him up badly, but before he can kill him, the Thakur appears and reminds him of the promise to bring Gabbar in alive. Veeru is ready to avenge Jai, but it was Jai's promise, which he is unwilling to break, so Veeru hands Gabbar over to the Thakur. Gabbar is severely injured, and his hands are destroyed by the Thakur useing his spike-soled shoes. The police then arrive and arrest Gabbar. After Jai's funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train, while Radha watches on through a window. Also starring Satyendra Kapoor as Ramlal, and Iftekhar as Narmalaji, Radha's father. Dharmendra is good-natured and likeable, Bachchan is tough and reliable, Kumar is interesting as the disabled formerly courageous cop, and Khan makes an impact as the psychopathic villain. The song and dance sequences that stand out are: ""Yeh Dosti Hum Nahin Todhenge"" (We Will Never Break Our Friendship), ""Mehbooba Mehbooba"", ""Koi Haseena Jab Rooth Jaati"" (When a Girl Gets Angry), and ""Jab Tak Hain Jaan"" (As Long as There Is Life). It is a long film, but the mix of genres together, including spaghetti western (""curry western"" if you like lol), romance, comedy and musical, keep you watching, an entertaining Indian action adventure.

9.0,It has assimilated with the Indian folklore,"In the Indian mythological epic - Ramayan, Sage Vishwamitra asks King Dashrath for his sons - Ram and Lakshman to take on the might of the evil demons, creating havoc in the pious forests inhabited by the saints and finally the twosome kills all the evil ones, restoring peace and Dharma once again.Millenniums later, in the celluloid era, a movie was made in Japan - Seven Samurai (1954) which portrayed the story of a veteran Samurai (Japanese militaryman) taking six others with him to get the better of a dangerous bandit which is synonymous with terror in his village. This story inspired many Indian cine-script writers to make its Bollywoodish versions which came in the form of Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971), Khote Sikkay (1974), Karma (1986), Army (1996), China Gate (1998), Keemat (1998) etc. However the most impactful of the Indianized versions of Seven Samurai is definitely - Sholay (1975) which was written by the high-profile cine-script writers, Salim-Javed. Though they had taken inspiration from Seven Samurai, yet, by default, Sholay turned out, not at all a shadow of these or any other movie on similar lines. It developed an identity of its own and became a legendary movie of the Indian cinema.Sholay (flames) is based on the theme of the revenge-seeking mission of an ex-copThakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) whose all family members but for himself and his young daughter-in-law, Radha (Jaya Bhaduri) have been killed by the dangerous dacoit - Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) who has deprived him of his hands too. Handicapped Thakur seeks the help of two petty thieves - Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jay (Amitabh Bachchan) who visit his village, Ramgarh only to earn money in return of helping him. However knowledge of the truth transforms their hearts and they fight tooth and nail with the bandit and his gang, Jay loses his life in this mission whereas Veeru gains the love of his life in the form of Basanti (Hema Malini).It is said that good pieces are made through hard, sincere and planned work but masterpieces are born by default. The same thing has happened to Sholay. It's a masterpiece by default and not by deliberate effort. The screenplay contains many loopholes and its definitely over-dramatic, devoid of the naturalness to a large extent. Still it keeps the viewer hooked. In fact, had the story been portrayed naturally, perhaps it would not have been able to be considered a masterpiece. The over-the-top nature of the picturization alongwith comic and witty dialogues (and their memorable delivery) is something which makes this entertaining movie nor only more entertaining but also an unforgettable experience for the viewer. This only provides unmeasurable repeat value to this movie. No surprise that several spectators have watched it dozens of times.There are two major plus points of this movie adding spice to its already high entertainment value - 1. The mannerisms of the villain, Gabbar Singh and his theatrical dialogue delivery, 2. The comedy generated by Veeru, Basanti, Jay and some insignificant characters like the Jailer of the British times (Asrani) and Soorma Bhopali (Jagdeep). The scene of Veeru climbing up the water tank in a drunken state, threatening to commit suicide and demanding the hand of Basanti in marriage, is definitely the best comedy scene of Dharmendra's career.Sholay is just like a dish in every ingredient and every required spice is just optimum, making it a highly delicious one rendering the eater a taste to remember forever. And that taste is such that it draws the eater again and again towards the dish. It's not a realistic movie about the bandits of India. It's an entertaining movie, providing wholesome entertainment through the activities of the characters who may not be found in this world. I consider Sholay as the biggest fantasy whose unique characteristic is that apparently it does not render the look of a fantasy.Director Ramesh Sippy has directed the movie well despite loopholes and inconsistencies which are overlooked by us because we are mesmerized by the entertainment we get through the narrative. Technical and production value aspects are quite high despite the fact that almost the whole story takes place in the rural setting. Music by R.D. Burman is quite OK, neither excellent, nor bad. The biggest strength of the movie is the dialogues, especially the dialogues of the villain, Gabbar Singh. These dialogues alongwith Gabbar Singh, his sidekick - Saambha (played by Mac Mohan) and a member of his gang - Kaalia (played by Viju Khote) have become so popular that now they are a part of the Indian folklore. Who can forget - 'Arre O Saambha' and 'Tera Kya Hoga Kaaliya'.The high-profile star cast of Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bhaduri has excelled in the roles assigned. Everybody gets full marks for the underplay (Amitabh, Jaya and Sanjeev) and overplay (Dharmendra-Hema) as required by the situation in the scene. Asrani has been given the get-up of Hitler in his completely over-the-top role of Angrezon Ke Zamaane Ka Jailer (the Jailer of the British times) but he and others like him generate laughters as demanded by their roles. Leela Mishra, A.K. Hangal, Sachin etc. also leave their mark in their cameos. And finally, it's Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) who has become immortal because of this movie. Never in the history of cinema, a villain had amassed so much popularity which overtook the popularity of the hero / heroes. Amjad Khan never got such a role in his career again and also could never come out of the hangover of this role. Gabbar Singh with his mannerisms has become a legend.Sholay is a movie in which the negatives also turned out to be the positives and everything just fell in place to render it a class of its own. It has been re-released many times and the Indian folklore has absorbed it.",it has assimilated with indian folklore,indian mythological epic ramayan sage vishwamitra asks king dashrath his sons ram

10.0,Sholay is immortal.,"Sholay review :15th August 1975. The day Ramesh Sippy's magnum opus Sholay released at the Minerva cinema, Mumbai.Undoubtedly, this film doesn't need a review. We all know Sholay and we all love Sholay. It is a benchmark in Indian cinema and each one of us has his own story to tell about the classic. From seeing it more than 50 times to purchasing ticket in black for an obscene amount or memorising every dialogue, personal stories around the legendary film abound.I first experienced the Sholay phenomenon in the year 1985 during Diwali time when I visited my paternal grandparents place at Mahim. The society had hired a huge screen and projector to film it in its premise. The euphoria at the time of screening with loud ceetes and people mouthing dialogues along with the characters and dancing during the songs is a moment I will never forget ever.I have seen the movie multiple times later on VHS (during video cassette era) and on DVD. It is a regular on satellite channels also where I still catch it whenever possible.Recently in 2014, the film re-released in 3D format and I took my family to watch it. That was actually my first theatrical viewing of Sholay. I have preserved its ticket stub to show my future generation that I was amongst that lucky generation which got to see Sholay in theatres.One unfulfilled wish in my life is not able to watch Sholay at the iconic Minerva cinema in Mumbai where it ran continuously for 5 years from 1975 to 1980. The film enjoyed multiple re-runs in this iconic theatre right till 2004.Infact, I had almost made it when Sholay re- released at the Minerva in 2004. The theatre was playing Sholay in matinee and 'Kyun Ho Gaya Na' for regular 3 shows. When I reached the theatre for the matinee show, it was housefull and I didnt get the tickets for Sholay (The black ticket rates were too exorbitant for me). Surprisingly, a new release like 'Kyun Ho Gaya Na' was playing to empty seats while Sholay was sold out for the entire week. I returned home disappointed. Will always envy those fortunate who watched Sholay at Minerva!Movies will come and go....but Sholay is immortal.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni",sholay is immortal,sholay review 15th august 1975 day ramesh sippys magnum opus sholay released at minerva cinema mumbai undoubtedly this film doesnt need review we all know sholay we all love sholay it is benchmark indian cinema each one us has his own story tell about classic seeing it more than 50 times purchasing ticket black obscene amount or memorising every dialogue personal stories around legendary film abound i first experienced sholay phenomenon year 1985 during diwali time when i visited my paternal grandparents place at mahim society had hired huge screen projector film it its premise euphoria at time screening with loud ceetes people mouthing dialogues along with characters dancing during songs is moment i will never forget ever i have seen movie multiple times later vhs during video cassette era dvd it is regular satellite channels also where i still catch it whenever possible recently 2014 film re released 3d format i took my family watch it that was actually my first theatrical viewing sholay i have preserved its ticket stub show my future generation that i was amongst that lucky generation which got see sholay theatres one unfulfilled wish my life is not able watch sholay at iconic minerva cinema mumbai where it ran continuously 5 years 1975 1980 film enjoyed multiple re runs this iconic theatre right till 2004 infact i had almost made it when sholay re released at minerva 2004 theatre was playing sholay matinee kyun ho gaya na regular 3 shows when i reached theatre matinee show it was housefull i didnt get tickets sholay black ticket rates were too exorbitant me surprisingly new release like kyun ho gaya na was playing empty seats while sholay was sold out entire week i returned home disappointed will always envy those fortunate who watched sholay at minerva movies will come go but sholay is immortal regards sumeet nadkarni,0.48340724931634027,0.17541650268922998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.32}"
,Reviewing the 2014 3D theatrical version for now,"Some of the most pathetic conversion from 2D-3D available on screen, that puts the shoddy 'Clash of the Titans' on a pedestal for how to do things. The wonderful original background score has also been screwed-with (thankfully, not to a great extent) by someone called Raju Singh. Atmos sound works most of the time. Better viewed in 2D, and I shall remedy the mistake when/if I get the chance, though I'd have to live with the screwed-over score in any case (I think).Having said that, the audience members who watched this one when I did, had the following attributes: 1. Intent in capturing selfies during the movie's running time. Cams pointed right at the audience as well, flashes going off to the tune of 5-10 occasions every half hour. 2. Babies, who (obviously) brought the house down with the (oh so pleasant) screaming when Atmos accentuated every gunshot, every death-scream, and every swear word. 3. Cam phones once again, being used by geniuses to take snaps of the (3D) images on screen. Wait, there's more... 4. Cacophonous laughs and jeers at every quite moment, some of which were romantic, most of which were tragic/poignant. Same batch of geniuses (see above) joining in, with quite a few followers to boot......Now, in spite of not blowing a blood vessel at all that (quite used to putting up with, nee living with, said geniuses that populate most cinemas, including multiplexes), I confess to having not felt bored even during (what I consider the weakest element of this masterpiece) those interminable flashbacks, and dated-looking/sounding/seeming scenarios on display. The performances are still top-notch, the music plays a huge role (the not-too-destroyed RDB-original score during the train sequence being a case-in-point - the rest having been butchered by Raju Singh). All-in-all, I do hope someone coverts this for IMAX (hopefully, without the 3D), or someone updates the 3D sometime, even with crowd-funding, if that's an option. Still, this compares well against most of the other trash playing, and being appreciated, out there.",reviewing 2014 3d theatrical version now,some most pathetic conversion 2d 3d available screen that puts shoddy clash titans pedestal how do things wonderful original background score has also been screwed with thankfully not great extent by someone called raju singh atmos sound works most time better viewed 2d i shall remedy mistake when if i get chance though id have live with screwed over score any case i think having said that audience members who watched this one when i did had following attributes 1 intent capturing selfies during movies running time cams pointed right at audience as well flashes going off tune 5 10 occasions every half hour 2 babies who obviously brought house down with oh so pleasant screaming when atmos accentuated every gunshot every death scream every swear word 3 cam phones once again being used by geniuses take snaps 3d images screen wait theres more 4 cacophonous laughs jeers at every quite moment some which were romantic most which were tragic poignant same batch geniuses see above joining with quite few followers boot now spite not blowing blood vessel at all that quite used putting up with nee living with said geniuses that populate most cinemas including multiplexes i confess having not felt bored even during what i consider weakest element this masterpiece those interminable flashbacks dated looking sounding seeming scenarios display performances are still top notch music plays huge role not too destroyed rdb original score during train sequence being case point rest having been butchered by raju singh all all i do hope someone coverts this imax hopefully without 3d or someone updates 3d sometime even with crowd funding if thats option still this compares well against most other trash playing being appreciated out there,0.5102267573696146,0.12309111523397238,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"

10.0,A True Masterpiece!,"Ramesh Sippy's 'Sholay' is Amongst The Great Cinematic Moments in The History of Film. An Outstanding Motion-Picture, that oozes perfection & flamboyance. A True Masterpiece, that re-defined Hindi Cinema!'Sholay' Synopsis: After his family is murdered by a notorious and ruthless bandit, a former police officer enlists the services of two outlaws to capture him.'Sholay' is an Outstanding Motion-Picture. I've seen this Masterstroke a number of times & I can't get enough of it. Salim-Javed's Screenplay is a Milestone. The Script is Super-Strong, The Characters are Mesmerizing & The Narrative is Magnificent. The film runs for a 190-Minutes, but not a single moment does the momentum come down. In fact, the film gets bigger & grander with each passing scene. Ramesh Sippy's Direction is Fantastic. He executes this unforgettable story, with magnetic ease. Cinematography is fabulous. Editing is razor-sharp. Music by R. D. Burman, is legendary. Performance-Wise: Amjad Khan as Gabbar Singh, delivers an astonishing performance. He makes Gabbar, the most despicable villain you'd ever see on the big screen. Sanjeev Kumar as Thakur, is flawless, as always. Amitabh Bachchan as Jai & Dharmendra as Veeru, are heroic & extremely competent. Hema Malini as Basanti, is lovable. Jaya Bachchan as Radha, is graceful.

,one of the greatest Hindi ever made !,"This movie has everything, comedy, action, drama, romance, fun, emotions. Great performance by all the characters. They are remembered even today in 2004 after nearly 30 years of the film release. I heard that this movie is now re-released with remastered sound. wow ! cant' wait to fetch the DVD of this remastered version.The most impressive role of Gabbar by Amjad Khan was portrayed extremely well. Its also one the longest movie. Its quite normal for bollywood movies to be 3 hours long. But this one is even longer than this. But certainly ever minute of the movie is enjoyable.This movie is my all time favorite.",one greatest hindi ever made,this movie has everything comedy action drama romance fun emotions great performance by all characters they are remembered even today 2004 after nearly 30 years film release i heard that this movie is now re released with remastered sound wow cant wait fetch dvd this remastered version most impressive role gabbar by amjad khan was portrayed extremely well its also one longest movie its quite normal bollywood movies be 3 hours long but this one is even longer than this but certainly ever minute movie is enjoyable this movie is my all time favorite,0.638095238095238,0.36595238095238103,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.2}"
10.0,The Definitive Masterpiece...,"As a strong fan of the American Western genre and of course the directing of Sergio Leone, it is with great enthusiasm that i recommend Sholay to any audiences or fans of Westerns and Bollywood cinema.Perhaps, the greatest film in the history of Bollywood cinema (with one of the longest theatrical runs in Bollywood history), this is the definitive Bollywood action epic movie in the same way that Leone's 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' was the definitive Western.The film features the acting talents of such Bollywood legends...Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra and focuses at its heart, a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai & The Magnificent Seven.If you have not watched it, then make it your priority to watch it at least once in your life, as this is definitely one of the movies that every person needs to experience.A true cinematic masterpiece.",definitive masterpiece,as strong fan american western genre course directing sergio leone it is with great enthusiasm that i recommend sholay any audiences or fans westerns bollywood cinema perhaps greatest film history bollywood cinema with one longest theatrical runs bollywood history this is definitive bollywood action epic movie same way that leones good bad ugly was definitive western film features acting talents such bollywood legends amitabh bachan dharmendra focuses at its heart story friendship courage revenge based loosely around concepts akira kurosawas seven samurai magnificent seven if you have not watched it then make it your priority watch it at least once your life as this is definitely one movies that every person needs experience true cinematic masterpiece,0.4235347985347985,0.12887667887667892,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,Great Movie... Everyone should have seen this movie at least one time !,"Great Movie... Everyone should have seen this movie at least one time ! I bought this movie on DVD now, although I am not a big fan of elder films... i love this film, and especially the dialogs of GB ! For all Amitabh fans its a must have movie ! The whole story is really good and the movie has a flair of an American western. Even the sound of Sholay and the atmosphere which is given to the watcher are one of the best i have seen in Bollywood. I have heard, there will be a remake of this film, but I think it could not be as good as the original Sholay. All because of the actors like Amjad Khan who was born for this role. This film is one of bollywood's best movies ever.",great movie everyone should have seen this movie at least one time,great movie everyone should have seen this movie at least one time i bought this movie dvd now although i am not big fan elder films i love this film especially dialogs gb all amitabh fans its must have movie whole story is really good movie has flair american western even sound sholay atmosphere which is given watcher are one best i have seen bollywood i have heard there will be remake this film but i think it could not be as good as original sholay all because actors like amjad khan who was born this role this film is one bollywoods best movies ever,0.45937500000000003,0.3671875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.36, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.36, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.14}"
10.0,A very enjoyable movie,"I didn't think much of Sholay till I actually saw it. I can understand why it's so famous.First of all...the acting! Ah! Just wonderful.Dharmendra plays the hero, who is basically comical...even while he's getting arrested. I mean, his jokes are just hilarious! And those funny faces he makes! I couldn't stop laughing! Then there's his best friend, who is played by Amitabh. Though Amitabh is not as goofy as his friend, he is funny. He makes all sarcastic comments and you can see why he shot into superstardom with his performance. Though I never thought Hema Malini was a good actress...trust me, in this movie she is sooooo funny. The girl just can't stop talking! The scenes with Dharmendra and her are really funny. Then of course there's Jaya Bhaduri, who is more of the depressed type, and her and Amitabh fall in love just by sharing glances, it's awfully cute. Her gloomy look is very effective.Let's not forget Sanjeev Kumar, a good strong performance. He makes a dark voice that really adds effect on his character. At first he seems heartless, but later you realize that he does really care.The only performance that was not so good was Amjad Khan's, though many liked it. His stupid accent was not very enjoyable and it seemed like he was trying to get bhojpuri into his dialect when he shouldn't have been.So there are cons in this movie...the violence is not very good. I mean, I enjoy fist fights, but there's only one in this movie and the rest in like gun shots...which I think is boring. The music could've been much better. The only good songs are ""Haan Jab Tak"" and the other one that's okay was ""Holi Ke Din"". I think if Ramesh Sippy had taken someone like Laxmikant Pyarelal, the music would've been much much better.The beginning is really funny, Asrani as the overacting jailor is hilarious. The movie is very touching at the end though, very sad I'll have to say. Even though I'm telling you all the cons in the movie, I'm not saying that you shouldn't watch it...because you should! After watching this movie Dharmendra and Amitabh have become my favorite actors. It's a great movie, even though I have some stuff against it, because of the comedy and performances...I'll have to give it a ten out of ten.",very enjoyable movie,i didnt think much sholay till i actually saw it i can understand why its so famous first all acting ah just wonderful dharmendra plays hero who is basically comical even while hes getting arrested i mean his jokes are just hilarious those funny faces he makes i couldnt stop laughing then theres his best friend who is played by amitabh though amitabh is not as goofy as his friend he is funny he makes all sarcastic comments you can see why he shot into superstardom with his performance though i never thought hema malini was good actress trust me this movie she is sooooo funny girl just cant stop talking scenes with dharmendra her are really funny then course theres jaya bhaduri who is more depressed type her amitabh fall love just by sharing glances its awfully cute her gloomy look is very effective lets not forget sanjeev kumar good strong performance he makes dark voice that really adds effect his character at first he seems heartless but later you realize that he does really care only performance that was not so good was amjad khans though many liked it his stupid accent was not very enjoyable it seemed like he was trying get bhojpuri into his dialect when he shouldnt have been so there are cons this movie violence is not very good i mean i enjoy fist fights but theres only one this movie rest like gun shots which i think is boring music couldve been much better only good songs are haan jab tak other one thats okay was holi ke din i think if ramesh sippy had taken someone like laxmikant pyarelal music wouldve been much much better beginning is really funny asrani as overacting jailor is hilarious movie is very touching at end though very sad ill have say even though im telling you all cons movie im not saying that you shouldnt watch it because you should after watching this movie dharmendra amitabh have become my favorite actors its great movie even though i have some stuff against it because comedy performances ill have give it ten out ten,0.6652335164835165,0.23663919413919404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.1}"
9.0,MY REVIEW: The Ageless Bollywoodish Entertainer!!,"As said by a critic; 3D, 2D or no D, Sholay is still D for Delicious. It's an ageless entertainer made from all bollywoodish ingredients; Songs, dance, melodrama, dialogs etc. But make no mistake, there is undeniably excellent storytelling, well developed characters, an engaging emotional script with ample scope of ruthless action, sincere performances by all lead actors, first rate background score and technically apt direction. For nitpicking, you can say that more than 3 hours is too long and few scenes could have been edited but the charm of this movie is too magnetic that even after 38 years, it is able to fill half of the seats of the theater on its re-release. I may not agree that this is the greatest story ever told but yes it is the finest commercial effort till date by Bollywood. For those who have doubts, Sholay in new 3D format with digitally enhanced sound and picture quality is worth every single penny of your expensive ticket.
