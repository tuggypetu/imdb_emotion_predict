5.0,What are you expecting?,"I found this movie quite enjoyable, and certainly not deserving of the 3 point whatever rating it has. I don't know what most of the voters were expecting, it was obviously a family movie, and I appreciated that. There was no graphic violence, just some slapping, nor were there any sex references, nor any inappropriate jokes (the flatulence jokes were a bit overdone). The movie was humorous, nothing gut busting, but it had enough funny parts to keep me smiling or chuckling the whole time. There were no real lulls or low points, just a nice even keel.This movie is middle of the road. I give it a 5 out of 10.",what are you expecting,i found this movie quite enjoyable certainly not deserving 3 point whatever rating it has i dont know what most voters were expecting it was obviously family movie i appreciated that there was no graphic violence just some slapping nor were there any sex references nor any inappropriate jokes flatulence jokes were bit overdone movie was humorous nothing gut busting but it had enough funny parts keep me smiling or chuckling whole time there were no real lulls or low points just nice even keel this movie is middle road i give it 5 out 10,0.5285714285714286,0.16785714285714284,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.41, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.14}"
6.0,does not deserve to be in the bottom 100,"i'm in my early 30s and i thought it was funny. it's certainly not on par with the brilliant comedies made by monty python, but it's much better than 95% of the PG-13 garbage that continues to be released.it was refreshing to see a PG comedy that wasn't centered around children. i really liked the gammy num nums disguise, and i wish they had been able to work the Mayor Maynot disguise in the movie along with the painting guy. thankfully they were both on the DVD.i've watched it twice now, and will watch it again. dana talked (on a DVD featurette) about how he originally wanted to make a mission impossible type comedy with the master of disguise being part of the team, so maybe he'll go to back to that for a sequel; although, it seems unlikely since the first seems to be rather unpopular.6/10",does not deserve be bottom 100,im my early 30s i thought it was funny its certainly not par with brilliant comedies made by monty python but its much better than 95 pg 13 garbage that continues be released it was refreshing see pg comedy that wasnt centered around children i really liked gammy num nums disguise i wish they had been able work mayor maynot disguise movie along with painting guy thankfully they were both dvd ive watched it twice now will watch it again dana talked dvd featurette about how he originally wanted make mission impossible type comedy with master disguise being part team so maybe hell go back that sequel although it seems unlikely since first seems be rather unpopular 6 10,0.6445970695970696,0.2077838827838828,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,a comedy totally devoid of laughs,"`The Master of Disguise' raises  and indeed answers  the question of whether or not it is possible for a movie that bills itself as a `comedy' to run from beginning to end without offering a single funny moment. (The answer, by the way, is, yes, it can be done). Thus, while his `Wayne's World' partner, Mike Myers, is out there making both a fortune and an indelible impression on pop culture with his `Austin Powers' franchise, poor Dana Carvey is reduced to appearing in disastrous vehicles like this one. Now don't get me wrong. I love Carvey's work on `Saturday Night Live,' especially his impersonations of many of the major political figures of our time. However, Carvey's manic, over-the-top style is, apparently, a whole lot easier to take in small doses. Watching him mug, cavort and pratfall his way through a laughless script for the better part of an hour and a half ultimately becomes as wearying as it is embarrassing to watch.Stealing much of its concept from `The Mask,' `The Master of Disguise' involves Carvey in some nonsense about a family of crime fighters who are able to magically don all sorts of disguises at a moment's notice. This allows the filmmakers to enlist the aid of a number of real life celebrities who end up making cameo appearances, in the misguided belief, most likely, that this was going to be a fun, entertaining movie comedy. Boy, were they misled. Actually, I have rarely seen a film in which the jokes, `bits' and setups fall as consistently flat as they do here. To get a general notion of the level of humor in this film, please note that the running gag involves one character's tendency towards uncontrollable flatulence. It isn't funny the first time it happens and, believe me, it is even less funny the fourth, fifth (or is it sixth?) time around.In addition to the celebrity walk-ons (Bo Derek, Jesse Ventura, Paula Abdul, among others), Harold Gould, James Brolin, Jennifer Espinoto, Brent Spiner and Edie McClurg are all good sports who deserve better material than what they have been handed here. So is Carvey when you come right down to it. But then Carvey wrote the screenplay, so he HAS to be a good sport about it. After all, he handed HIMSELF this material. I hope the other actors trapped in this mess at least got paid well for their endeavors.The only good news is that, in the closing credits, we get to see many of the scenes, lines and characters that were, apparently, filmed, then dropped from the final product. One can only imagine how much worse the film would have been had they all been allowed to stay in.",comedy totally devoid laughs,master disguise raises indeed answers question whether or not it is possible movie that bills itself as comedy run beginning end without offering single funny moment answer by way is yes it can be done thus while his waynes world partner mike myers is out there making both fortune indelible impression pop culture with his austin powers franchise poor dana carvey is reduced appearing disastrous vehicles like this one now dont get me wrong i love carveys work saturday night live especially his impersonations many major political figures our time however carveys manic over top style is apparently whole lot easier take small doses watching him mug cavort pratfall his way through laughless script better part hour half ultimately becomes as wearying as it is embarrassing watch stealing much its concept mask master disguise involves carvey some nonsense about family crime fighters who are able magically don all sorts disguises at moments notice this allows filmmakers enlist aid number real life celebrities who end up making cameo appearances misguided belief most likely that this was going be fun entertaining movie comedy boy were they misled actually i have rarely seen film which jokes bits setups fall as consistently flat as they do here get general notion level humor this film please note that running gag involves one characters tendency towards uncontrollable flatulence it isnt funny first time it happens believe me it is even less funny fourth fifth or is it sixth time around addition celebrity walk ons bo derek jesse ventura paula abdul among others harold gould james brolin jennifer espinoto brent spiner edie mcclurg are all good sports who deserve better material than what they have been handed here so is carvey when you come right down it but then carvey wrote screenplay so he has be good sport about it after all he handed himself this material i hope other actors trapped this mess at least got paid well their endeavors only good news is that closing credits we get see many scenes lines characters that were apparently filmed then dropped final product one can only imagine how much worse film would have been had they all been allowed stay,0.5376068376068376,0.11825500888000888,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.38}"

Kids, you will neither find anything amusing in the movie, as the actors are not funny enough to entice any one of any age.

,Master Of Disguise...more than meets the eye.,"Sheer genius cannot even begin to properly address this cinematic achievement, to call it any less is an insult. Dana Carvey, on the surface, plays a bumbling Italian waiter who inherits the power of disguise; however, if you dig a bit deeper & peel away the layers, you'll find a motion picture which is a scathing, yet biting social political statement on society as a whole. One cannot begin to hopefully comprehend or decipher all the psychological & stereotypical boundaries this film breaks. It is a surprise to find this film in mainstream theaters as a film on this level & caliber would normally only be found in the finest arthouse theaters. If you plan on seeing Master of Disguise, I suggest keeping your afternoon free, as after viewing, no after witnessing it, you'll need the rest of the afternoon to invest in deciphering the dense narrative. Admittingly some of the jokes were over my head, but all truly great comedies take a bit of effort for comprehension.

2.0,"Its reputation doesn't lie, this truly is one poorly crafted and unfunny effort!","I remember seeing a trailer for this movie several times in 2002, back around the time it came into theatres, and could remember the ""Turtle, turtle, turtle!"" clip more than anything else I saw in that trailer. So, I knew about the film when it was current, but also heard that it was getting really bad reviews. Since then, I have become more familiar with the work of Dana Carvey, who co-wrote and starred in this flick. I have now seen several of his ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, and also the two ""Wayne's World"" movies, for which he and Mike Myers brought their headbanging alter egos from SNL to film, so I know that Carvey can be funny. Nearly nine years after ""The Master of Disguise"" was unleashed upon the world and disgusted many people, I've finally seen it, and am now not surprised that I can't contradict the majority's opinion.Pistachio Disguisey is a young Italian man who is totally unaware of the fact that he comes from a long line of secret agents who have all been very skilled in disguising themselves for missions. His father, Fabbrizio, decided it was best not to tell his son about the family's legacy. So, instead of being one of these ""Masters of Disguise,"" like his father once was but not anymore, Pistachio works as a waiter in his father's Italian restaurant in the United States, where his mother also works. One night, Pistachio's parents are kidnapped by Devlin Bowman, a criminal whom Fabbrizio brought to justice during one of his missions as a Master of Disguise, but this criminal has just gotten out of prison! After this kidnapping, the youngest Disguisey's grandfather comes to him and tells him about the family's legacy, and then trains him to use his Disguisey powers, so he can take on Bowman himself and rescue his parents. Meanwhile, the kidnapper is now forcing Fabbrizio the help him with his criminal activities! I've seen too many unfunny comedies lately, and sadly, this one is no exception. Like probably most people who have seen this universally panned 2002 comedy adventure film, I didn't laugh at all. Two or three gags did force the corners of my mouth up, with one or maybe two of the slaps for example, but even those aren't usually funny, and perhaps get a bit tiresome. The turtle costume clip I saw in the trailer in 2002 may not have looked so bad, but this part of the movie is a great example of the lameness here, with Dana Carvey as Pistachio trying to be funny, but basically just being ridiculously goofy, and the same can probably be said about most of the other disguises. Many of the jokes in the film involve the lead character's fondness of large female buttocks, and this is never funny. There's also a running gag showing that whenever Devlin Bowman laughs, he is soon silenced by his own flatulence, and this doesn't tend to be funny, even if it ALMOST made me smile later on for some reason. Not only is the humour in his film consistently lame, the plot is also boring and clumsily written.After this film was made, Dana Carvey went on hiatus to focus on his family life, and I can't blame him for that, but this sure was a poor piece for him to leave us with. Since then, he has returned to show business, making several TV appearances and showing that he still has his talent, which is something he didn't show when he made ""The Master of Disguise"". It appears he is also returning to the silver screen in the upcoming ""Jack and Jill"", coming from Happy Madison Productions, the company that was also involved in the production of this 2002 disaster, but no matter how good or bad this movie turns out to be, it looks like Carvey will only have a very small part in it. Well, even if he never plays any major film role again, he has proved to be a talented comedian through his decades in the business, despite this terrible film. I'm not sure if my 2/10 rating is too low, even if most people wouldn't think it is, but now that I've seen it after nearly a decade, I can understand why it was so poorly received.",its reputation doesnt lie this truly is one poorly crafted unfunny effort,i remember seeing trailer this movie several times 2002 back around time it came into theatres could remember turtle turtle turtle clip more than anything else i saw that trailer so i knew about film when it was current but also heard that it was getting really bad reviews since then i have become more familiar with work dana carvey who co wrote starred this flick i have now seen several his saturday night live sketches also two waynes world movies which he mike myers brought their headbanging alter egos snl film so i know that carvey can be funny nearly nine years after master disguise was unleashed upon world disgusted many people ive finally seen it am now not surprised that i cant contradict majoritys opinion pistachio disguisey is young italian man who is totally unaware fact that he comes long line secret agents who have all been very skilled disguising themselves missions his father fabbrizio decided it was best not tell his son about familys legacy so instead being one these masters disguise like his father once was but not anymore pistachio works as waiter his fathers italian restaurant united states where his mother also works one night pistachios parents are kidnapped by devlin bowman criminal whom fabbrizio brought justice during one his missions as master disguise but this criminal has just gotten out prison after this kidnapping youngest disguiseys grandfather comes him tells him about familys legacy then trains him use his disguisey powers so he can take bowman himself rescue his parents meanwhile kidnapper is now forcing fabbrizio help him with his criminal activities ive seen too many unfunny comedies lately sadly this one is no exception like probably most people who have seen this universally panned 2002 comedy adventure film i didnt laugh at all two or three gags did force corners my mouth up with one or maybe two slaps example but even those arent usually funny perhaps get bit tiresome turtle costume clip i saw trailer 2002 may not have looked so bad but this part movie is great example lameness here with dana carvey as pistachio trying be funny but basically just being ridiculously goofy same can probably be said about most other disguises many jokes film involve lead characters fondness large female buttocks this is never funny theres also running gag showing that whenever devlin bowman laughs he is soon silenced by his own flatulence this doesnt tend be funny even if it almost made me smile later some reason not only is humour his film consistently lame plot is also boring clumsily written after this film was made dana carvey went hiatus focus his family life i cant blame him that but this sure was poor piece him leave us with since then he has returned show business making several tv appearances showing that he still has his talent which is something he didnt show when he made master disguise it appears he is also returning silver screen upcoming jack jill coming happy madison productions company that was also involved production this 2002 disaster but no matter how good or bad this movie turns out be it looks like carvey will only have very small part it well even if he never plays any major film role again he has proved be talented comedian through his decades business despite this terrible film im not sure if my 2 10 rating is too low even if most people wouldnt think it is but now that ive seen it after nearly decade i can understand why it was so poorly received,0.5694639981596503,0.03352390363259929,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,Master of not being funny.,"I'll say this about Dana Carvey, he can be a funny guy. He had some talent on Saturday Night Live before it became ""SNL"" and became the breakout star of the season. But like the curse of SNL goes, that doesn't mean he was able to make a movie.There are actually very few SNL alumns that have made it in Hollywood. I'd say Bill Murray would be the reigning king and, while I don't get their appeal, Will Farrell and Adam Sandler have managed to make a good career of it as well. Sure others have made it with varying degrees of success but it's usually a story that these people just don't go on to bigger and better things afterwards and nobody seems to show this more than Dana Carvey.He had some good skills at making voices, mimicry and characters and so they figured why not build a movie around this and have him take on different roles and characters. But the problem is they forgot along the way that it's not a character that makes a line funny, it's the actor playing the character that does this. And honestly, this failed because the characters he played were just one dimensional and had no point in existing other than to be in this movie to show Dana's range.In the end, it's a highly forgettable and very disappointing movie from somebody that could have done a lot better for himself.",master not being funny,ill say this about dana carvey he can be funny guy he had some talent saturday night live before it became snl became breakout star season but like curse snl goes that doesnt mean he was able make movie there are actually very few snl alumns that have made it hollywood id say bill murray would be reigning king while i dont get their appeal will farrell adam sandler have managed make good career it as well sure others have made it with varying degrees success but its usually story that these people just dont go bigger better things afterwards nobody seems show this more than dana carvey he had some good skills at making voices mimicry characters so they figured why not build movie around this have him take different roles characters but problem is they forgot along way that its not character that makes line funny its actor playing character that does this honestly this failed because characters he played were just one dimensional had no point existing other than be this movie show danas range end its highly forgettable very disappointing movie somebody that could have done lot better himself,0.6028864734299517,0.10690711462450593,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.41}"

I was 10 or 11 at the time. We watched the latter film first and didn't mind it. Then we watched this. As a child, I didn't like this movie. And I haven't seen it since. It's a terrible movie and it wastes the talent that Dana Carvey does have. Not funny in the slightest. And I was excited to see this as a kid too.

,"A bit kiddish, but it has it's moments. Hats off to Dana for a great family movie","Dana Carvey was very smart for bringing a movie to the screen like this. Barely ever to SNL veterans do family comedys, but Dana Carvey(SNL, Wayne's World) did. This movie is a bit kiddish in the jokes at times, but it has it's moments. The audience in the screening of this film laughed at a lot of hidden adult jokes, like the Geoge Bush stuff(in SNL, Dana Carvey used to impersonate the elder Bush, in MASTER OF DISGUISE, at one point he does the new Bush). Anyway, even though I doubt very much it'll do first at the box office(my theory will be goldmember, or a very close SIGNS at 1st, and Master of disguise 3rd), I'm still glad Dana could make a great kids movie, without a lot of unneccesary things in films that give it a PG-13 rating. There are a lot of films that would be great family movies, that are loaded with PG-13 material. I'm not saying all the movies should be family, I just hate when there is a really stupid kid movie, I mean take Stuart Little 1 or 2, which could be rated g, and right at the end of the first they throw in language, to give it a pg rating. They didn't even have to do that. Same with pg movies jipped to pg-13. Sometimes you don't need to do it, moviemakers, when it clearly is a kids movie, and filmmakers try to throw in things to make it pg13, when it's kiddish, and no teen's going to go see it anyway, so they're stuck with 6 year olds, going to see pg-13s! I hope that more people realize, that some movies are adult, and some are family. Don't throw things in family movies that don't need to be there, just in hopes of getting older audiences. They're still not going to go see it. But take my advice. See master of disguise, either in theaters, or on video. I saw the screening a few weeks ago, and I did laugh. Not a whole lot, but I laughed.2.5/5 STARS",bit kiddish but it has its moments hats off dana great family movie,dana carvey was very smart bringing movie screen like this barely ever snl veterans do family comedys but dana carvey snl waynes world did this movie is bit kiddish jokes at times but it has its moments audience screening this film laughed at lot hidden adult jokes like geoge bush stuff snl dana carvey used impersonate elder bush master disguise at one point he does new bush anyway even though i doubt very much itll do first at box office my theory will be goldmember or very close signs at 1st master disguise 3rd im still glad dana could make great kids movie without lot unneccesary things films that give it pg 13 rating there are lot films that would be great family movies that are loaded with pg 13 material im not saying all movies should be family i just hate when there is really stupid kid movie i mean take stuart little 1 or 2 which could be rated g right at end first they throw language give it pg rating they didnt even have do that same with pg movies jipped pg 13 sometimes you dont need do it moviemakers when it clearly is kids movie filmmakers try throw things make it pg13 when its kiddish no teens going go see it anyway so theyre stuck with 6 year olds going see pg 13s i hope that more people realize that some movies are adult some are family dont throw things family movies that dont need be there just hopes getting older audiences theyre still not going go see it but take my advice see master disguise either theaters or video i saw screening few weeks ago i did laugh not whole lot but i laughed 2 5 5 stars,0.44017726526347223,0.16243618450515004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.28}"
3.0,I Thought It Would Have Been Good to See Dana Carvey Back But..,"Oh my! ""Opportunity Knocks"" and ""Clean Slate"" were not exactly film classics, although compared to this movie, they may as well have been works of Shakespeare. Arguably the dumbest movie I have ever paid money to see in theatre (thanks to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" being sold out), this does not fit in the dumb but funny category of most of Adam Sandler's or Chris Farley's films, but in the jaw-droppingly dumb category. My wife and I often gazed at each other in amazement during this movie, unable to exactly process that something this truly silly and dumb was made (much less by Dana Carvey and Adam Sandler) and even stranger that others in the crowded theatre were laughing their heads off! We were excited to see Dana Carvey back in the movies, but there was good reason why this movie was not screened for review ahead of time.To continue, I should say we had misgivings about seeing the film after the TV trailers that kept showing the ""turtle"" sequence, but decided that part was just silly fun and there's no way the rest of the movie could be so unclever and dumb. To our amazement, that was easily the most intelligent and serious part of the film! Think carefully before wasting your time with this one.. I score it a generous 3/10.",i thought it would have been good see dana carvey back but,oh my opportunity knocks clean slate were not exactly film classics although compared this movie they may as well have been works shakespeare arguably dumbest movie i have ever paid money see theatre thanks my big fat greek wedding being sold out this does not fit dumb but funny category most adam sandlers or chris farleys films but jaw droppingly dumb category my wife i often gazed at each other amazement during this movie unable exactly process that something this truly silly dumb was made much less by dana carvey adam sandler even stranger that others crowded theatre were laughing their heads off we were excited see dana carvey back movies but there was good reason why this movie was not screened review ahead time continue i should say we had misgivings about seeing film after tv trailers that kept showing turtle sequence but decided that part was just silly fun theres no way rest movie could be so unclever dumb our amazement that was easily most intelligent serious part film think carefully before wasting your time with this one i score it generous 3 10,0.47529761904761897,0.0318452380952381,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.32}"
