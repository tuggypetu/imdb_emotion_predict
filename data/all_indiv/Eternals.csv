3.0,Dire.,"I've read several critical reviews applauding this film, however having sat through it twice I have to point out that this is a very poor film.Almost two and a half hours long, and every single minute of this film was an effort. How on Earth did they think this would appeal?It's a lifeless watch, it rambles along at a torturous pace, and sadly half the cast seem totally disinterested, giving very wooden performances.Special effects vary, some look good, some look very poor, when you look at the budget this film had, it should have looked flawless, it doesn't.I love Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but neither of them look totally at home here, I only hope this turkey of a movie doesn't halt either career.I don't think a second will follow somehow.Awful sadly, I did give it a second watch to be sure, but there you are, it's a shocker, 3/10.",dire,ive read several critical reviews applauding this film however having sat through it twice i have point out that this is very poor film almost two half hours long every single minute this film was effort how earth did they think this would appeal its lifeless watch it rambles along at torturous pace sadly half cast seem totally disinterested giving very wooden performances special effects vary some look good some look very poor when you look at budget this film had it should have looked flawless it doesnt i love gemma chan richard madden but neither them look totally at home here i only hope this turkey movie doesnt halt either career i dont think second will follow somehow awful sadly i did give it second watch be sure but there you are its shocker 3 10,0.5460922146636432,0.0029705215419501157,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.44, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.36}"
2.0,Definitely my #1 Worst Movie of the Year!,"Ok but how are they speaking english since they are before the time when english language was spoken? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The amount of plot holes and wasted potential was really annoying and Sersei had 0 personality. The visuals were amazing but it doesn't make up for the lack of logic put into the movie. The powers were so inconsistent and the prime eternal was just wasted after not even putting up a fight. The deviants were wasted as well and the celestials not telling the eternals why they're on the planet made no sense. Just so many reasons to dislike the execution of the movie. This was a lame movie, there is always a useless hero in every show and Thena was this movies useless hero... How tf you let your man die right in front of you. Thanos IS a Deviant-Eternal. So where's the logic. This movie was completely overrated i'm sorry. This film was the worst mcu film. So boring and the plot was all over the place.",definitely my worst movie year,ok but how are they speaking english since they are before time when english language was spoken i was extremely disappointed with this movie amount plot holes wasted potential was really annoying sersei had 0 personality visuals were amazing but it doesnt make up lack logic put into movie powers were so inconsistent prime eternal was just wasted after not even putting up fight deviants were wasted as well celestials not telling eternals why theyre planet made no sense just so many reasons dislike execution movie this was lame movie there is always useless hero every show thena was this movies useless hero how tf you let your man die right front you thanos is deviant eternal so wheres logic this movie was completely overrated im sorry this film was worst mcu film so boring plot was all over place,0.5317857142857143,-0.25821428571428573,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.11, 'Sad': 0.59, 'Fear': 0.26}"
2.0,Most boring supers ever,"I can understand Marvel wanting to expand its universe; all you have to do is look at the dollars to understand it. But, the thing about superheroes, they have to be super beyond their powers. I didn't know anything about these characters and frankly after watching this movie I don't want to know anymore. I thought Justice league and Batman versus Superman were bad. But nothing has been as boring as this movie. It's cheesy and preachy with no interesting characters except Sprite and the Deviant.

3.0,Fairly shallow Marvel experience...,"Another year, another Marvel Studios superhero movie, right? Well, so it would seem. I had only vaguely heard about ""Eternals"" prior to sitting down to watch it. But then again, superhero movies isn't exactly my primary go-to-movie choice. But yeah, I do watch them if given the chance, as Marvel Studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if for nothing else then for the amazing CGI.And that was the case with the 2021 movie ""Eternals"" from writers Chloé Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo. This movie was all flash and bang and no proper contents. It was all essentially just pointless eye-candy.For me, then we are talking about a swing and a miss for Marvel Studios with the 2021 superhero movie ""Eternals"". When the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of 'what did I just waste two and a half hours on watching?'. And I was also left with a sense of none of the characters portrayed in the story had any significance or backstory. You might as well replace them with mannequins and still end up with the same movie result.You would assume that with a cast ensemble that included the likes of Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and Lauren Ridloff among others, that you would be in for a stellar movie experience. But nay, director Chloé Zhao didn't rise to the occasion to deliver a wholesome and entertaining superhero movie. Nope, this was a lukewarm movie at best.The total absence of properly written characters and character development throughout the two and a half hours of runtime was just atrocious to witness. And it totally turned the movie into a shallow experience. Yet, I managed to sit through it, but believe you me, this is not a movie that I will ever be returning to watch a second time. There were so many characters to keep track off, yet none of them had any properly written backstory, character traits, personalities or anything, so they just sort of blended into one singular faceless mass. And hence, I didn't care one bit about any of the hero characters, because they were about as interesting as mannequins.""Eternals"" was pure and simply just eye-candy in term of entertainment value. The storyline would have been more interesting if the story had interesting characters, subplots, etc., but there was no such thing going on here.Sure, I am by no account a fan of the superhero genre, but watch the movie regardless, but ""Eternals"" was definitely among the top contenders for being among the most pointless and boring of superhero movies.My rating of ""Eternals"" lands on a three out of ten stars.",fairly shallow marvel experience,another year another marvel studios superhero movie right well so it would seem i had only vaguely heard about eternals prior sitting down watch it but then again superhero movies isnt exactly my primary go movie choice but yeah i do watch them if given chance as marvel studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if nothing else then amazing cgi that was case with 2021 movie eternals writers chlo zhao patrick burleigh ryan firpo kaz firpo this movie was all flash bang no proper contents it was all essentially just pointless eye candy me then we are talking about swing miss marvel studios with 2021 superhero movie eternals when movie ended i was left with overwhelming sensation what did i just waste two half hours watching i was also left with sense none characters portrayed story had any significance or backstory you might as well replace them with mannequins still end up with same movie result you would assume that with cast ensemble that included likes gemma chan angelina jolie salma hayek kit harington lauren ridloff among others that you would be stellar movie experience but nay director chlo zhao didnt rise occasion deliver wholesome entertaining superhero movie nope this was lukewarm movie at best total absence properly written characters character development throughout two half hours runtime was just atrocious witness it totally turned movie into shallow experience yet i managed sit through it but believe you me this is not movie that i will ever be returning watch second time there were so many characters keep track off yet none them had any properly written backstory character traits personalities or anything so they just sort blended into one singular faceless mass hence i didnt care one bit about any hero characters because they were about as interesting as mannequins eternals was pure simply just eye candy term entertainment value storyline would have been more interesting if story had interesting characters subplots etc but there was no such thing going here sure i am by no account fan superhero genre but watch movie regardless but eternals was definitely among top contenders being among most pointless boring superhero movies my rating eternals lands three out ten stars,0.42345583160800554,0.08656400966183575,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.05, 'Fear': 0.46}"
4.0,Watching this movie felt like an eternity,"Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer.",watching this movie felt like eternity,shang chi gave me hope phase 4 marvel eternals dashed those hopes this is probably my least favorite marvel movie this film is too long crammed full overly complicated plot points yet its also completely predictable it seems filmmakers were too busy trying check off boxes rather than create good story its also downer people watch mcu movies have fun not have existential crises perhaps eternals should have stood sidelines little longer,0.545,0.07125,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"
4.0,Watching people who mostly can't die (eternals) fight each other can be boring,"This review has been declined 3 times now. I don't know why, I think it's cos of the real name of Gilgamesh coinciding with an english word.The whole film was pretty flat, John Snow turned up and said some funny lines, and Gemma Chan was lovely to look at, but there sure was a lot of cheese in this vegan meal of a film. Some terrible 'inspirational' life messages delivered direct to camera that made you cringe with their rhetoric.It played like it was constructed from a ""making big budget films for dummies"" book, and they left it at pretty much the bullet points list on the inside cover.Shoehorn in a Diversity cast that differed greatly from the source material. I do like to see diversity on screen but sometimes it appears over zealous, like this film and comes across as forced and token and works against the world of the film. The Eternals are not from earth at all so no need to tick all the diversity check boxes. Quite the opposite, they should appear with no cultural links at all. They also shoe horned in a sign language eternal, which just made no sense in the world of the Eternals, Why would the massively powerful universe creators create an eternal who couldn't hear or speak and needed to use their hands to communicate? The original comics had Makkari as a Male who has a relationship with Sersi, in fact many of the original Eternals are male. I'm all for positive representations on a diverse society, but this casting choice just came across as weird as far as the film's story was concerned.Slot in an ex boy band debut as an actor - Check!My eyes rolled back into my head when that happened. Big budget movie making by the numbers.I don't know quite where the problem was. Chloé Zhao's direction by committee choices? It wasn't all bad, there was some decent acting, particularly Barry Keoghan who's character seemed complex, but,... even so it was roped in and never went anywhere. Gilgamesh also was good, until he was dispatched easily.Then they started fighting each other, and they're Eternals and can't die, except when it's convenient to move the plot along. It got boring really quickly.",watching people who mostly cant die eternals fight each other can be boring,this review has been declined 3 times now i dont know why i think its cos real name gilgamesh coinciding with english word whole film was pretty flat john snow turned up said some funny lines gemma chan was lovely look at but there sure was lot cheese this vegan meal film some terrible inspirational life messages delivered direct camera that made you cringe with their rhetoric it played like it was constructed making big budget films dummies book they left it at pretty much bullet points list inside cover shoehorn diversity cast that differed greatly source material i do like see diversity screen but sometimes it appears over zealous like this film comes across as forced token works against world film eternals are not earth at all so no need tick all diversity check boxes quite opposite they should appear with no cultural links at all they also shoe horned sign language eternal which just made no sense world eternals why would massively powerful universe creators create eternal who couldnt hear or speak needed use their hands communicate original comics had makkari as male who has relationship with sersi fact many original eternals are male im all positive representations diverse society but this casting choice just came across as weird as far as films story was concerned slot ex boy band debut as actor check my eyes rolled back into my head when that happened big budget movie making by numbers i dont know quite where problem was chlo zhaos direction by committee choices it wasnt all bad there was some decent acting particularly barry keoghan whos character seemed complex but even so it was roped never went anywhere gilgamesh also was good until he was dispatched easily then they started fighting each other theyre eternals cant die except when its convenient move plot along it got boring really quickly,0.5188219403335682,0.06516913319238901,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.39}"
2.0,Worst MCU film ever,"Following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants.This film is by far the worst MCU film I have watch. It's massive insuylt to the comics from the Jack Kirby days. Gender swapping some of the eternals, bad story telling which makes absolutely no sense, unlikeable characters, little to no action and ridicules changes to the MCU just sum up how bad this film.

5.0,hard to connect,"The Eternals are immortals created to eliminate the destructive Deviants. 7000 years ago, ten Eternals were sent to Earth. They were able to eliminate the last Deviant 500 years ago and have been waiting to go home ever since.This is a reach for the MCU franchise. I like the audacity but there are issues with the execution. I do like the style and the visual but I find the characters hard to connect with. They are god-like creatures trying to pass as humans. There is something compelling in that but the characters never fully find their human level. There is barrier to these characters that the film is unable to breach. In addition, Angelina Jolie is too distracting in this role. I like Gemma Chan but maybe she should play Thena. Sersi needs an ingenue with star power. In the end, this is a tougher premise to execute than most and the film struggles to give it a human scale.",hard connect,eternals are immortals created eliminate destructive deviants 7000 years ago ten eternals were sent earth they were able eliminate last deviant 500 years ago have been waiting go home ever since this is reach mcu franchise i like audacity but there are issues with execution i do like style visual but i find characters hard connect with they are god like creatures trying pass as humans there is something compelling that but characters never fully find their human level there is barrier these characters that film is unable breach addition angelina jolie is too distracting this role i like gemma chan but maybe she should play thena sersi needs ingenue with star power end this is tougher premise execute than most film struggles give it human scale,0.34791666666666665,-0.03194444444444444,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.16, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.37}"
2.0,It just feels like an unnecessary movie,"The whole plot was terrible . They focused all the attention for almost 2 hours on the deviance and all of a sudden it turns out they're not the bad guys after all let's focus 30 minutes of the rest of the movie on someone else.. Marvel failed a great cast with a terrible script. Marvel should separate Eternals film into 2 Parts to have more progressive storyline and deep dive on characterization and the build up of motivation to save the Earth with balanced action sequences and dramas in between... Eternals Book 1 and Eternals Book 2. Just like what Warner did on Dune film.. or Avengers 3 and 4. Worst movie I've seen in years!!!! Worst MCU movie. Hardly any character development, no reason to care about the characters. Outside if him, the comedy was lackluster. Pace was off. Most performances by the actors were good but their stories were not deep enough, hard to do with that many protagonists in one movie. My first thought was why do the people already have british and scottish accent even before they arrive on earth? Like it would make sense if they all spoke similar english when they first arrive on Earth but when they later end up separating and going their own ways they end up developing their british and scottish accent or whatever. Maybe I'm nitpicking it too much but it was literally the first scene in the movie that just broke my immersion immediately.",it just feels like unnecessary movie,whole plot was terrible they focused all attention almost 2 hours deviance all sudden it turns out theyre not bad guys after all lets focus 30 minutes rest movie someone else marvel failed great cast with terrible script marvel should separate eternals film into 2 parts have more progressive storyline deep dive characterization build up motivation save earth with balanced action sequences dramas between eternals book 1 eternals book 2 just like what warner did dune film or avengers 3 4 worst movie ive seen years worst mcu movie hardly any character development no reason care about characters outside if him comedy was lackluster pace was off most performances by actors were good but their stories were not deep enough hard do with that many protagonists one movie my first thought was why do people already have british scottish accent even before they arrive earth like it would make sense if they all spoke similar english when they first arrive earth but when they later end up separating going their own ways they end up developing their british scottish accent or whatever maybe im nitpicking it too much but it was literally first scene movie that just broke my immersion immediately,0.47580645161290325,-0.009139784946236563,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.41}"
5.0,Eternal was the Runtime,"I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.""Eternals"" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could've been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don't know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute.",eternal was runtime,im not going give long winded review though movie was long eternal was runtime there were parts that were good parts that werent one biggest issues is that movie this nature presents more questions than it answers very existence eternal beings existing planet earth sent there by their creator order protect human life deviants begs lot questions more they strayed their prime directive more questions they presented eternals were human every aspect with exception their powers their lifespan fact that such humanlike very fallible beings as not entirely obedient were sent protect humans is just start questions eternals was unnecessarily long there were plenty scenes that couldve been left cutting room floor marvel bit off lot with this metaphysical beginning creation movie it was very emotional slow at many points even comic relief failed garner laughs it intended but there was applause theater after it was over honestly i dont know if that was based upon how good movie was or simply mcu diehards paying their obligatory tribute,0.4696583850931678,0.1260869565217391,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.5}"

,Neither Intrigues Nor Entertains,"The 26th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe marks the arrival of a new brand of superheroes into their ever-growing family and further expands the horizons of its shared universe with its grand scope. However, being one of the lesser-known properties the way Guardians was back in 2014, Eternals needed to create an intrigue & curiosity to make us care & invest in its mythic world but the film as a whole simply falls flat at it.Co-written & directed by Chloé Zhao (The Rider & Nomadland), her latest effort opts for a slightly different path that at times avoids or escapes the familiar trappings of a standard Marvel fare but then its attempts to forge its own identity is executed with such blandness that there is no life to it. The film is devoid of the fun & fascinating qualities of its studio's finest works and neither its storytelling nor its ensemble compel us enough to give a damn.It is an ambitious undertaking no doubt that intends to explore a few interesting ideas but Zhao goes for it without working out the fundamentals first. She aims for the intimacy with surface-level digging into these superpowered beings but with there being no incentive for us to even bother, the emotions & warmth don't shine through. Add to that, the story is needlessly overlong, tediously paced, and is filled with characters without camaraderie with one another.Overall, Eternals is a dull, lifeless & forgettable addition to Marvel Studios canon and also happens to be one of their rarest gambles that doesn't pay off the desired dividends. While the diverse ensemble is a welcome move from the inclusivity standpoint, the actors are more or less wasted in their roles and aren't given anything interesting to leave their imprint upon. It remains to be seen how this chapter plays out in Marvel's Phase 4 plan but as a standalone entry, Eternals is mediocre at best.",neither intrigues nor entertains,26th instalment marvel cinematic universe marks arrival new brand superheroes into their ever growing family further expands horizons its shared universe with its grand scope however being one lesser known properties way guardians was back 2014 eternals needed create intrigue curiosity make us care invest its mythic world but film as whole simply falls flat at it co written directed by chlo zhao rider nomadland her latest effort opts slightly different path that at times avoids or escapes familiar trappings standard marvel fare but then its attempts forge its own identity is executed with such blandness that there is no life it film is devoid fun fascinating qualities its studios finest works neither its storytelling nor its ensemble compel us enough give damn it is ambitious undertaking no doubt that intends explore few interesting ideas but zhao goes it without working out fundamentals first she aims intimacy with surface level digging into these superpowered beings but with there being no incentive us even bother emotions warmth dont shine through add that story is needlessly overlong tediously paced is filled with characters without camaraderie with one another overall eternals is dull lifeless forgettable addition marvel studios canon also happens be one their rarest gambles that doesnt pay off desired dividends while diverse ensemble is welcome move inclusivity standpoint actors are more or less wasted their roles arent given anything interesting leave their imprint upon it remains be seen how this chapter plays out marvels phase 4 plan but as standalone entry eternals is mediocre at best,0.4899080086580087,0.12577861952861952,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.39}"

So Celestials need to seed intelligent life to birth their kind but stood by somehow as Thanos wiped out half of life, then came back to completely wipe out the other half and all of existence? I really want to like this movie but it just didn't really work for me. Really feel like this needed to be a miniseries or spread out across multiple movies. Just too much stuff crammed into a 2 hour period. Didn't give me enough time to care about the characters/story that much, and the wonky pacing and acting didn't help with that either.

2.0,Won't watch again,"This movie felt like 3 movies supercut into one. Pacing was all over the place. Seems a stretch for me to call most of these characters ""super-heroes,"" most seemed remarkably pathetic in their abilities, some of these ""Eternals"" were so easily killed, yet some inexplicably were tanks. Humor was very weak; the best lines were from the trailer and most of those were cringey. Kit Harrington was wasted. Angelina Jolie was wasted.

1.0,Horrible,"Trying to be ""deep"", the director uses some long shots (or longer than usual in the MCU) here and there, less frenetic editing here and there, and less Marvel humor (there is enough though), in a thing that turned to be a really, really bad experiment. Valient effort though?In the end, none of that matters that much because the biggest problems with the movie are the simple things: way too many characters, all flat and not particularly interesting (maybe because there is not time to develop them); the interpretations from the important ones, the leads, robotic and soulless; the story told in unnecessary back and forth, maybe as an attempt to make it seem more complex than it was, and not letting the movie to get into any rhythm; and finally, contrary to what I read a lot, the special effects and the desings of the powers and suits and the actions scenes, all just bad, simple or with awful CGI (or a combination of those).Other than that, it was great(?)",horrible,trying be deep director uses some long shots or longer than usual mcu here there less frenetic editing here there less marvel humor there is enough though thing that turned be really really bad experiment valient effort though end none that matters that much because biggest problems with movie are simple things way too many characters all flat not particularly interesting maybe because there is not time develop them interpretations important ones leads robotic soulless story told unnecessary back forth maybe as attempt make it seem more complex than it was not letting movie get into any rhythm finally contrary what i read lot special effects desings powers suits actions scenes all just bad simple or with awful cgi or combination those other than that it was great,0.4904761904761905,-0.09523809523809525,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.38}"

5.0,i'm so sad,"I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.I see this as the MCU homage to Watchmen. It feels very ""adult"" in so many ways. But in others, it's childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless side plots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn't feel natural, something always feels a bit off.There's a lot i enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn't. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi. The deep philosophical themes were interesting but poorly executed.Sigh. I'll probably watch it again to see if it grows on me. But this might be the worst MCU movie.Edit: I watched it again, in IMAX of course. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. All of my initial flaws are still there. But I focused on all of the good, and tried to ignore the bad. It made for a much better experience, especially after moving past the initial disappointment of how truly amazing it could have been.I think the reason I found the protagonist so underwhelming is because she doesn't drive the plot. Her character is always reactive. Things happen to her. She's generally likeable, but a weak character. And one thing that was impossible to ignore even when I tried, Salma Hayek was a terrible choice.My favorite character is Druig, with a great performance by Barry Keoghan. I really like most of the other characters and wish I could have seen more from them. Kumail Nanjiani is awesome, except when they give him random ""insert joke here"" lines. I'm curious to see more from most of the characters.This movie is still very flawed. And I absolutely hated how certain character conflicts were resolved after major decisions were made. But if you can move past the bad, you can enjoy the action, visuals, and ambition. Rating updated from 4 stars to 5 stars.

4.0,Definitely the MCU's weakest movie,"Eternals had the potential to be a real standout film from the crowd, but it missed out on breaking ranks from its franchise's long-held cliches like 'action scene then funny one-liner' moments that don't feel like character moments anymore, but 'creative mandates' imposed by the studio.It's a BIG movie, so big that it's got too many stories for it's single-movie outline and all these brand-spanking-new characters who desperately needed more character development outside Eternal's 2 and ½ hour runtime. This movie is a 'beautifully made mess': and it's bound to be 'retconned' with a throwaway line of dialogue (or with some jokes) in one of the next Avengers movies like Thor 2 was in Ragnarok.Eternals gets 2/5 stars.

It was an eye candy watch for seeing the hot and sexy Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group.

4.0,Hope This Timeline Isn't Eternal,"This was almost a dead-even 5/10 star film, but the more I think about it, the less I like it. I HAAAATED some of the incredibly cheap looking CGI. Sure, SOME of it was good, but our main villains, the devil-alien dogs were laughably fake looking and the 1st post-credit scene had this small ""creature"" who was about on par with Super Nintendo graphics. Also, only some of the humor landed, but most felt forced. I did LOVE all the diversity and acting - each actor really tried their best. The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it. Either you need to reboot everything or make origin stories set in present day only. Finally, I 100% hated the inclusion of a particular reference in regards to comparing the lead male Eternal, Ikaris to another superhero.Overall, it's absolutely not the worst MCU movie, but it fits nowhere in the top half best. Since it's barely, like 1%, connected to the other MCU movies, it could be a skip for sure.",hope this timeline isnt eternal,this was almost dead even 5 10 star film but more i think about it less i like it i haaaated some incredibly cheap looking cgi sure some it was good but our main villains devil alien dogs were laughably fake looking 1st post credit scene had this small creature who was about par with super nintendo graphics also only some humor landed but most felt forced i did love all diversity acting each actor really tried their best plot is okay but it did drag shoot am i tired hearing excuses when mcu introduces new super human characters who were around wars including infinity war did nothing help prevent it either you need reboot everything or make origin stories set present day only finally i 100 hated inclusion particular reference regards comparing lead male eternal ikaris another superhero overall its absolutely not worst mcu movie but it fits nowhere top half best since its barely like 1 connected other mcu movies it could be skip sure,0.47530236576289214,0.1349481658692185,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.41}"
1.0,Pathetic Casting & Poor Storytelling,"For the first 40 minutes I had no clue what, why, who, where and again what? The characters are written really badly and the story was a drag at times. The VFX was as good as any Marvels film but everything else was so bad that it doesn't deserve a watch especially the casting. Every single lead was bad. I can't digest Salma Hayek. She's the same person, talking like the same character for more than 2 decades with different clothes. Pathetic. Kunal nanjijkdjdhg should stop acting. I don't know if he is being realistic or sarcastic when he opens his mouth. I don't know if that little girl is actually little or a girl. There is no back story for the characters. I haven't read the comics, so I have no clue what I saw. Why not the next film have al chinese actors only because that's where marvels is headed to.Ikaris character taunts that he doesn't wear a cape when he is mistook for Superman but by watching this film it's clear that he isn't half as powerful as Superman. Why Kit Harrington? He had nothing to do in the entire film. 3-4 wasteful scenes and he was gone. He was better left at the Night's Watch. They could have introduced him in the sequel which I am not interested in. David Kaye's voice as Areshmi was horrible. I couldn't get the dialogues at all. Why hugely built or powerful characters need to have such thick voices? It's like they are grunting gibberish. As I said, pathetic casting. Anyway, Eternal means forever but these characters die like humans.If they could have written this as a series in mind, they could have explained each character and their back stories making us connect with them more, probably. Post Avengers, marvels looks like they are done and dusted.The problem for me began with my OTT - Disney+. The subtitles are either in Indonesian or Malay. Not in English. I had to switch the audio to two other languages at times to get the dialogue. Sometimes the BG music took over the dialogue and sometimes it's just not clear.
