8.0,Milkha Singh Has Won. So Has The Biographical Film. Everybody Rise! â™¦ 80%,"In less than ten minutes into the film, you get goosebumps all over your body. You get into high-spirits and then the story of The Flying Sikh begins...It talks more about perseverance and how man can excel even in the worst conditions than the actual atheltic history. Milkha Singh, wonderfully portrayed by the talented Farhan Akhtar is one character that induces inspiration. Akhtar now has totally proved himself as a successful actor. His demeanor is appreciable and the film does showcase his hard-work. Supporting cast is very good as well. But, the actresses were sidelined which is very apt for a bio-film.Most of the story is told in flashbacks and there is where the screenplay works. It grabs your attention. The childhood story MAY bore you a little, but every other biopic has to be honest. Much like last year's Paan Singh Tomar, BMB does have lots of surprises in store. The relation of every detail is astronomical and very well adapted. Fresh writing, inventive editing & below-average SFX/CGI makes me wanna give it a humble 8.0/10.The songs & score are energetic which do cause an urge that we run with the athletes on-screen. That is the power of Rakeysh O Mehra and his crew. I was blown away by Akhtar's bod and his expressions. Humor touches the script at times, as well.Overall, an entertaining biography which is well-written and well- executed. Only, the running time of 190 minutes COULD'VE... could've been shortened. Otherwise, everybody rise for this cinema of massive potential.BOTTOM LINE: A very good entertainer with mentoring prowess. It feels good that the team has brought an epitome into reel.

8.0,MY REVIEW: Run Farhan Run!!,"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works for two basic reasons. One it is based on the story of a sports person whose personal life is dramatic enough to keep you engaged apart from its racing track achievements and second it is played by Farhan Akhtar who plays his role as if he is really Milkha Singh himself. Farhan Akhtar excels playing Milkha Singh like Ben Kingsley excelled playing Gandhi. Farhan Akhtar seems to be enjoying every bit of the movie. When he runs, he runs like a tiger. When he dances, he dances like a pure Punjabi. When he loves, he loves with innocence and passion. Farhan Akhtar can easily be given all best actor awards of 2013. All supporting actors give their best. Divya Dutta is excellent, Sonam Kapoor looks fresh, Pawan Malhotra and Parkash Raj's performance are heartwarming. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is first rate and awe inspiring. Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra like an expert captain provides movie its uniqueness, technical perfection, soul and purpose. Like an every fantastic experience, this also comes with its dull moments. Movie takes around extra half an hour before reaching to its finale. Rangrezz song could have been avoided and prolonged sequences of Milkha's achievements could have been shortened. Dilip Tahil playing Pandit Nehru looks like a missed stroke. At the end, you can safely say, you had a great time running with Farhan Akhtar for more than 3 hours. Run to your nearest theater now to watch this powerful biopic.",my review run farhan run,bhaag milkha bhaag works two basic reasons one it is based story sports person whose personal life is dramatic enough keep you engaged apart its racing track achievements second it is played by farhan akhtar who plays his role as if he is really milkha singh himself farhan akhtar excels playing milkha singh like ben kingsley excelled playing gandhi farhan akhtar seems be enjoying every bit movie when he runs he runs like tiger when he dances he dances like pure punjabi when he loves he loves with innocence passion farhan akhtar can easily be given all best actor awards 2013 all supporting actors give their best divya dutta is excellent sonam kapoor looks fresh pawan malhotra parkash rajs performance are heartwarming music by shankar ehsaan loy is first rate awe inspiring rakeyesh omprakash mehra like expert captain provides movie its uniqueness technical perfection soul purpose like every fantastic experience this also comes with its dull moments movie takes around extra half hour before reaching its finale rangrezz song could have been avoided prolonged sequences milkhas achievements could have been shortened dilip tahil playing pandit nehru looks like missed stroke at end you can safely say you had great time running with farhan akhtar more than 3 hours run your nearest theater now watch this powerful biopic,0.4743333333333332,0.29023809523809524,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,Truly Inspiring... Bhaag Milkha!,"BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is a biopic directed by Rakyesh Omprakash Mehra, starring Farhan Akthar and Sonam Kapoor.The film revolves around the life story of Milkha Singh.Everyone who is associated with this film has done a GREAT job. The directors... the writers... the actors... EVERYONE. When the first look of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag came, we were shocked how similar Farhan Akthar looked like Milkha Singh, and his acting has showed us that not only is he a GREAT actor, but he can mostly do any role by now. His portrayal of Milkha Singh was outstanding.The film starts off a BIT slow, but you manage to keep with its pace. Inspite of the film being 3h10m, you never feel bored; instead, you find yourself stuck in the world of Milkhaji- poverty, love and speed.The replay value of this film is very high. Its very entertaining.The acting, as said above, is very good. Other than Farhan Akthar delivering an award-winning performance, every other actor did a great job. Sonam Kapoor didn't have much to do in the screenplay, but she did it quite well.The film does depend on each person's likes and tastes. A person who enjoys watching the so-called 'masala' flicks, may not enjoy this film due to its different type of story compared to other films. Also, people who can't sit in cinemas for a VERY long time may get annoyed at the fact that its a 3h10m film.But Overall, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an award-winning film. It shows us the life of Milkha Singh through his very own eyes and deserves a standing ovation for its performances, writing and direction.

9.0,Farhan has done wonders,"Few critics, few including Rediff ones whom I look for some good writing, have rated low to BMB. The reason they give is that movie lacks coherence and clarity. Really? I think they should only rate Hollywood movies because whoever thinks this movie is no good does not know what Hindi cinema is. Farhan has done an awesome job, and if I say awesome then it is not for his physique and dialogue delivery but for the transformation, he has gone to become Milkha Singh. We as an audience witness the physical stress and labor that an athlete as likes of Milkha Singh undergo to become a 'flying Sikh'. Hindi cinema celebrates the life of this living legend with songs and drama and music. Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra has done a decent job, still; I fell he could have done a lot better especially in the scenes of Milkha's childhood memories. His attempt of giving the movie an epic convention seriously affected the narrative portion. However, all this can be sided by the grandeur of Farhan's effort. I would like to mention a statement of one of the rediff users who wrote against critics who are undermining the effect of this movie: ""note that 400mtrs is a very difficult race to run. it is at the border of quick races and long jogs. after partition India did not have either the experience nor the infra to produce runners for 400mtrs. So Milkha was a true champion in every sense. If critics pull films like these down for abstract reasonsÂ…we will forever have 20 goons flying in the air with one punch from one man. Grow up critics.""So true.",farhan has done wonders,few critics few including rediff ones whom i look some good writing have rated low bmb reason they give is that movie lacks coherence clarity really i think they should only rate hollywood movies because whoever thinks this movie is no good does not know what hindi cinema is farhan has done awesome job if i say awesome then it is not his physique dialogue delivery but transformation he has gone become milkha singh we as audience witness physical stress labor that athlete as likes milkha singh undergo become flying sikh hindi cinema celebrates life this living legend with songs drama music rakesh om prakash mehra has done decent job still i fell he could have done lot better especially scenes milkhas childhood memories his attempt giving movie epic convention seriously affected narrative portion however all this can be sided by grandeur farhans effort i would like mention statement one rediff users who wrote against critics who are undermining effect this movie note that 400mtrs is very difficult race run it is at border quick races long jogs after partition india did not have either experience nor infra produce runners 400mtrs so milkha was true champion every sense if critics pull films like these down abstract reasons we will forever have 20 goons flying air with one punch one man grow up critics so true,0.5602418745275889,0.1314814814814815,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,"Farhan Akhtar, an epitome of extreme dedication towards the character","I would certainly be disappointed if this movie doesn't get nominated for the best foreign language film in the academy awards. Farhan Akhtar is like the epitome of dedication towards Milkha Singh's character. He was running like a pro. Cinematography was just amazing. Many shots were just breathtaking. Direction was just perfect and the casting was sensibly done. Parallel storytelling kept the movie balanced between Milkha Singh's life and his sports career. The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did their job as always. But one of all, Farhan Akhtar rocked. He has always given his best in every field he has ever stepped in to.

10.0,Farhan Akhter deserves a National award for this!!!,"Well I was not excited enough for this movie, but when the trailers started coming and then the music, my curiosity began to flourish little bit. But the main reason I went to saw this movie was because I heard almost 50-60 review from my friends and not even single person had a negative review against it. And when I saw this, it really blew me away because it had many mixtures which made this movie work. First of all FARHAN AKHTER is at its best, no doubt its his best performance till date. It was like we were seeing real Milkha Singh on screen. Divya Dutta is awesome, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh & Prakash Raj have really performed well. Sonam Kapoor is completely waste though her role was very little, so you won't miss her. Rebecca Breeds looks fabulous, Dilip Tahil as Jawahar Lal Nehru was not a master stroke. Screenplay was good, music was fabulous and the background score really kept the life in each and every scene. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's best work till date also.

8.0,Milkha bann gaya India - A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT!!,"I watched a Paid-Preview of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag last night and I was star-strucked by its fame watching the house-full crowd in the theater (as if it is the first day of the release). When I first watched its teaser in October last year and first trailer in January..it had me going since then, and now I am happy that my expectation was worth it.BRIEF STORY & REVIEW SKETCH. The film is about Milkha Singh and introspects his being through the eyes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. There are no twists or turns in the movie but its just a tale told on a clean slate. Film starts with a defeat in Olympics, carried on when Milkha refuses to visit Pakistan (has his valid reasons for doing so) but Pt. Nehru sends Milkha's latter and former coach to Chandigarh so that they can convince him for the tour. During the train-journey, Pavan Malhotra (former coach) reveals the story of Milkha Singh and his reason to not visit Pakistan to the other two gentlemen which unleashes an assiduous, interesting and penultimate story about the legend. This Sikh has been running his whole life, starting his first race for a glass of milk to the Olympics..and never ending. It reminds me of the great metaphor ' The race of Life'. Milkha Singh ran to save his life, to eat, to dream, for love, for country, for passion and to overcome his own personal fears, ''and what a run it was!''. BMB traces his scarred childhood, brutalized by India's partition ; followed by penury and petty crimes. He finds the purpose of life when he falls for Beeru (Sonam). Joins the Indian Army and since then his passion, eagerness and situations along with the efforts (negative & positive both) made by different people led him to become an athlete, a runner who remained uncased even by his own daemons. He keeps on breaking records but witnesses a heartbreaking defeat in Rome Olympics (1960) but thats not it, he takes it in his stride, overcomes his catastrophic past which was the cause of Olympic defeat and emerges out to be a clear winner.OVERVIEWROPM delivers yet again a tale in his own style (fond of changing tones in his films), where the length is bit of a disappointment otherwise the content heals the flaw with a superb execution and sticky pace, that tops with Farhan Akhtar's outstanding performance (the actor gave his blood n sweat into the character) and he emerges out to be the soul of the movie physically and mentally. The story by Prasoon Joshi is admirable and the track 'Zinda' is well written by him, beautifully composed by Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy and descriptively choreographed by Shaimak Davar. The background score by the trio adds on to the whole movie. The performances from the other cast is noticeable where Divya Dutta deserves a special mention (Hats off to the lady for creating a great impact in spite of having such a small role) The film truly deserves to be one of the best that Bollywood has offered this year so far and I hope to see some more in-depth biopics like this in coming future.I'd rate this dig-till-hell marvel biopic as 8/10.",milkha bann gaya india successful effort,i watched paid preview bhaag milkha bhaag last night i was star strucked by its fame watching house full crowd theater as if it is first day release when i first watched its teaser october last year first trailer january it had me going since then now i am happy that my expectation was worth it brief story review sketch film is about milkha singh introspects his being through eyes rakeysh omprakash mehra there are no twists or turns movie but its just tale told clean slate film starts with defeat olympics carried when milkha refuses visit pakistan has his valid reasons doing so but pt nehru sends milkhas latter former coach chandigarh so that they can convince him tour during train journey pavan malhotra former coach reveals story milkha singh his reason not visit pakistan other two gentlemen which unleashes assiduous interesting penultimate story about legend this sikh has been running his whole life starting his first race glass milk olympics never ending it reminds me great metaphor race life milkha singh ran save his life eat dream love country passion overcome his own personal fears what run it was bmb traces his scarred childhood brutalized by indias partition followed by penury petty crimes he finds purpose life when he falls beeru sonam joins indian army since then his passion eagerness situations along with efforts negative positive both made by different people led him become athlete runner who remained uncased even by his own daemons he keeps breaking records but witnesses heartbreaking defeat rome olympics 1960 but thats not it he takes it his stride overcomes his catastrophic past which was cause olympic defeat emerges out be clear winner overviewropm delivers yet again tale his own style fond changing tones his films where length is bit disappointment otherwise content heals flaw with superb execution sticky pace that tops with farhan akhtars outstanding performance actor gave his blood n sweat into character he emerges out be soul movie physically mentally story by prasoon joshi is admirable track zinda is well written by him beautifully composed by shankar ehsaan loy descriptively choreographed by shaimak davar background score by trio adds whole movie performances other cast is noticeable where divya dutta deserves special mention hats off lady creating great impact spite having such small role film truly deserves be one best that bollywood has offered this year so far i hope see some more depth biopics like this coming future id rate this dig till hell marvel biopic as 8 10,0.48222703222703217,0.25002405002405004,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,A commendable film on Milkha Singh's inspiring tale!,"The sheer joy of watching someones hard-work come to life on the screen is inspiring indeed. To portray Milkha Singh's struggle and achievements and his zeal to succeed at the world stage, required an equally earnest and dedicated effort by the filmmakers. This effort is reflected in Bhag Milkha Bhag, and is what makes the film commendable.Farhan Akhtar's tough physical training for this role pays great dividends on screen. The races look pretty convincing because of Farhan's effort and soon you find yourself cheering for Milkha, if not loudly in the movie-hall then at-least in your head.The non-linear narrative of the film keeps the movie engrossing, so although you know the basic outline of the story, you can't really guess what would happen next. The story is narrated by Milkha's coach Gurudev Singh played brilliantly Pavan Malhotra by who first recognizes the Milkha Singh's talent.The women in Milkha Singh's life play a very important role, be it his elder sister (played by Divya Dutta)who single handedly brings Milkha up, or the love of his life (Sonam Kapoor) who is the reason why he changes his unruly ways. Although one must add, that the part where Milkha goes on a romp after a party with Stella(Rebecca Brooks) during the 1956 Melbourne Games does look a bit forced.Some people may have qualms with the dance sequences but personally they were quite enjoyable and didn't jar the narrative. Keep an eye out for the song with Sonam Kapoor who plays Milkha Singh's love interest in the film. The shot with them both on top of a bridge with green, swiftly flowing water below was captured beautifully.The director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has a signature style which is apparent like from his previous films- Rang De Basanti and Delhi-6. He can merge music and visuals to great effect. Although in some scenes a little bit of restraint in the stylistic details and drama could have certainly helped.To emerge as a world leading athlete from India just after independence, when I suppose sports facilities weren't great, with the scars of the partition deep in his mind is some achievement. We salute you Milkha Singh! One must commend the efforts of the filmmakers to bring the story to us.",commendable film milkha singhs inspiring tale,sheer joy watching someones hard work come life screen is inspiring indeed portray milkha singhs struggle achievements his zeal succeed at world stage required equally earnest dedicated effort by filmmakers this effort is reflected bhag milkha bhag is what makes film commendable farhan akhtars tough physical training this role pays great dividends screen races look pretty convincing because farhans effort soon you find yourself cheering milkha if not loudly movie hall then at least your head non linear narrative film keeps movie engrossing so although you know basic outline story you cant really guess what would happen next story is narrated by milkhas coach gurudev singh played brilliantly pavan malhotra by who first recognizes milkha singhs talent women milkha singhs life play very important role be it his elder sister played by divya dutta who single handedly brings milkha up or love his life sonam kapoor who is reason why he changes his unruly ways although one must add that part where milkha goes romp after party with stella rebecca brooks during 1956 melbourne games does look bit forced some people may have qualms with dance sequences but personally they were quite enjoyable didnt jar narrative keep eye out song with sonam kapoor who plays milkha singhs love interest film shot with them both top bridge with green swiftly flowing water below was captured beautifully director rakeysh omprakash mehra has signature style which is apparent like his previous films rang de basanti delhi 6 he can merge music visuals great effect although some scenes little bit restraint stylistic details drama could have certainly helped emerge as world leading athlete india just after independence when i suppose sports facilities werent great with scars partition deep his mind is some achievement we salute you milkha singh one must commend efforts filmmakers bring story us,0.5507936507936508,0.23828152557319227,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,Bhaag Milkha Bhaag â€“ A Flying Tale of A Flying Sikh,"A great movie experience is a combination of many things. It includes a convincing plot, high voltage drama, light moments that stay with viewers even when they leave the theatre, good music, inspirational elements and a few emotional scenes. ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is among those movies which offer all the above mentioned ingredients at par. For those who keep a track of innovative, interesting and path breaking Indian Cinema the name of Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra is the symbol of excellence. Whenever he unfolded his sleeves, movies like ""Aks"", ""Rang de Basanti"" and ""Delhi-6"" were witnessed by cine-goers. All these movies are distinctive in one way or the other. BMB is nothing different than them. It is a master stroke â€“ without a doubt. Farhan Akhtar secretes immense talent but no one has, up till Rakeysh Om Prakash, utilized that talent. Farhan's directorial ventures ""Dil Chahta Hai"" and ""Lakshya"" made people realize his credibility as one of the finest directors. As an actor, BMB is his landmark. The way he has carried out his role and portrayed his emotions definitely demand standing ovation.BMB is based on the journey of great Indian athlete Milkha Singh (also known as Flying Sikh). It is a movie about a boy whose entire family excluding his elder sister was murdered in the riots of Indo-Pak partition and he became a national and international rage back in 1960's. It is also about the bond between a brother and sister â€“ executed with exceptional detailing. Moreover, the movie is about a blooming romance, some promises with loved ones, emotional fits, flying high yet not leaving the ground by any means and a lot more. In short it's about the life of Milkha Singh and what he went through.Performance wise, Farhan Akhtar deserves to be nominated for this movie especially by critics. He is a revelation in BMB. He tackles the most difficult parts with complete ease and effortlessness. His transitions can be easily witnessed and felt by the audience from first scene to the last. Divya Dutta as Milkha Singh's sister is vibrant, emotional, lovable and above all highly expressive. In 2 of the scenes particularly, she involved the audience to a level by her performance that no one could resist moistening their eyes. This is a performance she will always be reminded of. Sonam Kapoor (as Biro), Meesha Shafi (as Perizaad) and Rebecca Breeds (as Stella) had limited roles but they all performed well in their respective characters. Pavan Malhotra (as Milkha Singh's senior) is inspirational and at his peak. This actor is unfortunately most underrated, he needs to be casted in more movies to show-case his vast talent. Yograj Singh as (Milkha Singh's coach) is just perfect. Dalip Tahil is strictly passable and ditto for Dev Gill (Abdul Khaliq). Art Malik (as Milkha Singh's father) and Jabtej Singh (as young Milkha Singh) are credible and treat to watch.Music of this movie is amazing. Arif Lohar's ""Bhaag Milkha"", Sukhwinder Singh's ""Slow Motion Angrezza"", Suhas Sawant's ""Zinda"" and Divya Kumar's ""Maston Ka Jhund"" are totally different from one another yet are really awesome tracks in all respects. Shankar-Ehsan-Loy's music is simply amazing for this venture.Some sequences to lookout for â€“ performance wise:When Farhan asks from where can he buy the Indian Team's blazer!When Divya Dutta meets young Milkha Singh in the camp.When Farhan insists Divya to wear his blazer â€“ the scene would definitely bring tears to many viewers' eyesWhen Farhan slaps himself repeatedly in the washroomand a lot moreÂ…On the basis of performance, direction, execution and story-telling I would easily rate this movie 9/10. It's a must watch for those who celebrates quality and inspirational cinema.

9.0,An extra ordinary journey of an ordinary person,"Director Mr. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra deserves a standing ovation for selecting and justifying this biopic of Milkha Singh. This type of movie can inspire a generation. Director was so indulged in the film that rather making a film he was just living it. His approach towards every scene is very balanced. Movie length is 3.20 hours but you won't regret for spending this much of time. Even, you enter in film with biased opinion to hate it, slowly movie opens it arms to embrace you and eventually you have to fall in love with it. Screenplay and dialogues by Prasoon Joshi is too good. He has given minute details of the characters very well. When, Milkha Singh prior coaches come to convince him to go to Pakistan, that time he was a rich person, his servant comes with the tea tray but he prefers to make tea by himself and he knows well that how much sugar his coaches prefer. This scene reflects his modesty, honesty and respect without speaking a word. There are so many scenes of this caliber. Dialogues are very balanced, sweet and inspiring. Few of them are "" Unche Udne Wale Parindon Ko Chhote Chhote Darakhton Se Dil Nahi Lagana Chahiye......Main Aapki insult nahi kar raha hun ji, Bas Khud Se Lad Raha Hun...Wahan KI hawa Mein Mere Apno Ke Khoon Mile Hue Hain, main unme sans nahi le paunga"". There was least scope for humor but it is blended with right intensity at right place. Performance wise Farhan Akhter is mesmerizing. This is not acting; it is simply transforming yourself in to the character. Simply awesome. The boy who played, young Milka Singh is amazing. He looks so innocent and fierce. Sonam Kapoor looks adorable. Divya Datta is mind blowing. She can make your eyes moist so many times, with her expression only, without speaking words. Pawan Malhotra as his first coach is very good. Prakash Raji is fine. Music by Sankar Ehsan Loy is completely blended with mood of film. It gives proper pace to film when it requires. This type of films make me proud to be part of this industry. Hats off to complete team of this film.",extra ordinary journey ordinary person,director mr rakeysh omprakash mehra deserves standing ovation selecting justifying this biopic milkha singh this type movie can inspire generation director was so indulged film that rather making film he was just living it his approach towards every scene is very balanced movie length is 3 20 hours but you wont regret spending this much time even you enter film with biased opinion hate it slowly movie opens it arms embrace you eventually you have fall love with it screenplay dialogues by prasoon joshi is too good he has given minute details characters very well when milkha singh prior coaches come convince him go pakistan that time he was rich person his servant comes with tea tray but he prefers make tea by himself he knows well that how much sugar his coaches prefer this scene reflects his modesty honesty respect without speaking word there are so many scenes this caliber dialogues are very balanced sweet inspiring few them are unche udne wale parindon ko chhote chhote darakhton se dil nahi lagana chahiye main aapki insult nahi kar raha hun ji bas khud se lad raha hun wahan ki hawa mein mere apno ke khoon mile hue hain main unme sans nahi le paunga there was least scope humor but it is blended with right intensity at right place performance wise farhan akhter is mesmerizing this is not acting it is simply transforming yourself character simply awesome boy who played young milka singh is amazing he looks so innocent fierce sonam kapoor looks adorable divya datta is mind blowing she can make your eyes moist so many times with her expression only without speaking words pawan malhotra as his first coach is very good prakash raji is fine music by sankar ehsan loy is completely blended with mood film it gives proper pace film when it requires this type films make me proud be part this industry hats off complete team this film,0.5121088435374149,0.21443877551020404,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,"Hardwork , Willpower and Dedication - For person with these qualities , the sky is the limit","Biopics are gaining popularity in Indian Cinema as it is representing true incidents of a person portrayed on the silver screen. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag follows the trend and is thoroughly inspiring and motivating. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tells the real life story of former Indian track and field sprinter, Milkha Singh who is the only Indian male athlete to win an individual athletics gold medal at a Commonwealth Games.From the director of thrilling AKS and rebellious RANG DE BASANTI , Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra gives you another solid-punching true story of Flying Sikh which is also based on the book The Race of My Life. The movie begins with Milkha loosing the gold medal and refusing to participate in Paksitan as he had a troubled childhood during Indo-Pak partition where his parents were murdered. The movie goes into flashback mode showing his transformation from a innocent kid to a trouble-maker youth. Chance to meet his girlfriend changes him completely and he joins Indian Army for good where his racing skills are recognized and from this point , the movie begins to roll out. Couple of scenes will steal the thunder - Farhan Aktar running the race despite the leg injury in National Championship , the practice session shot in Ladakh will chill the blood and finally the beautiful shot climax scene. The screenplay do looses the steam due to avoidable songs , the romantic track between foreign girl and Farhan Akhtar. Editing could have been trimmed for few minutes. Also , I felt apart from ""Zinda"" and "" Bhaag Milkha "" , none of the songs contributed much to the film. Despite these shortcomings , the film boast off some fantastic performances. Farhan Akhtar gives his best as he has trained hard to get into the shape and appreciable sculpted physique clearly reflects in the movie. He emotes so appropriately that it is difficult to think of any other actor in this role. Praveen Malhotra , Yograj Singh , Divya Dutta and Prakash Raj lends in good support.Overall , Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a true tribute to real-life hero Milkha Singh and should be watched by every Indian.

3.0,Run Run Run!,"As I lifted my aching bums from the seat after watching this film the uppermost thought in my mind was a silent thank you to the guardian angels of cinema.After all if this is how we approach biopics I am so happy that Gandhi was made by a foreigner 30 years ago.If Bollywood had a shot at it, they would have made the Mahatma do garba and dandiya with Kasturba and his brave experiments with celibacy would have turned to sleaze.There would have been Zulu dancers during his South Africa phase, soulful ghazals when he visits Amritsar in the aftermath of Jalianwala Baag massacre and sufi songs when Hindu Muslim riots break out.There would also have been some Englishman raping a Indian girl and a sexy mujra in the court of a debauched Maharaja.Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tries to tell the story of India's greatest athlete in the only language that Bollywood understands â€“ the musical.Indeed a sporty musical can be done very well as Lagaan demonstrated but this film simply does not have the material to carry off a handful of songs.It all begins at the Rome Olympics in 1960 where Milkha Singh comes fourth in a photo-finish despite being the world record holder and a favorite to win the race.The reason for his poor showing is a backward glance which according to the film is the massacre of his family during the partition coming back to haunt him.Nothing is further from the truth. Milkha Singh lost because he made a strategic blunder in running too fast during the first 250 meters and tried to slow down which cost him the race.That and his being in lane 5 which creates a blind spot and a disadvantage for a sprinter.So much for a biopic!The film ends with a cricket match final.Now how can that be since this film is about athletics? I am lying of course, the director wisely reduces his race in Pakistan to a India Pakistan war as it happens in every Indo-Pak cricket match and ends the film on a jingoistic note! And yes we take a full three hours to reach this convoluted climax.The story of Milkha Singh is a great story, his lost childhood, his parents murder during the partition, his rise to running glory, his infamous loss at the Rome Olympics which led to him hitting the bottle, his win in Pakistan and him turning down the Arjuna Award.But Mr Mehra finds it more important to dwell on his romance while growing up and his one night stand with a hot Australian girl during the Melbourne Olympics.A chiseled Farhan doing push ups at the beach with a buxum bikini clad blond lying on his back should be paisa wasool!To the films credit the races are filmed with great finesse, the training sequences are epic, Farhan Akthar has a body to die for or to kill for and some of the incidents of his early life are very engrossing. Undoubtedly Farhan as Milkha is a casting coup and the effort he puts into becoming Milkha Singh translates into a superlative performance.The big budget is up on the screen, the attention to period detail is exquisite and Binod Pradhan's camera-work top notch. Pawan Malhotra is downright brilliant as his coach.There is this shot when Milkha Singh get taken over by the coach of the national team and Pawan Malhotra looks at him with an expression that is a mixture of pride and sadness, he is loosing his most talented protÃ©gÃ©e and is happy for him.That shot alone redeems this film.Bhaag Milkha Bhag is a stellar example of a wasted opportunity, this could have been a good film if 70 minutes had been chopped and it could have been a great film if it had focused on Milkha Singh the man and athlete and not on Farhan Akhtar the alpha male with the body of a Greek God.Even after three hours of watching this film we are none the wiser about the profession of running or what it must have been like to be Milkha Singh in the first decade of India's independence or what the legacy of this great athlete is.Bhaag Audience Bhaag!",run run run,as i lifted my aching bums seat after watching this film uppermost thought my mind was silent thank you guardian angels cinema after all if this is how we approach biopics i am so happy that gandhi was made by foreigner 30 years ago if bollywood had shot at it they would have made mahatma do garba dandiya with kasturba his brave experiments with celibacy would have turned sleaze there would have been zulu dancers during his south africa phase soulful ghazals when he visits amritsar aftermath jalianwala baag massacre sufi songs when hindu muslim riots break out there would also have been some englishman raping indian girl sexy mujra court debauched maharaja bhaag milkha bhaag tries tell story indias greatest athlete only language that bollywood understands musical indeed sporty musical can be done very well as lagaan demonstrated but this film simply does not have material carry off handful songs it all begins at rome olympics 1960 where milkha singh comes fourth photo finish despite being world record holder favorite win race reason his poor showing is backward glance which according film is massacre his family during partition coming back haunt him nothing is further truth milkha singh lost because he made strategic blunder running too fast during first 250 meters tried slow down which cost him race that his being lane 5 which creates blind spot disadvantage sprinter so much biopic film ends with cricket match final now how can that be since this film is about athletics i am lying course director wisely reduces his race pakistan india pakistan war as it happens every indo pak cricket match ends film jingoistic note yes we take full three hours reach this convoluted climax story milkha singh is great story his lost childhood his parents murder during partition his rise running glory his infamous loss at rome olympics which led him hitting bottle his win pakistan him turning down arjuna award but mr mehra finds it more important dwell his romance while growing up his one night stand with hot australian girl during melbourne olympics chiseled farhan doing push ups at beach with buxum bikini clad blond lying his back should be paisa wasool films credit races are filmed with great finesse training sequences are epic farhan akthar has body die or kill some incidents his early life are very engrossing undoubtedly farhan as milkha is casting coup effort he puts into becoming milkha singh translates into superlative performance big budget is up screen attention period detail is exquisite binod pradhans camera work top notch pawan malhotra is downright brilliant as his coach there is this shot when milkha singh get taken over by coach national team pawan malhotra looks at him with expression that is mixture pride sadness he is loosing his most talented prot g e is happy him that shot alone redeems this film bhaag milkha bhag is stellar example wasted opportunity this could have been good film if 70 minutes had been chopped it could have been great film if it had focused milkha singh man athlete not farhan akhtar alpha male with body greek god even after three hours watching this film we are none wiser about profession running or what it must have been like be milkha singh first decade indias independence or what legacy this great athlete is bhaag audience bhaag,0.5406831065759637,0.27444444444444444,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,"The True Story of The Flying Sikh"" which became A Masterpiece of Indian Cinema","Bhag Milkha Bhag, the original story of ""The Flying Sikh"", Milkha Singh is inspiring, fascinating, gripping, emotional, personal yet universal. The way Farhan Akhtar played the character is outstanding. But, not only Farhan Akhtar, but also Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (Director), Prasoon Joshi (Script-writer and Lyricist) and everybody has done a great job. The way, it pictured every detail of The Legend's Life is unprecedented. And each important episode has given birth to a historical subplot. From featuring India-Pakistan partition to capturing the erase of the political borders, it is not mere a biopic of an Indian Athlete, who wins medals for India, but it became an epic and witnessed a turmoiled time-span through the eyes of Milkha Singh aesthetically and sensitively. The best part of the storyline is it showed beautifully that Milkha Singh never runs for medals. Instead, he runs for something else, something more personal, something beyond the competition titles. Sometimes he runs for a mug of milk, sometimes for the Indian Blazer, sometimes to forget his failure and overcome his weaknesses, sometimes to overcome his traumatized childhood. It showed how a sportsman can become an icon of a nation and how a legendary sportsman fights and wins his inner-battle simultaneously. It shows, how a Legend uses his nightmares, haunted memories, troubled grown-up times, failures, wounds and scars to make him more strong, more hard-working, more determined, more confident, more focused, more disciplined and more patriotic. It also showed that greatness is another name of politeness, humbleness, modesty and giving proper respect to all those seniors and gurus, who helped the man to become what he is today. The film interpreted Milkha Singh's life and achievements such a way, that it proved again the famous universal truth, ""It doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you go"". On-a-whole, Bhag Milkha Bhag is a masterpiece, a movie of a lifetime and a must watch for everyone.",true story flying sikh which became masterpiece indian cinema,bhag milkha bhag original story flying sikh milkha singh is inspiring fascinating gripping emotional personal yet universal way farhan akhtar played character is outstanding but not only farhan akhtar but also rakeysh omprakash mehra director prasoon joshi script writer lyricist everybody has done great job way it pictured every detail legends life is unprecedented each important episode has given birth historical subplot featuring india pakistan partition capturing erase political borders it is not mere biopic indian athlete who wins medals india but it became epic witnessed turmoiled time span through eyes milkha singh aesthetically sensitively best part storyline is it showed beautifully that milkha singh never runs medals instead he runs something else something more personal something beyond competition titles sometimes he runs mug milk sometimes indian blazer sometimes forget his failure overcome his weaknesses sometimes overcome his traumatized childhood it showed how sportsman can become icon nation how legendary sportsman fights wins his inner battle simultaneously it shows how legend uses his nightmares haunted memories troubled grown up times failures wounds scars make him more strong more hard working more determined more confident more focused more disciplined more patriotic it also showed that greatness is another name politeness humbleness modesty giving proper respect all those seniors gurus who helped man become what he is today film interpreted milkha singhs life achievements such way that it proved again famous universal truth it doesnt matter where you come it matters where you go whole bhag milkha bhag is masterpiece movie lifetime must watch everyone,0.5547619047619048,0.31071428571428567,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.4}"
9.0,Epic. Inspirational. Patriotic,"2013 has been a good year for Bollywood with a number of movies finding the right balance between entertainment and art, such as Special 26, Kai Po Che, and Raanjhanaa. But nothing like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has happened to Bollywood in a long time, maybe not since Chak De India. At once inspirational and believable, there is no way one cannot identify with the pain and the joy of being Milkha Singh, the poster child for India's track and field achievements.One is not born a world class athlete, and the story of Milkha is no different. Who is Milkha Singh? Kudos to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for making us care for this question by humanizing the character to the utmost. He tends to blow hot (Rang De Basanti) or cold (Delhi 6, Aks) but here he is red hot.When it is a Farhan Akhtar movie there has to be flashbacks and non linearity, right (Dil Chahata Hai, Rock On, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara)? The story begins with defeat at Rome Olympics as Milkha repeatedly looks back, and immediately we jump into the reasons for the same in Multan, around partition, as young Milkha, played with exuberance by Japtej Singh is on the run for his life from his parents' killers. Scarred in mind he is brought up by his sister, (a now habitually great Divya Dutt) and straightened from his devious past by the love of his life Sonam Kapoor, and mentored by supportive coaches, Milkha has an arduous path to become the flying Sikh. He might have taken to running just for the extra rations, but his talent, dedication, hard work, and discipline ensures his legacy. This is an out and out Farhan Akhtar movie- he is the heart and soul of it, he is there in every frame. This is a career defining role for him, how much has he grown as a method actor. The amount of effort he has taken to get into the character of Milkha is phenomenal. Right from the look and physique, to the mannerisms and the dressing sense- he is an absolute delight. When he does the bhangra, i bet there are few Sardars who can do it better. The supporting cast comprising of Pavan Malhotra, Dalip Tahil, KK Raina, and Prakash Raj is spot on. The script by Prasoon Joshi has beautifully woven blood, sweat, tears and true grit which makes it such a motivational tale. The music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is spot on, while the cinematography by Binod Pradhan is excellent.Roger Ebert famously said- ""No good movie is too long and no bad movie short enough"". At 3 hrs Bhaag Milkha Bhaag could have been 20 minutes shorter and still had the same impact, but the extra duration in a way just prolongs the involvement. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a stupendous achievement overall. It is a movie and there is over dramatization, but there is a tremendous amount of heart that has gone into it, and hence the indelible impact it leaves- 9/10",epic inspirational patriotic,2013 has been good year bollywood with number movies finding right balance between entertainment art such as special 26 kai po che raanjhanaa but nothing like bhaag milkha bhaag has happened bollywood long time maybe not since chak de india at once inspirational believable there is no way one cannot identify with pain joy being milkha singh poster child indias track field achievements one is not born world class athlete story milkha is no different who is milkha singh kudos rakeysh omprakash mehra making us care this question by humanizing character utmost he tends blow hot rang de basanti or cold delhi 6 aks but here he is red hot when it is farhan akhtar movie there has be flashbacks non linearity right dil chahata hai rock zindagi na milegi dobara story begins with defeat at rome olympics as milkha repeatedly looks back immediately we jump into reasons same multan around partition as young milkha played with exuberance by japtej singh is run his life his parents killers scarred mind he is brought up by his sister now habitually great divya dutt straightened his devious past by love his life sonam kapoor mentored by supportive coaches milkha has arduous path become flying sikh he might have taken running just extra rations but his talent dedication hard work discipline ensures his legacy this is out out farhan akhtar movie he is heart soul it he is there every frame this is career defining role him how much has he grown as method actor amount effort he has taken get into character milkha is phenomenal right look physique mannerisms dressing sense he is absolute delight when he does bhangra i bet there are few sardars who can do it better supporting cast comprising pavan malhotra dalip tahil kk raina prakash raj is spot script by prasoon joshi has beautifully woven blood sweat tears true grit which makes it such motivational tale music by shankar ehsaan loy is spot while cinematography by binod pradhan is excellent roger ebert famously said no good movie is too long no bad movie short enough at 3 hrs bhaag milkha bhaag could have been 20 minutes shorter still had same impact but extra duration way just prolongs involvement bhaag milkha bhaag is stupendous achievement overall it is movie there is over dramatization but there is tremendous amount heart that has gone into it hence indelible impact it leaves 9 10,0.5316362715298886,0.20438196555217827,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.33}"
3.0,Living in its moments and surrendering in its narration,"The Indian film industry's most loud and noisy version Bollywood has survived most of the last three decades without telling any story to its audience. The only creative aspect of Bollywood has been its lilting music which is created by those not so good looking talented singers and musicians who are left to watch beautiful( fare skinned) actresses and actors with chiseled body(Steroids) dance and lip sync over their hard work. So whenever a story does drop by in front of them they stumble and fail to narrate it in front of their audience.'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is one those important true stories that needed to be told by someone other than Bollywood. With its very prejudice and narrow minded thinking it fails to liberate an inspirational personal life story beyond their myopic views. Milkha Singh, the Indian athlete who was one of the few bright spots during the early years of independent India was like his nation lived its childhood in bloody tragedy of partition. Born in a Sikh community in pre-partition Multan, Milkha survived the partition with his elder sister along with her abusive husband. Milkha goes on to survive the hard ships in the refugee camp in new born India by hook or crook. His persona comes off as lively and mischievous. In a very prolonged flashback we are shown his small town love affair and his tryst with the law. The director uses these sequences to insert the usual Bollywood machismo with girls shying from kisses & hugs along with tons of humorous sequences that are inconsequential to the storyline. All these flashbacks are narrated to the secretary of Prime Minister Nehru during his journey by train to Chandigarh to meet Milkha Singh personally at the behest of Mr. Nehru. He is meeting Milkha to convince him to go to Pakistan for the Indo-Pak friendship games to be held in Lahore. He is accompanied by Milkha's athletic Coach in the Army and his current Indian national team coach who are trying to narrate Milkha's reason for not visiting Pakistan.His refusal is due to his childhood traumas based in Multan i.e. now in Pakistan. He watched his father's head being chopped by Islamic fanatics after his father forced him to run away from the massacre. He does not feel any strain of friendship towards the neighboring state.While the narration is about his refusal to go to Pakistan, there is no reference to it for over two hours into the movie until the Secretary himself stops the coaches in between to make them aware of his and audiences dilemma that what has been narrated has very little to do with Mr. Milkha Singh's refusal to head to Pakistan. Throughout the narration we see Milkha join the Indian Army and dance with his colleagues in the dormitory, he grows up being a small time burglar and falls in love with the village beauty and sing and dream and then when he goes to Melbourne Olympics, he falls for a Blonde Australian and they sing and dance. By this time the murmurs and the desperation inside the movie theater is palpable as it is already over two hours. When the movie finally reaches its climax after over 180 minutes we witness a fleeting moment of a real historical sports movie with a race in Lahore that include Asian Champion Abdul Khaliq. The interjecting images of the race watched by Pakistani dictator Ayub Khan (who confers Milkha with the title 'Flying Sikh') and listened around India through Radio it is an easy win for Milkha but an important personal win. And the moment passes away as all the side characters begin to do Bhangra dance for the 100th times as they did for many other inconsequential sequences and occasions.But nothing less is expected from Bollywood makers who are diagnosed with narrative mood swings that could be compared to a bi-polar person. They never stay in the moment of a storyline and try to squeeze out every existing emotion one way or the other.Apart from the sharply written character of Milkha i.e. comparable to his sharply chiseled body none of the characters hold together for more than few minutes. They are either left praising Milkha or being jealous or falling head over heels to fall in love with him. Pakistani athletes are characterized as they way Indians feel they would behave with flaring nostrils and deep disdain for anything Indian (may be Abdul Khaliq did act arrogantly in front of Milkha). But it has to do with some deep rooted feeling for white blonde among the film makers, for the way they portrayed Milkha's two love stories. While his village love is shown in a very asexual manner, where when the couple goes away for privacy they make childish gestures of love towards each other alone, but with the Australian it is filled with sex and booze from first night. May be they do go far off from village to make out, but for Bollywood to show intimacy it is easy way round to hook up with a blonde white woman. Such views and forced dramatization of a very personal story discourages the narrative of the film to go along coherently. Unfortunately Bollywood manages to bring down the story of a national hero to its knees and successfully fares well where every other forgettable Bollywood movies fare; in its moments. In moments during Milkha racing from the pains of running bare feet to running for life, 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' finds its footing that are rare and too few in myriad of drama and Bhangra.",living its moments surrendering its narration,indian film industrys most loud noisy version bollywood has survived most last three decades without telling any story its audience only creative aspect bollywood has been its lilting music which is created by those not so good looking talented singers musicians who are left watch beautiful fare skinned actresses actors with chiseled body steroids dance lip sync over their hard work so whenever story does drop by front them they stumble fail narrate it front their audience bhaag milkha bhaag is one those important true stories that needed be told by someone other than bollywood with its very prejudice narrow minded thinking it fails liberate inspirational personal life story beyond their myopic views milkha singh indian athlete who was one few bright spots during early years independent india was like his nation lived its childhood bloody tragedy partition born sikh community pre partition multan milkha survived partition with his elder sister along with her abusive husband milkha goes survive hard ships refugee camp new born india by hook or crook his persona comes off as lively mischievous very prolonged flashback we are shown his small town love affair his tryst with law director uses these sequences insert usual bollywood machismo with girls shying kisses hugs along with tons humorous sequences that are inconsequential storyline all these flashbacks are narrated secretary prime minister nehru during his journey by train chandigarh meet milkha singh personally at behest mr nehru he is meeting milkha convince him go pakistan indo pak friendship games be held lahore he is accompanied by milkhas athletic coach army his current indian national team coach who are trying narrate milkhas reason not visiting pakistan his refusal is due his childhood traumas based multan i e now pakistan he watched his fathers head being chopped by islamic fanatics after his father forced him run away massacre he does not feel any strain friendship towards neighboring state while narration is about his refusal go pakistan there is no reference it over two hours into movie until secretary himself stops coaches between make them aware his audiences dilemma that what has been narrated has very little do with mr milkha singhs refusal head pakistan throughout narration we see milkha join indian army dance with his colleagues dormitory he grows up being small time burglar falls love with village beauty sing dream then when he goes melbourne olympics he falls blonde australian they sing dance by this time murmurs desperation inside movie theater is palpable as it is already over two hours when movie finally reaches its climax after over 180 minutes we witness fleeting moment real historical sports movie with race lahore that include asian champion abdul khaliq interjecting images race watched by pakistani dictator ayub khan who confers milkha with title flying sikh listened around india through radio it is easy win milkha but important personal win moment passes away as all side characters begin do bhangra dance 100th times as they did many other inconsequential sequences occasions but nothing less is expected bollywood makers who are diagnosed with narrative mood swings that could be compared bi polar person they never stay moment storyline try squeeze out every existing emotion one way or other apart sharply written character milkha i e comparable his sharply chiseled body none characters hold together more than few minutes they are either left praising milkha or being jealous or falling head over heels fall love with him pakistani athletes are characterized as they way indians feel they would behave with flaring nostrils deep disdain anything indian may be abdul khaliq did act arrogantly front milkha but it has do with some deep rooted feeling white blonde among film makers way they portrayed milkhas two love stories while his village love is shown very asexual manner where when couple goes away privacy they make childish gestures love towards each other alone but with australian it is filled with sex booze first night may be they do go far off village make out but bollywood show intimacy it is easy way round hook up with blonde white woman such views forced dramatization very personal story discourages narrative film go along coherently unfortunately bollywood manages bring down story national hero its knees successfully fares well where every other forgettable bollywood movies fare its moments moments during milkha racing pains running bare feet running life bhaag milkha bhaag finds its footing that are rare too few myriad drama bhangra,0.4577138405329896,0.09049739415430907,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.1, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"
10.0,A laudable achievement in inspirational cinema,"Sprinting through the 400m track, Milkha Singh flies with a dream to win glory, with purpose to shine for his country and reason, to overcome his weakness. Honed by expert coaches and disciplined by the Army, Milkha Singh achieves what no athlete could with his background. The finest visionary filmmaker, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (R.O.M) introduces Milkha's childhood to delineate the events and circumstances that made the orphaned refugee a world class athlete. The inspiring real life story is nothing short of epic on the cinema screen with Farhan Akhtar, embodying a soulful portrayal of R.O.M's envisioned protagonist. The parallel storytelling smoothly transitions between the humble beginnings of young Milkha, the events of partition that led to him taking refuge in Delhi's camps and his rebellion against his circumstances that made his coal-blackened hands hold the Indian Army's guns.It wasn't until he went through rigorous training and transformation to fight his inner demons to overcome his horrifying past, that we see Milkha's ultimate success and recognition as the Flying Sikh. It all begins with the race at the Roman Olympics when Milkha Singh failed to clench victory. A distraught Milkha has the opportunity for reclaiming glory in Pakistan, where his original home and memories remain. Partition drove Milkha to the refugee camp in Delhi where he reunited with his sister, only to run away from his circumstances to liberation. Love takes over Milkha's life with the innocent Biro charming her way into his heart. But Milkha's inability to find a respectable livelihood separates him from his love with a newfound ambition. The Indian Army is where he learns about respect and a cross-country trial was where his talent was recognized. While being completely dedicated to running, his affair with an Aussie girl prior to the Melbourne Olympics distracted him from the cause and he failed to qualify. Disappointed with himself, Farhan portrays the raw emotion with punishment in front of the mirror. His next goal is to break the 400m world record and when the aims are that high, so are the training grounds. R.O.M has showcased Ladakh in all its desolate beauty. Farhan's painstakingly developed brawn is that of an athlete and one has to applaud his genuine effort. Over time, Milkha Singh achieves success on the track and unimaginable glory for the nation. With renewed focus and nothing to distract him from running to the finish line, Milkha attains the title of the Flying Sikh with his epic victory.Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has brilliantly visualized an inspiring story of the legend, of course adding his own dramatic elements, and given us a masterpiece to live by. In familiar styling of setting distinct color tones for flashbacks and using ultra-slow motion photography, he greatly enhances the visual feel of several important scenes. Farhan Akhtar had spent days with the living legend, understanding his character while transforming his physique to appear athletic. His dedication to the character and his own contribution to its depiction are truly remarkable feats because you do see him as Milkha Singh and not Farhan Akhtar. Such a performance is to be cherished and must hail accolades at ceremonies. Sonam Kapoor in a brief role as Biro is charming and vital to the story's evolution. Japtej Singh as young Milkha is versatile with his emotions and has a good understanding of the character's circumstances. Divya Dutta is a great talent and has been used wisely by Mehra to bring an emotional balance in Milkha's life. Yograj Singh as National team Coach Ranvir Singh is simply outstanding as Milkha's progressive mentor. Perhaps the most heartfelt and genuine performance is of Pawan Malhotra as coach Gurudev Singh. His emotions are keenly felt and as exemplary an actor as he is, one must appreciate Mehra's casting that brought the best out of him. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's return after a lull period justifies the time spent in creating the score for this film. From the uplifting background score to the petulant theme of Gurbaani that is enhanced by Daler Mehendi's passionate vocals, the trio have variety and pertinence for the film's subject. While Mera Yaar, Rangrez, Slow-motion angreza are tracks that could be edited to make the film tighter, they are still melodious tracks to listen to. Arif Lohar's Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a subtle anthem for his training in Ladakh but its effect is definitely uplifting. The rock version by Siddharth Mahadevan is inspiring and suited to the end credits. Maston ka jhund is catchy, fun and similar to Khalbalee in its effect. But the film's best track is the powerful Zinda that catches the spirit of Milkha Singh. It's the song that works while passing cars on the highway, in the gym, bathroom, while running or even jumping over train compartments. Rakeysh Mehra has adroitly used technologies to enhance the film's emotional feel. Milkha's feet running over sands, him running over train compartments and crossing the finish line in slow motion are visuals that one cannot erase from the mind. He captures the essence of the dedicated athlete for whom running meant more than just a sport. It gave purpose to his life. Prasoon Joshi's writing is yet again commendable and has more impact when visualized by Rakeysh Mehra. The hard work put in by everyone in the film is apparent in its realistic depiction. The sincerity is keenly felt and the passionate portrayal of Milkha Singh is warmly embraced. There might be a song too many and a sequence or two prolonged, but Milkha Singh's story is an important one nevertheless because it reminds us that there are no shortcuts to success. It comes at the cost of sacrifices, buckets of sweat and ounces of blood in its journey. 9.488 on a scale of 1-10.",laudable achievement inspirational cinema,sprinting through 400m track milkha singh

9.0,Bhaag Milkha Bhaag Â… there is no Finish Line!!!,"The most awaited movie of the year, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is the story of one of the greatest athlete India has ever had. A story of achievement & disappointment, milestones & nightmares, passion & apathy. Most importantly a story of grit & determination and the struggle to achieve success besides all odds. To describe or write about a movie of this stature one cannot find enough words to express oneself. But, I will definitely try and summarize it from the heart on the different levels the movie worked for me.I came out pretty impressed with the way Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra has managed to depict the life of ""Flying Sikh"" in a movie slightly over 3 hours and NO, I did not get bored at any time in the movie. The script demanded the detail and though some sequences definitely match upto speed of the man on whom the movie is made, the rest of the film jogs along just fine. The race sequences have been shot very well and the climax is enduring and keeps you on the edge though most of us already knew the outcome.A true account of the life of Milkha Singh, the movie starts with him loosing the legendary 1960 Rome Olympic race and flashes back to his life tracing the journey from his child hood (born in the undivided India now Pakistan) to the great athlete he ultimately becomes making India proud. The various times in his life are brilliantly interwoven into the plot from the time he lands up in Delhi as a refugee from Pakistan to taking up the life of crime and then moving onto the Indian Army which ultimately changes his life. The sequences where the natural athlete in him is discovered by a Services coach and his ambition to wear the Indian sports contingent blazer are emotional yet inspiring. Full marks to Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra for using his signature style of inter-weaving flash backs with the present to tell a story which is not only inspiring but emotional to the core. He has been able to effectively depict how necessity drives a man to ambition and that ambition converts to passion. Mr. Mehra will make you fall in love with Milkha Singh and you'll end up wondering why you never read or heard about this awesome man.Farhan Akhtar has been the best at whatever he does besides acting, including directing & singing, but I am sure he would also be contemplating that this is his best performance till date. There was no Farhan Akhtar in the movie, you could only see Milkha Singh in the movie. He became one with the character that one could not differentiate between the two. His rigorous training sessions to acquire the lean body of the athlete definitely shown in the movie and his dedication matched that of the original Milkha Singh. Some sequences have of course been dramatized for the movie effect but Farhan makes them look so believable, you end up disputing the fact that they actually happened. The part where he tells his coach that he will wear the Indian team blazer one day has makes you want to do the same. Farhan's look is as close to the real Milkha one could get. The original athlete's nuances, the running style and the inner turmoil which he went through has been picked up closest to the original and though it has already been said countless times, no one could have done a better job of portraying this character.Only 2 actors that can be mentioned in the same breath as him are Divya Dutta and Pawan Malhotra. Divya Dutta as Milkha Singh's elder sister, the one who looked after him after his parents were killed, gives a powerful emotional performance and ups the emotional quotient of the movie manifold. Every time she comes on screen you can't help but cry even when she doesn't say much. Pawan Malhotra who has proved himself time and again as an actor, once again proves as Milkha Singh's coach that there no a better actor than him when it comes to supporting roles. The large than life character and the actual influence this coach had on Milkha's life is portrayed by flawless ease and his comprehension of the character adds another dimension to Milkha's character. The young Milkha Singh portrayal by young Master Jabtej Singh is equally brilliant and the intensity the kid showed as the young Sikh makes him a deserving for future accolades. Yograj Singh (cricketer Yuvraj Singh's father) as Milkha's coach Ranvir Singh and Prakash Raj (finally he gets a break from playing baddie in Cop movies) as his unit's commanding officer support the lead character well. Sonam Kapoor as Milkha's love interest gets the best composed scenes, and though she does not have much to say in the movie, she delivers an effective understated performance. Rebecca Breeds from Australia in her first Indian movie gives a pleasant and light performance in the otherwise intense movie.Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, forms an integral part of the movie. The title track ""Zinda"" is something you'd come humming out of the theatre. My favorites were the Army barrack song ""Havan Karnege"" and the ""Slow motion Angreza"" shot in an Australian pub. The music is easy on the ears and difficult to forget.Milkha Singh ran for our country for long and has been remembered for time immemorial. A rare sports person and you can read about him all over the internet. This movie does complete justice to his biopic, both as a sportsman struggle and symbolically conveying that life's struggles don't have a finish line. The movie takes Indian cinema to another level and though there will be many more to come this year, my nomination for the Oscars is definitely Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Irrespective of your preferences this is a must watch for all Indians.",bhaag milkha bhaag there is no finish line,most awaited movie year bhaag milkha bhaag is story one greatest athlete india has ever had story achievement disappointment milestones nightmares passion apathy most importantly story grit determination struggle achieve success besides all odds describe or write about movie this stature one cannot find enough words express oneself but i will definitely try summarize it heart different levels movie worked me i came out pretty impressed with way rakeyesh omprakash mehra has managed depict life flying sikh movie slightly over 3 hours no i did not get bored at any time movie script demanded detail though some sequences definitely match upto speed man whom movie is made rest film jogs along just fine race sequences have been shot very well climax is enduring keeps you edge though most us already knew outcome true account life milkha singh movie starts with him loosing legendary 1960 rome olympic race flashes back his life tracing journey his child hood born undivided india now pakistan great athlete he ultimately becomes making india proud various times his life are brilliantly interwoven into plot time he lands up delhi as refugee pakistan taking up life crime then moving onto indian army which ultimately changes his life sequences where natural athlete him is discovered by services coach his ambition wear indian sports contingent blazer are emotional yet inspiring full marks rakeyesh omprakash mehra using his signature style inter weaving flash backs with present tell story which is not only inspiring but emotional core he has been able effectively depict how necessity drives man ambition that ambition converts passion mr mehra will make you fall love with milkha singh youll end up wondering why you never read or heard about this awesome man farhan akhtar has been best at whatever he does besides acting including directing singing but i am sure he would also be contemplating that this is his best performance till date there was no farhan akhtar movie you could only see milkha singh movie he became one with character that one could not differentiate between two his rigorous training sessions acquire lean body athlete definitely shown movie his dedication matched that original milkha singh some sequences have course been dramatized movie effect but farhan makes them look so believable you end up disputing fact that they actually happened part where he tells his coach that he will wear indian team blazer one day has makes you want do same farhans look is as close real milkha one could get original athletes nuances running style inner turmoil which he went through has been picked up closest original though it has already been said countless times no one could have done better job portraying this character only 2 actors that can be mentioned same breath as him are divya dutta pawan malhotra divya dutta as milkha singhs elder sister one who looked after him after his parents were killed gives powerful emotional performance ups emotional quotient movie manifold every time she comes screen you cant help but cry even when she doesnt say much pawan malhotra who has proved himself time again as actor once again proves as milkha singhs coach that there no better actor than him when it comes supporting roles large than life character actual influence this coach had milkhas life is portrayed by flawless ease his comprehension character adds another dimension milkhas character young milkha singh portrayal by young master jabtej singh is equally brilliant intensity kid showed as young sikh makes him deserving future accolades yograj singh cricketer yuvraj singhs father as milkhas coach ranvir singh prakash raj finally he gets break playing baddie cop movies as his units commanding officer support lead character well sonam kapoor as milkhas love interest gets best composed scenes though she does not have much say movie she delivers effective understated performance rebecca breeds australia her first indian movie gives pleasant light performance otherwise intense movie music by shankar ehsaan loy forms integral part movie title track zinda is something youd come humming out theatre my favorites were army barrack song havan karnege slow motion angreza shot australian pub music is easy ears difficult forget milkha singh ran our country long has been remembered time immemorial rare sports person you can read about him all over internet this movie does complete justice his biopic both as sportsman struggle symbolically conveying that lifes struggles dont have finish line movie takes indian cinema another level though there will be many more come this year my nomination oscars is definitely bhaag milkha bhaag irrespective your preferences this is must watch all indians,0.5756357740228709,0.26780593958013316,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.37}"

10.0,"Do not walk ... RUN to ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag""!","An extraordinary film.In one sense a biopic of a real historical person â€“ Milkha Singh, 'The Flying Sikh', the orphaned emigrÃ© (from the terrible Partition riots that followed the creation of independent Pakistan and India in 1947) who rose to become India's first world-record setting athlete â€“ this movie gives its audience so MUCH more, in so many ways.On an individual level, the Hindi film ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" (2013) takes over from the Stallone classic ""Rocky"" (1976) as a great sport-based 'triumph of the human spirit' story. Yet at a global level this film also succeeds as one of the best movies yet made about the Partition, which inspires much-needed emotional healing for both nations. Many countries, actually, could benefit from this film's message.(The title â€“ 'Run Milkha Run', in English â€“ were Milkha's father's final words.)Farhan Akhtar Â… phenomenal!Mr Akhtar's mindblowing performance here as the title character will make you forget, for a time, that he is also one of India's best directors. (And a producer. And writer. And lyricist. And singer. None of which hats he wears here.) ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" proves that Farhan Akhtar, at 39, has matured into one of the world's finest living ACTORS.He has brought the same honesty, subtlety, and power to this role, as an actor, which audiences have come to expect as a trademark of the films he directs or produces. Mr Akhtar engages you completely, from the opening frame to the last. You will laugh. You will cry. You will think. You will feel inspired to fly.""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" soars on the wings of Farhan Akhtar's performance.The sheer Â… physicality Â… deserves special appreciation. It is no easy thing, for any mere actor to physically embody a career athlete. Mr Akhtar reportedly conditioned and trained for 18 months, to transform his body and his whole manner of movement. The result is on the screen: you will believe you are watching a world champion runner.It's an extra plus that Mr Akhtar, the actor, does so strongly resemble the real Milkha Singh â€“ in build, body type, and the bones of the face â€“ as the historic photographs shown over the end credits clearly reveal.The supporting cast are uniformly excellent, but I single out these four for special notice.Veteran character actor Pavan Malhotra gives a career-breakthrough performance as Gurudev Singh, the army coach who first introduced young Milkha Singh to competitive running. He becomes the audience point-of-access to Milkha's whole backstory.UK-based Pakistani-born actor Art Malik receives â€“ and earns â€“ third star billing, despite limited minutes. As Milkha Singh's father, his character is long dead and only appears in the 1947 flashback sequences. But Mr Malik so deftly projects an intriguing multi-dimensional character that his image, his presence, linger in the mind long after he has faded from the screen.Divya Dutta as Ishri Kaur, Milkha's sole surviving sister. Brilliant! Emotional touchpoint for the whole audience, on both the individual and societal levels.Last but certainly not least: newcomer Japtej Singh, who plays Milkha as a child. Merges perfectly with Mr Akhtar as the adult Milkha; you believe one would grow into the other. Most natural and 'genuine' performance by any child actor that I had seen in years. (May this be the beginning of a long and great career for young Mr Singh!)Chief among technical departments, the strong story structure of ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is a huge plus. The filmmakers chose an unusual starting point to begin telling their story: what might be thought the greatest failure of Milkha Singh's career. (Breaking his own world record, but only finishing 4th â€“ out of the medals â€“ in the 400 meter run at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome.) But through deft intercutting between the then-present and selected flashbacks to Milkha's backstory, the film builds to an unexpectedly powerful climax that emotionally satisfies while inspiring on both personal and global levels.Special credit: without diluting the emotional horror of Milkha's childhood experiences during the Partition, visual horror is kept to a minimum. A very difficult balance to keep, but successfully achieved here. (Note to Parents: film does contain one disturbing image of an athletics injury.)The taut script by Prasoon Joshi and crisp editing by P. S. Bharathi elevate ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" by an order of magnitude above director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's earlier movies (such as ""Rang De Basanti"" (2006) which, though fresh and original, was comparatively unfocused and sprawling in its storytelling technique). ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"", by comparison, is so tightly written and well paced that I never even noticed the three-hour length, the film runs so fast and so smoothly.The music â€“ by Shankar Ehsaan Loy â€“ is so good, so inspiring, that I rushed straight out to buy the soundtrack music CD immediately after leaving the movie!Pretty easily, ""Bhaag Milkha Bhaag"" is THE BEST film I've seen from anywhere in the world thus far in 2013. (This statement includes the Oscar holdovers from year 2012.)

10.0,Must watch if you think Bollywood can not produce great movies.,"When I saw the trailer, I thought this biopic is going to be another Bollywood disaster. But when the positive reviews came from friends on social media, I decided to watch it. Before this I was neither fan of Farhan, nor Sonam's but Rakeysh OP Mehra, I consider as great film-maker so I went for the night show at 10:30 PM assuming that I will be almost empty hall but surprisingly it was houseful and I got seat in 3rd row. IN first 15 minutes, I was sure these 3 hours are going to be ride with goosebumps, excitements. You can feel the pain of failure and happiness of each and every success of legendary Indian athlete Jeev Milkha Singh. Farhan is in so much of depth with this role that you will love it. It is a complete 3 hours treat which gives you a lot of lessons. That it is not easy to succeed. Just a moment can ruin all your efforts.",must watch if you think bollywood can not produce great movies,when i saw trailer i thought this biopic is going be another bollywood disaster but when positive reviews came friends social media i decided watch it before this i was neither fan farhan nor sonams but rakeysh op mehra i consider as great film maker so i went night show at 10 30 pm assuming that i will be almost empty hall but surprisingly it was houseful i got seat 3rd row first 15 minutes i was sure these 3 hours are going be ride with goosebumps excitements you can feel pain failure happiness each every success legendary indian athlete jeev milkha singh farhan is so much depth with this role that you will love it it is complete 3 hours treat which gives you lot lessons that it is not easy succeed just moment can ruin all your efforts,0.4628045157456922,0.3221925133689839,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.32}"
