8.0,Great fun 80s popcorn action movie,"""On March 3, 1969 the United States Navy established an elite school for the top one percent of its pilots. Its purpose was to teach the lost art of aerial combat and to insure that the handful of men who graduated were the best fighter pilots in the world."" So starts this action masterpiece from director Tony Scott. Hot shot pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) gets a chance to attend Fighter Weapons School or Top Gun in Miramar when his lead Cougar loses it in the air. He's met by cold as ice Iceman (Val Kilmer) as his calculating competition. He always has his navigator Goose (Anthony Edwards) by his side. He constantly tries to prove himself running on instinct against his father's perceived failed mission. Top Gun commanding officer is Viper (Tom Skerritt) and Jester (Michael Ironside) is an instructor. Charlie (Kelly McGillis) is a civilian instructor.The action is great. Tony Scott shoots the action like a music video and it looks amazing. He gets great access to military hardware and locations. This is not the older generation military movie. Movie star Tom Cruise is perfectly suited as Maverick. The only minor hiccup is the limited chemistry between McGillis and Cruise. It's not bad and it doesn't detract from anything. This movie just has all the fun 80s stuff. It's funny. It's fun.

7.0,"""Talk to me, Goose.""","Hot shot fighter pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) clashes with other pilots at Top Gun School while trying to prove himself and live down his father's bad reputation. He also makes time to get sexy with instructor Kelly McGillis, who may or may not have lost that lovin' feelin'. What an awesome movie. Who doesn't love Top Gun?

8.0,Classic '80s aerial drama that makes a star of the F-14 Tomcat,"Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell flies F-14 Tomcats for the US Navy with his Radar Intercept Officer Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw. Maverick is a bit of a wildcard with a certain contempt for the rule but when the unit's number one pilot has a panic attack during an encounter with a pair of MiGs he finds himself sent to the prestigious 'Top Gun' school where he and Goose will train and compete with the finest pilots in the Navy. Once there he quickly ruffles a few feathers but also impresses with his flying and is one of the favourites to be top of the class. Away from the flying he gets involved with instructor Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood. A tragic accident during training means he considers whether or not to quit but when a situation arises in the Indian Ocean he takes to the skies again and must put what he learnt into practice.I first watched this film in the eighties, loved it and watched it many times but having not watched it for several years I wondered how it would have aged. Thankfully it was as enjoyable as ever. The story itself is a little cliché but it is well told and the aerial scenes are some of the best in any film I've seen no CGI here. The romantic subplot does feel a little forced as the two leads don't seem to have the right chemistry the relationship between the pilots and RIOs, especially between Maverick and Goose are more interesting than the romance. When the 'tragic event' occurs it is quite a shock and genuinely emotional. The cast do a decent job and it is no surprise that this launched Tom Cruise's career as an action star however the real stars are the Grumman F-14 Tomcats. Director Tony Scott did a great job capturing the action both in the sky and on the ground. Overall I'd say this is a must see for anybody who likes modern military aircraft and those who like decent action.",classic 80s aerial drama that makes star f 14 tomcat,pete maverick mitchell flies f 14 tomcats us navy with his radar intercept officer nick goose bradshaw maverick is bit wildcard with certain contempt rule but when units number one pilot has panic attack during encounter with pair migs he finds himself sent prestigious top gun school where he goose will train compete with finest pilots navy once there he quickly ruffles few feathers but also impresses with his flying is one favourites be top class away flying he gets involved with instructor charlotte charlie blackwood tragic accident during training means he considers whether or not quit but when situation arises indian ocean he takes skies again must put what he learnt into practice i first watched this film eighties loved it watched it many times but having not watched it several years i wondered how it would have aged thankfully it was as enjoyable as ever story itself is little clich but it is well told aerial scenes are some best any film ive seen no cgi here romantic subplot does feel little forced as two leads dont seem have right chemistry relationship between pilots rios especially between maverick goose are more interesting than romance when tragic event occurs it is quite shock genuinely emotional cast do decent job it is no surprise that this launched tom cruises career as action star however real stars are grumman f 14 tomcats director tony scott did great job capturing action both sky ground overall id say this is must see anybody who likes modern military aircraft those who like decent action,0.4335434173669468,0.1531862745098039,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.31}"

9.0,"""I Feel The Need, The Need For Speed""","Top Gun it can be argued is the perfect Reagan Era film and is is definitely the film that cemented Tom Cruise's stardom. It's probably now the film that most people will identify him with.Cruise plays Pete Mitchell aka Maverick who gets recommended for the Navy's elite Top Gun fighter pilot school. The best of the best train here at what they euphemistically call Fightertown, USA. The problem Tom has is he's the best and he knows it. That doesn't near and endear him to his fellow pilots.You can add Top Gun to a list of films that goes all the way back to Task Force where the story of the development of the aircraft carrier was told, to The Bridges at Toko-Ri which was a film that told about the first jet air war in Korea. What Gary Cooper flew in Task Force and what William Holden piloted in The Bridges at Toko-Ri are as ancient to Cruise's generation as what Eddie Rickenbacker flew in the first World War was to Holden and Cooper.One thing that has not left is that war in the air still is the glamor service because it allows a record of individual achievement. And with flying combat at the speeds they do, one has to make less than split second decisions. The men are better now than they were in the previous wars simply because they have to be.Cruise is ably assisted by such folks as Tim Rossovich, Barry Tubb, Clarence Gilyard, Whip Hubley, and Adrian Pasdar as fellow pilots at the Top Gun school. Val Kilmer turns in a nice performance as Cruise's number one rival to be number one in the class.Best in the film besides Tom is Anthony Edwards as his co-pilot and best friend. His death scene with Cruise is particularly poignant as is Edwards's wife Meg Ryan's scene with Tom as he breaks the news.Romance for Cruise is provided by Kelly McGillis who certainly had her choice of hunks to fall for, but this film doe seem to make a point that women like confidence in their men even if it can be overbearing at times to those around. McGillis is a civilian instructor so the romance does not bring Tom or her under military fraternization infractions.Top Gun is a film every bit as good as the ones I mentioned before. Tom Cruise was never more appealing on the screen. And this review is dedicated to the fighter pilots of the United States Navy, some of the best and brightest of the younger generation who are defending freedom for old codgers like me.",i feel need need speed,top gun it can be argued is perfect reagan era film is is definitely film that cemented tom cruises stardom its probably now film that most people will identify him with cruise plays pete mitchell aka maverick who gets recommended navys elite top gun fighter pilot school best best train here at what they euphemistically call fightertown usa problem tom has is hes best he knows it that doesnt near endear him his fellow pilots you can add top gun list films that goes all way back task force where story development aircraft carrier was told bridges at toko ri which was film that told about first jet air war korea what gary cooper flew task force what william holden piloted bridges at toko ri are as ancient cruises generation as what eddie rickenbacker flew first world war was holden cooper one thing that has not left is that war air still is glamor service because it allows record individual achievement with flying combat at speeds they do one has make less than split second decisions men are better now than they were previous wars simply because they have be cruise is ably assisted by such folks as tim rossovich barry tubb clarence gilyard whip hubley adrian pasdar as fellow pilots at top gun school val kilmer turns nice performance as cruises number one rival be number one class best film besides tom is anthony edwards as his co pilot best friend his death scene with cruise is particularly poignant as is edwardss wife meg ryans scene with tom as he breaks news romance cruise is provided by kelly mcgillis who certainly had her choice hunks fall but this film doe seem make point that women like confidence their men even if it can be overbearing at times those around mcgillis is civilian instructor so romance does not bring tom or her under military fraternization infractions top gun is film every bit as good as ones i mentioned before tom cruise was never more appealing screen this review is dedicated fighter pilots united states navy some best brightest younger generation who are defending freedom old codgers like me,0.3875992063492063,0.3619708994708994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,"And all the Air Force got was ""Iron Eagle"" .....","If there's ever proof of the cachet of Naval Aviation, this is it. Those poor Air Force guys got a trio of ""Iron Eagle"" flicks that went from bad to horrible, whereas the Navy flyboys got this great 1980's classic. Sure, it's cheesy and corny, but it makes the cheese and corn taste pretty damn good. A cynic might argue that it's just a two hour long Navy recruiting ad (one that worked for me, two years later I found my ass in Pensacola sweating through AOCS, short for Aviation Officer Candidate School, the program immortalized in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"") but by making a pro-Navy movie, the filmmakers also got invaluable technical assistance from top Navy aviators, and it shows.For starters, although this movie takes numerous liberties in order to entertain, the basic setup, in which fighter pilots from the fleet get sent to NAS Miramar, aka, ""Top Gun"" for intensive training, is 100% accurate. The Navy, back during Vietnam, was getting sick of losing too many pilots in air-to-air combat. The problem, they discovered, was their fighter jocks had been trained for purely long-range missile interceptions, meaning they'd lost their dogfighting skills. And, in Vietnam, several American planes were accidentally shot down by their own side by missiles, so, as a safety factor, enemy planes had to be visually identified, meaning American pilots were back to engaging the enemy at short range, hence the need for dogfighting. The ""Top Gun"" school was started as a result, and the rest is history.Now, back to the movie. Tom Cruise is Maverick, a hotshot pilot but also somewhat unstable. If ""Risky Business"" launched his career as a movie star, then ""Top Gun"" cemented it. Guys wanted to be like him, and women of course lusted after him. The plot is pure formula, but executed with consummate professionalism. The team who put this movie together knew exactly how to push all the right buttons. But the crème de la crème is surely the flying. I don't think that any movie, before or since, has ever rendered air combat in a more convincing and dramatic fashion. For nearly 100 years fighter pilots have been the modern equivalent of olden knights, men who brought a sense of glamour and romance to the deadly art of war, and this movie gives them a fitting tribute.8/10",all air force got was iron eagle,if theres ever proof cachet naval aviation this is it those poor air force guys got trio iron eagle flicks that went bad horrible whereas navy flyboys got this great 1980s classic sure its cheesy corny but it makes cheese corn taste pretty damn good cynic might argue that its just two hour long navy recruiting ad one that worked me two years later i found my ass pensacola sweating through aocs short aviation officer candidate school program immortalized officer gentleman but by making pro navy movie filmmakers also got invaluable technical assistance top navy aviators it shows starters although this movie takes numerous liberties order entertain basic setup which fighter pilots fleet get sent nas miramar aka top gun intensive training is 100 accurate navy back during vietnam was getting sick losing too many pilots air air combat problem they discovered was their fighter jocks had been trained purely long range missile interceptions meaning theyd lost their dogfighting skills vietnam several american planes were accidentally shot down by their own side by missiles so as safety factor enemy planes had be visually identified meaning american pilots were back engaging enemy at short range hence need dogfighting top gun school was started as result rest is history now back movie tom cruise is maverick hotshot pilot but also somewhat unstable if risky business launched his career as movie star then top gun cemented it guys wanted be like him women course lusted after him plot is pure formula but executed with consummate professionalism team who put this movie together knew exactly how push all right buttons but cr me de la cr me is surely flying i dont think that any movie before or since has ever rendered air combat more convincing dramatic fashion nearly 100 years fighter pilots have been modern equivalent olden knights men who brought sense glamour romance deadly art war this movie gives them fitting tribute 8 10,0.4706780538302277,0.13290200138026223,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.41}"
,"TOP GUN rocks, plain and simple","I can't believe the reviews I have read about Top Gun being technically inaccurate, not enough character development, an overall simple and childish plot... gimme a freegin' break! This film was made to look cool, sound cool, and define cool. Yeah, okay, the MiG-28s are really F-5 Tigers; I've read the 'goofs' section before. And Tom Cruise's height. And about 'Maverick going supersonic - I'll be there in 30 seconds,' and the laws of physics preventing him from covering 200 or so miles from the carrier in that time. Whatever! So what! If Top Gun had tried to be accurate and true-to-life in every respect, it would have been some oh-so-serious flick like Courage Under Fire. Here's some examples of what I mean:1 - what's the best way to evade cannon fire? Do a snazzy barrel roll. Problem solved!2 - the MiG pilots have tinted visors. The good guys don't. Go figure.2.5 - Russian planes are actually grey or green. The MiG 28s are black. The Tomcats are... yeah, you guessed it... white! Good vs. Evil.3 - Modern air-to-air combat is usually fought at distances of tens of miles between aircraft. Top Gun uses much cooler spitting-distance WWI era tactics.4 - ""It's too close for missiles. I'm switching to guns!"" Enough said.5 - the generic guy carrying coffee who gets knocked over by the fuming air-control officer. We never see him get up. Classic.6 - even the edited TV version is a few steps above normal-cool. ""... you'll be flying a cargo plane [edit]... out of Hong Kong!""7 - the way Iceman says, ""Mayday, Mav's in trouble. He's in a flat spin, and heading out to sea.""8 - the graceful way Top Gun maintained a PG rating, without using the F-word once.Top Gun came out in 1986. That's 1986. Seventeen years ago.

8.0,Goose was the lynchpin of this fine 80s movie.,"Top Gun personifies the 80s, Reaganomics, the USA vs The Evil Empire. My guess is that if Jimmy Carter won re-election in 1980, Top Gun would be stuck in the bottom drawer of some scriptwriter, or it would have been a talky philosophical black and white movie about the constitutional right to burn the flag, or the fate of the US hostages still stuck in Iran. No doubt the re- election of Reagan in 1984 emboldened the producers to get things moving! And Harold Faltermeyer scored the movie!! Beverly Hills Cop come on down!It's interesting seeing stars being nurtured in Top Gun...Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins, Anthony Edwards. Michael Ironside added much gravitas to this top movie, and somewhat ironically or coincidentally Val Kilmer featured here - two years earlier he was excellent in the underrated Top Secret!

,Because real men play volleyball in jeans,"""What is 'Top Gun'? You think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots? It is a story about a man's struggle with his own homosexuality! It is! That is what 'Top Gun' is about, man!"" - TarantinoTony Scott's ""Top Gun"" stars Tom Cruise as Maverick, a hotshot fly-boy who spends his days bedding babes, flying F14 Tomcats, posing in Ray-Bans, driving motorcycles and dog-fighting vaguely ""foreign"" fighter jets. Cocky but cute, Cruise's character would lead to a 500 percent increase in US Navy applicants. Cruise made cockpits cool.All the criticisms typically hurled toward ""Top Gun"" are true. The film's goofy, homo-erotic, jingoistic, its plot offers the usual Reaganesque war-porn and its style is Susan Sontag's ""fascist aesthetic"" on steroids. Tom Cruise's Maverick, and his fellow ace pilots (Goose and Iceman, the latter played by a scenery chewing Val Kilmer), are themselves called upon to do very little.But bad art can be good. Tony Scott's cinematography was novel for the era, his camera work and cutting were a solid decade ahead of their time, the F-14 is a goddess and Scott's aerial photography has still not been matched. For all its stupidity, Scott's chicks, jets and rock-and-roll aesthetic was new.But new things can be uncomfortably old. Though directed by a Brit, ""Top Gun"" oozes a very dated type of American nationalism. Riefenstahl's ""Triump of the Willis"" for the MTV generation, this is America as she sees herself: the underdog, cocky, righteous, insanely patriotic, casually warmongering and always protecting the free world with a babe on the arm (Meg Ryan) and 40,000 tonnes of tubular metal strapped below the crotch. The necrometrics and megadeaths incurred by Western Imperialism be damned. We look good blowing s**t up. Unsurprisingly, the film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, king of high-octane trash.Like most action movies released in the 1980s, ""Top Gun"" has become a camp classic. Effeminate, prissy and overcooked, the film's 1980's aesthetic (lots of synth, bubblegum pop, stylised sex scenes and sparkling teeth) is today typically viewed as being comically innocent. Others take it dead seriously.7.9/10 – Evil, but some kind of 80s classic.",because real men play volleyball jeans,what is top gun you think its story about bunch fighter pilots it is story about mans struggle with his own homosexuality it is that is what top gun is about man tarantinotony scotts top gun stars tom cruise as maverick hotshot fly boy who spends his days bedding babes flying f14 tomcats posing ray bans driving motorcycles dog fighting vaguely foreign fighter jets cocky but cute cruises character would lead 500 percent increase us navy applicants cruise made cockpits cool all criticisms typically hurled toward top gun are true films goofy homo erotic jingoistic its plot offers usual reaganesque war porn its style is susan sontags fascist aesthetic steroids tom cruises maverick his fellow ace pilots goose iceman latter played by scenery chewing val kilmer are themselves called upon do very little but bad art can be good tony scotts cinematography was novel era his camera work cutting were solid decade ahead their time f 14 is goddess scotts aerial photography has still not been matched all its stupidity scotts chicks jets rock roll aesthetic was new but new things can be uncomfortably old though directed by brit top gun oozes very dated type american nationalism riefenstahls triump willis mtv generation this is america as she sees herself underdog cocky righteous insanely patriotic casually warmongering always protecting free world with babe arm meg ryan 40 000 tonnes tubular metal strapped below crotch necrometrics megadeaths incurred by western imperialism be damned we look good blowing s t up unsurprisingly film was produced by jerry bruckheimer king high octane trash like most action movies released 1980s top gun has become camp classic effeminate prissy overcooked films 1980s aesthetic lots synth bubblegum pop stylised sex scenes sparkling teeth is today typically viewed as being comically innocent others take it dead seriously 7 9 10 evil but some kind 80s classic,0.5355256648113791,0.10640769944341369,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.3}"

6.0,"No real plot, but some fun characters and the odd great quote","Back when I worked in the aviation industry 'Top Gun' was always a big deal. Pilots couldn't believe I hadn't seen it. A lot of them even said it was the reason they pursued that career path. I even have a close friend who has it as their favourite movie. And yet it still didn't really interest me. In fact if there wasn't a sequel coming out for it soon I may never have gotten around to watching it. It always seemed to me, from the little I knew about it, that it was a plotless movie. And having seen it that was a correct assessment. The movie isn't really about anything. The only thing that saves it from being a complete dumpster fire is the charisma of the characters.It's funny to watch a movie so old that the line 'I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you"" is still included and even gets a laugh from the other characters. The film hasn't really aged that well in a lot of ways. The way the action sequences are filmed can make them quite hard to watch. This is something I hope they do far better in the sequel. I certainly enjoyed the characters interacting on land far more than the often quite lengthy action sequences in the air.The film has some memorable quotes which have aged very well. It also has a very good cast who do an excellent job of lifting the film up and making it what it is. It's not a film I can recommend as a must-watch though unfortunately. There simply isn't enough to it for me to do that.",no real plot but some fun characters odd great quote,back when i worked aviation industry top gun was always big deal pilots couldnt believe i hadnt seen it lot them even said it was reason they pursued that career path i even have close friend who has it as their favourite movie yet it still didnt really interest me fact if there wasnt sequel coming out it soon i may never have gotten around watching it it always seemed me little i knew about it that it was plotless movie having seen it that was correct assessment movie isnt really about anything only thing that saves it being complete dumpster fire is charisma characters its funny watch movie so old that line i could tell you but then id have kill you is still included even gets laugh other characters film hasnt really aged that well lot ways way action sequences are filmed can make them quite hard watch this is something i hope they do far better sequel i certainly enjoyed characters interacting land far more than often quite lengthy action sequences air film has some memorable quotes which have aged very well it also has very good cast who do excellent job lifting film up making it what it is its not film i can recommend as must watch though unfortunately there simply isnt enough it me do that,0.4925396825396825,0.17239898989898994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.27}"
8.0,"""Yeah, I guess when I see something, I go right after it.""","I didn't care much for Tom Cruise early in his career, I guess because I equated his real life personality with those of on-screen egotistical characters like Vincent Lauria in ""The Color of Money"" and 'Maverick' Pete Mitchell in the film under consideration here. His jumping up and down on Oprah's couch while advocating for Scientology in 1990 certainly didn't win him any favors in this viewer's eyes. I really have no idea how he is in real life, so it's unfair to paint an unreasonable picture of him based on early observations. I did like him as Nathan Algren in ""The Last Samurai"", and I've enjoyed his take on the Jack Reacher character. ""Top Gun"" was a major breakout role for Cruise and you can see why. His Hollywood good looks stand out strongly and he does have charisma on screen. As a hot shot pilot tapped for advanced flight training at the Fightertown U.S.A. base in Miramar, California, 'Maverick' Mitchell joins an elite group of flyers, some of whom have an outsized ego as big as his.What follows is a fairly formulaic story that follows Maverick as he pursues his air combat maneuver training and rivalry with Iceman Mike Kazansky (Val Kilmer), not to mention a romantic tangle with civilian instructor Charlotte 'Charlie' Blackwood (Kelly McGillis). The chemistry between them didn't work for this viewer, but that might just be me. I thought the repeated strains of 'Take My Breath Away' got a little heavy handed at times, as if you couldn't tell the couple was hot for each other. But it did win Best Original Song at the Oscars, so I guess it fulfilled it's purpose. When Mitchell faces a crisis of conscience with the death of his best friend and co-pilot Goose (Anthony Edwards), he has to summon up the courage and determination to move on. Though he misses out on the Top Gun trophy at Miramar, Maverick pulls through when it really counts in well orchestrated battle action over the Indian Ocean, which re-earns him the respect and admiration of his fellow pilots and officer trainers.Seeing as how this film is over three decades old as I write this, I can appreciate how far Tom Cruise has come as an actor and I have to admit, he's not bad. He's not a favorite, but you can see he's developed his craft. What I would say in criticism of the picture is the casting of Meg Ryan as the redneck wife of Anthony Edward's character Goose. Who at the time thought that was a good idea?",yeah i guess when i see something i go right after it,i didnt care much tom cruise early his career i guess because i equated his real life personality with those screen egotistical characters like vincent lauria color money maverick pete mitchell film under consideration here his jumping up down oprahs couch while advocating scientology 1990 certainly didnt win him any favors this viewers eyes i really have no idea how he is real life so its unfair paint unreasonable picture him based early observations i did like him as nathan algren last samurai ive enjoyed his take jack reacher character top gun was major breakout role cruise you can see why his hollywood good looks stand out strongly he does have charisma screen as hot shot pilot tapped advanced flight training at fightertown u s base miramar california maverick mitchell joins elite group flyers some whom have outsized ego as big as his what follows is fairly formulaic story that follows maverick as he pursues his air combat maneuver training rivalry with iceman mike kazansky val kilmer not mention romantic tangle with civilian instructor charlotte charlie blackwood kelly mcgillis chemistry between them didnt work this viewer but that might just be me i thought repeated strains take my breath away got little heavy handed at times as if you couldnt tell couple was hot each other but it did win best original song at oscars so i guess it fulfilled its purpose when mitchell faces crisis conscience with death his best friend co pilot goose anthony edwards he has summon up courage determination move though he misses out top gun trophy at miramar maverick pulls through when it really counts well orchestrated battle action over indian ocean which re earns him respect admiration his fellow pilots officer trainers seeing as how this film is over three decades old as i write this i can appreciate how far tom cruise has come as actor i have admit hes not bad hes not favorite but you can see hes developed his craft what i would say criticism picture is casting meg ryan as redneck wife anthony edwards character goose who at time thought that was good idea,0.4771924603174604,0.21256944444444442,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,I always liked a bit of cheddar,"Absolute cheese on a stick, but Top Gun proves that that's not always a bad thing. This movie's got everything - an arrogant prodigy who'd be out on his arse if he wasn't so good, a sensible, uglier best friend, a love interest (although she's a bit of a mess), an arch nemesis and his dumb sidekick, a few cool high fives and catchphrases, an emotional death scene, a euphoric victory scene and of course, some unforgettable action scenes. What more could any red-blooded child of the eighties ask for!? And anyone born around 1980 will remember how everyone was doing that double high five and saying 'talk to me, goose' to the kid next to them in class. Certainly one of my all time favourites.",i always liked bit cheddar,absolute cheese stick but top gun proves that thats not always bad thing this movies got everything arrogant prodigy whod be out his arse if he wasnt so good sensible uglier best friend love interest although shes bit mess arch nemesis his dumb sidekick few cool high fives catchphrases emotional death scene euphoric victory scene course some unforgettable action scenes what more could any red blooded child eighties ask anyone born around 1980 will remember how everyone was doing that double high five saying talk me goose kid next them class certainly one my all time favourites,0.44059523809523804,0.21064935064935064,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,This has become a genuine modern classic.,"I just watched this again in preparation for the 2020 sequel where, I believe, Maverick returns as an instructor. I watched it at home on one of the more recent DVD versions in widescreen format and with DTS surround sound. With a good home theater system, including a good powered subwoofer, the sound track is amazingly good.This may be the role that defined Tom Cruise more than any other, as Navy fighter pilot, code named Maverick. In his back story his dad had been a fighter pilot killed in the 1960s in Vietnam and Maverick seemingly has spent his life living up to, or exceeding, his dad's legacy. Most of the story here takes place in California at Top Gun school where the top 1% Navy pilots compete for number one.Cruise was probably 23 during filming, the cast has several other 20-something actors who went on to good careers in film. I know it has some cheesy parts but overall this is a fine movie that entertains and deserves its place among modern classic movies.",this has become genuine modern classic,i just watched this again preparation 2020 sequel where i believe maverick returns as instructor i watched it at home one more recent dvd versions widescreen format with dts surround sound with good home theater system including good powered subwoofer sound track is amazingly good this may be role that defined tom cruise more than any other as navy fighter pilot code named maverick his back story his dad had been fighter pilot killed 1960s vietnam maverick seemingly has spent his life living up or exceeding his dads legacy most story here takes place california at top gun school where top 1 navy pilots compete number one cruise was probably 23 during filming cast has several other 20 something actors who went good careers film i know it has some cheesy parts but overall this is fine movie that entertains deserves its place among modern classic movies,0.3743589743589743,0.2538461538461539,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.09, 'Fear': 0.35}"
7.0,Flying Against a Ghost,"There are few movies that are considered classics that I have yet to see, but Top Gun was one of them. I was pretty tired of hearing the endless references and not understanding them, so I decided to finally sit down and give it a shot. It's enjoyable, but I think it was more of a product of it's time. It's better appreciated as an 80's film than a film in general. Now I don't mean that the effects don't hold up, because they do. I just feel like it had all the fruit at the right time, where as now some of them might be expired or just not as popular. Whether it was 'Take My Breath Away', a smash hit at the time, or Tom Cruise, a blossoming superstar actor, Top Gun is a good movie that was definitely considered great back in the day.Maverick, one of the most famous film characters of all time, learns to become not just a better Navy pilot, but a more well rounded man. Tom Cruise has been better for sure but he has some fun with this role. But when you look at Collateral and even last years Edge of Tomorrow, Cruise is a legitimate actor, but I think at this point in his career he was just trying to make it big. He's extremely cocky and not particularly fond of anybody trying to tell him what to do. He needs wisdom and a life altering event that humbles him. Well he definitely gets both of those. But his cockiness is why the character became so famous. It's one of the main reasons why I think a sequel could be both great and potentially unnecessary. We go on a journey with Maverick throughout the film. A journey that changes his character quite a bit, so I'm not sure a second look at his character works. On the other-hand, knowing where his character ends up, it can be an interesting passing of the torch story if you will.What I think was missing here was more of a back story with Maverick. We get a little bit with his father and a quick remark about his mother, but I would have liked to see more of how he became so cocky and conceded. I did enjoy the romance between Cruise and Kelly McGinnis, who has some of the most stunning eyes you will ever see. You can tell she was one of the few people that could get to him and help him through all the troubles he ends up going through.+Effects hold up +Kilmer and McGinnis' performance +Music -Needed more back story -Too much of an 80's product 7.0/10",flying against ghost,there are few movies that are considered classics that i have yet see but top gun was one them i was pretty tired hearing endless references not understanding them so i decided finally sit down give it shot its enjoyable but i think it was more product its time its better appreciated as 80s film than film general now i dont mean that effects dont hold up because they do i just feel like it had all fruit at right time where as now some them might be expired or just not as popular whether it was take my breath away smash hit at time or tom cruise blossoming superstar actor top gun is good movie that was definitely considered great back day maverick one most famous film characters all time learns become not just better navy pilot but more well rounded man tom cruise has been better sure but he has some fun with this role but when you look at collateral even last years edge tomorrow cruise is legitimate actor but i think at this point his career he was just trying make it big hes extremely cocky not particularly fond anybody trying tell him what do he needs wisdom life altering event that humbles him well he definitely gets both those but his cockiness is why character became so famous its one main reasons why i think sequel could be both great potentially unnecessary we go journey with maverick throughout film journey that changes his character quite bit so im not sure second look at his character works other hand knowing where his character ends up it can be interesting passing torch story if you will what i think was missing here was more back story with maverick we get little bit with his father quick remark about his mother but i would have liked see more how he became so cocky conceded i did enjoy romance between cruise kelly mcginnis who has some most stunning eyes you will ever see you can tell she was one few people that could get him help him through all troubles he ends up going through effects hold up kilmer mcginnis performance music needed more back story too much 80s product 7 0 10,0.5145129870129869,0.2117604617604618,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.36}"

9.0,Rebel without a flight course,"Of course I had to watch this before going into the new one. Maverick - what great nick names they gave them. I think they keep that tradition with the new one. Not sure if they have to jump through hoops or make sure they abide by rules this time around too. I can only imagine what that movie right here did for recruitments back in the day. And I believe the new one might do something similar too.The way it starts ... just so good. I mean they say the music by Lady Gaga for the new one is great. I am curious to see or rather hear that. I mean the soundtrack on this is ... of the hook ... or radar? I reckon radar is a better way to describe it - pun granted. The movie overall has that vibe. It also has a lot of male .. energy. I can understand that some people feel that this means that it also says a thing or two about the sexuality of the characters involved. And I am not blaming anyone who thinks or gets that vibe. Especially if it makes the movie more enjoyable for you.That being said, this really has some fine drama and action scenes in it. Now there is some lingo in this and certain scenes that I am not entirely sure I was able to follow. But you are never lost while watching. Which is the most important thing in my humble opinion. Also we have a lot of close ups during the flights scenes - and even with masks on, there is a lot you get from those scenes.The chemistry between the guys (no pun intended), but also between Tom Cruise and McGillis is oozing of the screen. There are ups and downs (excuse the pun), but you will be on the edge of your seat throughout.

7.0,"He's dangerous, but he can be our wingman anytime.","Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell is a hot shot super jet pilot in waiting. Trouble is is that he has a disregard for authority and carries around a family burden into the bargain. Selected for training at the Top Gun school in San Diego, Mitchell must harness his ability and realise his dreams, or else face the consequence.Top Gun is a golden film, why you ask? Well it's one of those oddities that most people know is actually not very good in substance, yet it amazingly stands up as a secretly closeted treasure from an enigmatic cinematic time. Top Gun can probably lay claim to being the definition of the 80s pop picture, blaring music coupled with tremendous action sequences are oddly offset by the formulaic sub-plots happening down on the Top Gun floor. Yes the film has no substance, but director Tony Scott and scallywag producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer merged a number of crowd pleasing elements to create a box office smash, and in the process launch one time poster boy Tom Cruise into the stratosphere of super stardom.We have a military setting, daring do training programme, buff bodies for those of any sexual persuasion, competitive edginess, and of course the obligatory love interest romance that here is as unlikely as it is actually forced. Tho to be fair to both Cruise {great and cocky} and Kelly McGillis {miscast and poor}, their love scenes are tender and comfortably raising the pulse beat in 80s cinema sensuality. Much macho posturing drips from every other frame, be it Cruise tearing around on his motorcycle or Val Kilmer {Iceman} pumping out his bare chest and smirking away. It could be said that Top Gun is an advertisement for the homo-erotic army! Yet in spite of its obvious daftness, Top Gun is very much a thrill ride. Disengage yourself from the preposterous nature of events out of the sky, and it royally entertains as an action picture of worth. Zooming jet sequences and sparky man to man beefcake exchanges more than make this a worthy revisit, especially now in this HD and booming home cinema age.It's not great for sure, and anyone really proclaiming it to be as such has been having MTV filtered into their brains for the last 20 years. But it is an entertaining film, and the people involved with it knew exactly what they was doing, and when one looks at the ream of poor imitations that have followed over the years?

8.0,Trouble at Mach Speed,"Troubled by accusations that his deceased father was somehow disgraced as a pilot in a fateful combat sortie during the Vietnam War, ""Pete 'Maverick"" Mitchell"" (Tom Cruise) exhibits a reckless nature while at the same time trying to be the best fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy.

6.0,Entertaining no brainer,"Top Gun is a high quality, visually stunning film that does all it can to take your breath away. It is the excellently choreographed dog fights that remain in the mind longer than anything as they are high octane, dazzling bursts of excitement which bring the film to life. However, fighter jet sequences do not make a film and it is the plot where Top Gun has some occasional problems.Parts of the story are overly cheesy and clichéd. The proud to be American theme is dire, repetitive and anyone who dislikes over patriotism in films will despise this. The story line involving Tom Cruise and Tom Skerrit approaches boredom and is the pinnacle of Top Gun's cheese. 'Cheese' is OK, as long as it is not serious and that is where that specific story line falls flat. The fun cheesy parts are some of the films best moments. The volleyball scene is truly a classic and the four actors involved are genuinely enjoying themselves. The relationship between Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards is also very moving at times and the dynamic they have makes for great viewing.The acting is what saves Top Gun from being Tinsel town garbage. Tom Cruise launched his career with this film. His cocky smile makes him perfect for this role and Cruise does fantastically at portraying a determined, passionate character. It is the emotional scenes where Cruise really sets himself apart from his peers. Cruise provides the few scenes where the audience are made to feel any emotion and he carries out his responsibility creditably. Anthony Edwards as Goose is also effective as the man who takes second spot to Cruise's Maverick. He is instantly popular with the audience with his wit, humour and charm. Val Kilmer and Rick Rossovich are great as the rivals. They play off each other really well and do a fantastic job to personify arrogance. Michael Ironside does what he does best and once again, manages to go through a whole film without smiling.The story between Cruise and Kelly McGillis is very romantic and sensual. The heat between them is conveyed very well on screen and it is this that sets Top Gun above films such as Iron Eagle and Chuck Norris films.Berlin's 'Take My Breath Away' is a song that still gets a good deal of airplay and suits this film to perfection; it's cheesy and its 80s. The music is very effective at setting the mood and complements the feel of the film.Top Gun is a film that achieves its objectives, to entertain.

Released in 1986, the film was a massive blockbuster, but aside from marveling over its technicalities and surface glitz, it is a near indefensible film, even as far as popcorn summer flicks go.The plot – if one chooses to lavish such a description on it – basically focuses on a group of crème de la crème aerial fighter pilots who attend an elite flight school in California and compete to see who will be Top Gun.So much for the plot! The focal character is a cocky, swaggering air jockey named Maverick, played with exuberant arrogance by Tom Cruise. All of the pilots spend their days either doing absurdly risky aerial acrobatics or preening around like peacocks displaying their plumage. Maverick functions as a veritable checklist of clichés for the modern action hero. His dead father was a pilot legend, but with a cloud hanging over him, which gives Maverick major daddy issues. The new adviser at the school just happens to be Kelly McGillis, the sexy woman that Maverick tried to pick up at the local bar the evening before with an embarrassing Righteous Brothers serenade (only the film seems to think it is charming!). Maverick's best friend is a pre-ER Anthony Edwards, who is a funny and sensitive family man married to ditzy Meg Ryan. And given that he is stuck with the nickname of Goose when all the other guys have coy macho nicknames like Iceman, Wolfman and Viper, you get the correct impression that this will be the film's sacrificial lamb to give Maverick his crisis in swaggering. Maverick also has a rivalry with another flyer, played by Val Kilmer, but since that plot thread is forgotten almost as soon as it is introduced, it seems pointless to comment on it.The film has been rightfully accused of heralding in the era of ADHD-action filmmaking, drowning in jingoism, featuring blatant homoeroticism and being little more than a feature length music video. The fact that there is some truth to all of those accusations may make the film seem like great dumb fun or a guilty pleasure, but that overlooks the fact that it is mind-deadeningly tedious.Director Tony Scott provides slick direction and the cinematography is spectacular, but nothing can detract from the fact that the film is emotionally lifeless and intellectually vacant. There are literally entire passages that seem to be nothing more than extended music videos. The film is bookended by aerial dogfights against faceless unknown enemies. Who are they and what are their nefarious plans? The film doesn't care. This may well be the first action film ever that fails to feature either a villain or any identifiable central conflict. Which pilot will become Top Gun at the flight school? The film could also care less about that since it is treated as irrelevant. In fact, precious few things seem to matter in this morass of noise than the next flashing light, billowing flag or whizzing plane.Bad film aficionados can laugh over the film's introduction of McGillis as our country's foremost expert aerial tactician, who has never set foot in a cockpit. Cruise and McGillis have a nonexistent sexual chemistry and spend the duration of the film lobbing their lines at each other like grenades and staring with such intensity that one fears a detached retina. Truthfully, there is nothing wrong with McGillis's acting here, but she is included in the film for only two cynical reasons. First, every action film must have ""the girl"". Second, because her character attests to the red-blooded heterosexuality of our leading man.The second is apparently important because Scott often depicts the hunky pilots as sex objects. They are often parading around in tighty-whities or precariously balanced towels fresh from the shower trying to out-macho each other and filmed with the blatant sexuality of a Calvin Klein perfume commercial. One lengthy sequence depicting a volleyball game is completely pointless to the film unless it is needed to pad the time out or the film wishes to showcase the sweaty bodies of the guys in tiny shorts – you be the judge. Of course, since the film refuses to step outside of PG-rated territory lest they lose their target audience of intellectually stunted adolescents, there is no actual nudity. In truth, while all of the displays of male skin are initially enticing, like the film itself, it becomes an annoyingly empty tease after a while.Although many have forgotten it, Cruise has demonstrated some great acting. While he is ideally iconic and definitely at his sexiest as Maverick, it becomes a thundering bore to watch him reduced to repeatedly strut across the screen with a smarmy grin plastered to his face and offer little else. Edwards turns in the film's best performance as Goose, largely because he is allowed to be affable and appealing without being saddled with the obnoxious posturing of some of the other characters. Tom Skerritt is on hand to provide a bit of maturity as a semi-mentor, but the remainder of the cast including Kilmer, John Stockwell, Tim Robbins, have literally nothing to do but function as scenery.Arguably the film's greatest weakness is that we have no rooting interest in anything that transpires on screen. Nothing seems credible, threatening or of any urgency. The film seems placidly laid-back about everything – including its action sequences, which will fail to lift the pulse of the most non-demanding viewer. Although this has been elevated as a somewhat dubious icon of 1980s filmmaking, this may well be the first hit action film with a complete lack of humor and a dearth of any real action.",spectacular
