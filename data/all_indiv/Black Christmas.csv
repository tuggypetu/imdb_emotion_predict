1,A DISGRACE to the 1974 Classic!!!,"And I thought the 2006 remake was bad? HA. This one makes it look like a great movie! Seriously guys, this movie had no quality plot, writing, thought, or direction. The characters were exceptionally bad and unlikable and had no depth. The scares were clich√© and very unoriginal. It's a total introvert to the 1974 cult classic. The original actually had suspense, a creepy atmosphere, scary scenes, and an effective direction. This one had none of those things...

3,Very poor,"Another day, another remake of the 1970s classic BLACK CHRISTMAS, but this time unrecognisable from both the original and first remake. This time around we get a supernatural plot that goes into a completely different direction to the others. I'm happy with that, I don't like watching re-runs of the same old thing, but as a film by itself this proves to be pretty appalling. The plotting is ridiculous, the characters two-dimensional at best, and the subdued tone works against it. A few predictable kills and jumps are all you get with this would-be horror/thriller combo.",very poor,another day another remake 1970s classic black christmas but this time unrecognisable both original first remake this time around we get supernatural plot that goes into completely different direction others im happy with that i dont like watching re runs same old thing but as film by itself this proves be pretty appalling plotting is ridiculous characters two dimensional at best subdued tone works against it few predictable kills jumps are all you get with this would be horror thriller combo,0.515,0.09637254901960789,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.5, 'Sad': 0.0, 'Fear': 0.31}"

1,Don't let the title fool you...,"Because the only plot points that this film shares with the 1974 horror film of the same name is that it is Christmas and female college students are being murdered. This thing is really an insult to that 1974 slasher. The 2006 version has its own problems, but that's another story.It's aiming for a social justice theme, and such films can be good if you have interesting and nuanced characters and a good plot. ""Just Mercy"", from just last year, was such a film, and I'm not sure why it isn't better known. But unlike ""Just Mercy"", this film presents all but a couple of its characters as shrill stereotypes.It's just a case of bad filmmaking. The players launch into speeches about what is happening in the plot either because the filmmakers think the audience isn't smart enough to figure things out, or because they realize they are doing a poor job of storytelling and have to use these speeches so everybody can go ""Oh, I get it now!"". I'm going with the latter. All of the horror scenes seem truncated to the point that you don't really know what happened to individual characters other than probably something really bad. This most likely has something to do with the PG-13 rating, and although there are ways of doing PG-13 horror that work, none of those methods are being employed in this movie.As for the end? The heroines wouldn't originally go to the cops because they couldn't explain three dead bodies in their house. How will they explain what happens at the end? As for Cary Elwes, without giving anything away, his speeches in The Princess Bride were good practice for what goes on here, but then that was a timeless satire. This is just a bad film.",dont let title fool you,because only plot points that this film shares with 1974 horror film same name is that it is christmas female college students are being murdered this thing is really insult that 1974 slasher 2006 version has its own problems but thats another story its aiming social justice theme such films can be good if you have interesting nuanced characters good plot just mercy just last year was such film im not sure why it isnt better known but unlike just mercy this film presents all but couple its characters as shrill stereotypes its just case bad filmmaking players launch into speeches about what is happening plot either because filmmakers think audience isnt smart enough figure things out or because they realize they are doing poor job storytelling have use these speeches so everybody can go oh i get it now im going with latter all horror scenes seem truncated point that you dont really know what happened individual characters other than probably something really bad this most likely has something do with pg 13 rating although there are ways doing pg 13 horror that work none those methods are being employed this movie as end heroines wouldnt originally go cops because they couldnt explain three dead bodies their house how will they explain what happens at end as cary elwes without giving anything away his speeches princess bride were good practice what goes here but then that was timeless satire this is just bad film,0.5093915343915343,0.05825396825396829,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.42}"

1,Completely inept feminist claptrap,"The original Black Christmas is a cult favorite, if only because of Olivia Hussey and the little well-known anecdote that it inspired John Carpenter to write Halloween. Sadly, since the 70's the ""teen slasher"" genre has been done to death (no pun intended), and whilst films like You're Next and Happy Death Day attempt to breathe life into a stale formula, we haven't really seen a great slasher film this side of the noughties.This brings us to 2019 and the latest Black Christmas remake, which desperately wants you to take notice of its existence. It wants you to know that it's sincere, and hip and ""cool"" because it taps into the feminist movement. The first remake of Black Christmas was torn apart by critics in 2006 for its gratuitous violence and paper-thin female characters. The latest remake, helmed by Sophia Takal (who also contributed to the screenplay) fixes that by giving the female characters empowerment and an agenda. Think Charlies Angels with a bit of When a Stranger Calls and half a dozen fairy lights thrown into a slop bucket and you sort of get the idea. I am all for strong female characters. Laurie Rhodes from the aforementioned Halloween and Ripley from Alien are just two classic examples of empowered female leads in a horror franchise. Both of these characters are constantly one step ahead of the (usually male) antagonist and it reminds us that female characters are not only equal to their counterparts, but they often become a force to be reckoned with.Black Christmas (2019) spends so much time telling us that the female characters are awesome that it forgets to develop any of their actual character. Most of the female characters might as well be referred to as ""Girl 1"" and ""Girl 2"" because their sole reason for being on screen is to be quickly bumped off in festive fashion. In a film that is clearly influenced heavily by the MeToo movement, to have such weak characters is detrimental to the whole saccharine message the film wants to convey.The male characters, most of whom are Fraternity Jocks are presented as either creepy, misogynistic or both. This film wants us to root for the female characters by forcing us to swallow the idea that the male characters are all wicked and degrading jerks. There is even a jolly festive song about sexual assault thrown in for good measure. This all makes no sense when a film about empowerment of the gender resorts to doing the very thing it is supposedly criticizing to get its point across.Of the film itself, Black Christmas (2019) is decidedly dull. The original was a creepy little penny-dreadful type chiller. The remake was gratuitous fluff but it at least gave gore-hounds something to lap up. This one is both bloodless (physically and metaphorically) and is about as scary as a Christmas candy cane. The script feels like something out of a high school amateur production and most of the cast overact and chew the scenery. To achieve a PG-13 rating the violence was toned down so much that this feels like something off The Haunting Hour. All of the kills are off screen and so much time is spent with long and drawn out conversations between the female leads that even the short running time seems to drag on, and on and on. The film takes itself far too seriously, but then pulls the rug from under our feet right at the end when the ""twist"" is revealed. I won't spoil what happens, but the supernatural element that they tacked on did not make any sense and just made the whole thing even more ridiculous.Watch the original.

2,Black Christmas (2019),"We live in an age where even remakes get remakes. That is the case with Black Christmas. I liked the original enough for an aged slasher from the 70s. Even the remake, which I re-watched a few years back was mildly entertaining. So I thought, another update while wildly unnecessary, would still be a good watch. Boy, was I wrong. This film is so boring and all around terrible that is very much so the worst movie I've seen in 2019. The film is about a group of sorority sisters who want to bond over the holidays and also spend time to uncover the men in a local frat who have committed crimes against them. However, it turns out members of the sorority start getting murdered right after receiving texts from someone impersonating the controversial founder of the college that they attend. This film stars Imogen Poots, Cary Elwes, and a bunch of terrible actors no one cares about. Not only is this film mind numbingly boring for an hour, its overbearing theme of modern feminist and touching on modern women v men issues completely takes away from anything the film wants to build up. It was so off putting, the dialogue ludicrously bad. I feel like this script was written by a high school student who likes to go to parties, and goes on Twitter to glaze over whatever people are outraged about.The acting is no good, although Poots tried her very best. The scares are so predictable, there's no interest in who the killer is because I was so far removed from interested. You can make a good film that is strong on feminsm without being so on the nose about it! These characters are all so shallow and blend into one another.Also, the plot gets so horrendously bad as it goes along holy cow. People at the cinema were audibly annoyed with the ridiculous writing. This is certainly the worst film I've seen all year and makes it predecessors look like absolute classics. Do yourself a favor, and don't make the mistake of seeing this crap. 2/10",black christmas 2019,we live age where even remakes get remakes that is case with black christmas i liked original enough aged slasher 70s even remake which i re watched few years back was mildly entertaining so i thought another update while wildly unnecessary would still be good watch boy was i wrong this film is so boring all around terrible that is very much so worst movie ive seen 2019 film is about group sorority sisters who want bond over holidays also spend time uncover men local frat who have committed crimes against them however it turns out members sorority start getting murdered right after receiving texts someone impersonating controversial founder college that they attend this film stars imogen poots cary elwes bunch terrible actors no one cares about not only is this film mind numbingly boring hour its overbearing theme modern feminist touching modern women v men issues completely takes away anything film wants build up it was so off putting dialogue ludicrously bad i feel like this script was written by high school student who likes go parties goes twitter glaze over whatever people are outraged about acting is no good although poots tried her very best scares are so predictable theres no interest who killer is because i was so far removed interested you can make good film that is strong feminsm without being so nose about it these characters are all so shallow blend into one another also plot gets so horrendously bad as it goes along holy cow people at cinema were audibly annoyed with ridiculous writing this is certainly worst film ive seen all year makes it predecessors look like absolute classics do yourself favor dont make mistake seeing this crap 2 10,0.6188198757763977,-0.11288961038961037,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.32, 'Fear': 0.28}"
4,You messed with the wrong slasher,"No one was expecting a remake of Black Christmas, nor was anyone asking for it. And its sudden announcement in June was like snow on one's head. What kind of interest can there be in the cult proto-slasher of 1974? Especially after the notorious 2006s remake, which many still either recall as a nightmare or consider it a comedy because of its torture, plot holes, and the ridiculous killer's background? These two Black Christmases would remain a typical tandem of the ""80s original / XXI century studio alteration"", but...The rights to the concept were bought by Blumhouse with director Sophia Takal and screenwriter April Wolfe to lead the newest incarnation. Takal had previously shot some lazy indie thriller about mean female friendship and a full-length episode of the anthology series ""Into the Dark"" ...also about mean female friendship. And with New Year's entourage. Obviously, everything starts there. These two saw the opportunity to depict all of their modern ideas, only with some snow and toothless scrimers.Don't try to find any tribute to the original (kitty Claudette instead of 1974s cat Claude) and an attempt to strangle one of the villains with polyethylene. Instead, there's a bunch of blank college girls, one of whom, Riley (Imogen Poots), suffers from emotional trauma after being raped by one of the frat bros (Ryan McIntire), who escaped punishment and even dared to return to college. But the girls have worse problems: the tough student Chris (Aleyse Shannon) demands the dismissal of one of the old-school professor for his boomer-ish way of teaching. While Professor Gelson (Cary Elwes) is trolling the suffragists of the 21st century by quoting the well-known anti-feminist Camille Paglia, female students begin to disappear. And if nobody gave a crap about the horribly acting blonde girl from literally every BC trailer (Lucy Curry), the further disappearances begin to slowly alarm. The police shrugs and isn't eager to do anything (by the way, another curtsy to the original), so Riley begins her own investigation.Takal and Wolfe are as humble as a jackhammer when it's about the man which are either evil or stupid. An malicious cultist professor with his toxic bloodhound on a chain, annoying boyfriends who can either start a fight out of nothing or stutter while talking to a girl. The authors' ideas ends so quickly that they even use supernatural power, led by the late founder of the college - a white privileged slaver man of his 1800s, who was sure that women would occupy his stronghold of knowledge one day, and then the males must be able to defend... defend what? Oh, sorry, they never explain it anyway. They just hate women, that's all, bite it. No Billy, no Agnes, no real freedom from male opinion. Somewhere in 1974, Jess Bradford sighs heavily while firmly announcing to her boyfriend the decision to have an abortion. Turns out that women's rights aren't about freedom of choice, but about driving away the ""white men science"" from universities.Black Christmas doesn't want to be a horror movie. In fact, it doesn't want to be a film. But it wants to be an essay, which for whatever reason was wrapped in Christmas light. An essay, albeit with a budget of $ 5,000,000, is not capable of being exciting and thrilling. Even in others negative reviews, only Imogen Poots can be praised for the role of the emotionally injured, but strong by her spirit, but she is underestimated by the scriptwriters that did not want to give her character some decent development. Cary Elves wasn't told this isn't another ""Saw"", and therefore something like ""game over"" is about to burst from his terribly taut smile. The rest of the cast is a typical cannon fodder, as one of the characters (Lily Donoghue, who deserves more screen time tbh) behaves so cringy while interacting with the intruder as if she wanted to end all of this as soon as possible. It's also hilarious that there are two sorority houses, and the second one is shown briefly in the midst of their own attack. All for the sake of the final fight, so that there could me more female combat extras.The film is mostly praised for showing certain socially disturbing topics familiar to many... well, feminists. Campus abuse and rapes were described in the great ""The Hunting Ground"", and the pointless gory gender violence was shown in epic ""Assassination Nation"". What do we get in ""Black Christmas"" for millennials? The fear of walking down the street alone at night, the keys compressed in a shaking fist, and the unexplained progressive ladies' annoyance with the ""not all men"".Black Christmas is a boring, bloodless thriller that is radical in its beliefs and incapable of accepting a bit of a different opinion, shot for the fun of snowflakes and all kinds of warriors for the rights of all disenfranchised. Fortunately, this movie ceases to be associated with its predecessors as soon as it changes its name.",you messed with wrong slasher,no one was expecting remake black christmas nor was anyone asking it its sudden announcement june was like snow ones head what kind interest can there be cult proto slasher 1974 especially after notorious 2006s remake which many still either recall as nightmare or consider it comedy because its torture plot holes ridiculous killers background these two black christmases would remain typical tandem 80s original xxi century studio alteration but rights concept were bought by blumhouse with director sophia takal screenwriter april wolfe lead newest incarnation takal had previously shot some lazy indie thriller about mean female friendship full length episode anthology series into dark also about mean female friendship with new years entourage obviously everything starts there these two saw opportunity depict all their modern ideas only with some snow toothless scrimers dont try find any tribute original kitty claudette instead 1974s cat claude attempt strangle one villains with polyethylene instead theres bunch blank college girls one whom riley imogen poots suffers emotional trauma after being raped by one frat bros ryan mcintire who escaped punishment even dared return college but girls have worse problems tough student chris aleyse shannon demands dismissal one old school professor his boomer ish way teaching while professor gelson cary elwes is trolling suffragists 21st century by quoting well known anti feminist camille paglia female students begin disappear if nobody gave crap about horribly acting blonde girl literally every bc trailer lucy curry further disappearances begin slowly alarm police shrugs isnt eager do anything by way another curtsy original so riley begins her own investigation takal wolfe are as humble as jackhammer when its about man which are either evil or stupid malicious cultist professor with his toxic bloodhound chain annoying boyfriends who can either start fight out nothing or stutter while talking girl authors ideas ends so quickly that they even use supernatural power led by late founder college white privileged slaver man his 1800s who was sure that women would occupy his stronghold knowledge one day then males must be able defend defend what oh sorry they never explain it anyway they just hate women thats all bite it no billy no agnes no real freedom male opinion somewhere 1974 jess bradford sighs heavily while firmly announcing her boyfriend decision have abortion turns out that womens rights arent about freedom choice but about driving away white men science universities black christmas doesnt want be horror movie fact it doesnt want be film but it wants be essay which whatever reason was wrapped christmas light essay albeit with budget 5 000 000 is not capable being exciting thrilling even others negative reviews only imogen poots can be praised role emotionally injured but strong by her spirit but she is underestimated by scriptwriters that did not want give her character some decent development cary elves wasnt told this isnt another saw therefore something like game over is about burst his terribly taut smile rest cast is typical cannon fodder as one characters lily donoghue who deserves more screen time tbh behaves so cringy while interacting with intruder as if she wanted end all this as soon as possible its also hilarious that there are two sorority houses second one is shown briefly midst their own attack all sake final fight so that there could me more female combat extras film is mostly praised showing certain socially disturbing topics familiar many well feminists campus abuse rapes were described great hunting ground pointless gory gender violence was shown epic assassination nation what do we get black christmas millennials fear walking down street alone at night keys compressed shaking fist unexplained progressive ladies annoyance with not all men black christmas is boring bloodless thriller that is radical its beliefs incapable accepting bit different opinion shot fun snowflakes all kinds warriors rights all disenfranchised fortunately this movie ceases be associated with its predecessors as soon as it changes its name,0.5524441766709807,-0.02459238928311093,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.31}"

4,"Dull, awkward, and predictable.","The biggest offender of the latest incarnation of 'Black Christmas' is its lack of imagination. There's no mystique. There's no mystery. Considering its namesake, it doesn't even seem to attempt to try and retain any of the key components that makes the original film such a classic.For starters, the film is incredibly flat.

3,The story was so annoying and painfully slanted it took away from the movie,"Black Christmas (2019) is a movie I recently caught on HBOMAX and tells the tale of a group of sorority girls preparing to go home for Christmas when a serial killer starts plucking them off 1 by 1. Can the girls band together and stop the killer? This movie is directed by Sophia Takal (Green and Always Shine) and stars Imogen Poots (28 Days Later), Aleyse Shannon (Instinct), Lily Donoghue (Dr. Birds Advice for Sad Poets), Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride) and Zoe Robins (Power Rangers). The storyline for this picture had potential but focused too much on the agenda over the storyline. The film is all about girl power and girls working together rather than being a horror story as the primary focus. The ending had potential but misses the mark in its execution (the bleeding statue wasn't needed). There was a lot of areas I think this film could have been good as the kill scenes weren't awful, but the story was so annoying and painfully slanted it took away from the movie. I'd skip this and score it a 3.5/10.",story was so annoying painfully slanted it took away movie,black christmas 2019 is movie i recently caught hbomax tells tale group sorority girls preparing go home christmas when serial killer starts plucking them off 1 by 1 can girls band together stop killer this movie is directed by sophia takal green always shine stars imogen poots 28 days later aleyse shannon instinct lily donoghue dr birds advice sad poets cary elwes princess bride zoe robins power rangers storyline this picture had potential but focused too much agenda over storyline film is all about girl power girls working together rather than being horror story as primary focus ending had potential but misses mark its execution bleeding statue wasnt needed there was lot areas i think this film could have been good as kill scenes werent awful but story was so annoying painfully slanted it took away movie id skip this score it 3 5 10,0.658888888888889,-0.23777777777777775,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.17, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.19}"
1,hilariously amazingly terribly awful,"I honestly cannot believe how dumb this movie was. every time i thought it had reached its peak dumbness, it destroyed the previous barrier and reached new heights like something out of DBZ. my jaw dropped so many times. i had to pause the movie at one moment because i could not comprehend how dumb something was. i even spontaneously did that thing where you look around cause you are so dumbfounded, even though i watched it alone.my experience with this movie was so unique. i started off excited to watch a new movie, as usual. the opening scene was... decent. after about 15 minutes i realized it was garbage and was not enjoying it, so i started watching at 1.5 speed to get through the boring parts. then some stuff happened that i could not believe, and i started bursting out in laughter at a bunch of stuff. so i stopped watching at fast speed and started enjoying it as a hilariocity.then... it got worse. and worse. and dumber, and dumberer. omg moments. it got to the point where i was excited to see the new levels of dumbness it would reach. it plateaued for a while, but then exploded with dumbness in the climax. it was AMAZINGi feel like i can write an essay about this. but i'll try to keep it short. let's talk about the message. i've never seen a message of any kind that was as preachy and unashamedly in your face as this. just to be clear, i am a feminist. but i hate when movies are preachy. at first i was annoyed, but eventually i felt bad that a movie with this message does it so embarrassingly bad. have strong female characters that do smart awesome things, not terrible characters who just talk about your message.AND there were so many parts in this movie that seem very anti-feminist. like a scene where they dress up in sexy santa outfits and dance on stage for a bunch of frat guys. i get why they did it, still made me burst out in laughter at the backwardness of what i was watching.lets talk about the actual movie. scariness? ZERO. actually negative since i was laughing at most of the scenes intended to scare me. dialogue? trash. acting? awful except imogen poots. the story???

2,I feel like I owe James Wong and Glen Morgan an apology.,"Bob Clark's underrated 1974 masterpiece, Black Christmas, was a shining example of how to make a horror movie with a deep message attached to it. Sophia Takal's remake is a political message with a terrible horror movie attached to it.This is a film with the subtlety of a man being run over by a pink Greyhound bus. Characters in this film talk entirely in buzzwords and taglines, and if you make the mistake of going to see this then you better get used to it, because the filmmakers were far more concerned with getting their agenda across than making a horror movie. Large chunks of time pass where it feels like the film is far too focused on beating the audience over the head with its message that it forgets to be scary, and once it actually tries, it falls flat on its face. Of course, it doesn't help that this movie clearly got axed hard in the editing room to get a PG-13 rating, leaving very minimal onscreen bloodshed to make the final cut. The plot is also so wildly different from the original (a simple look at the trailer gives that away) that aside from a wink or two here and there, this really is just a remake in name alone. For that, the 2006 remake of Black Christmas at least deserves a touch of credit in retrospect for trying to show some respect for the source material. Sure, it's still a very flawed film in its own right, but at least it actually resembled a film.Imogen Poots and Cary Elwes are the only reasons why I'm even giving this a 2/10 instead of 1, because bless their hearts, they were trying.",i feel like i owe james wong glen morgan apology,bob clarks underrated 1974 masterpiece black christmas was shining example how make horror movie with deep message attached it sophia takals remake is political message with terrible horror movie attached it this is film with subtlety man being run over by pink greyhound bus characters this film talk entirely buzzwords taglines if you make mistake going see this then you better get used it because filmmakers were far more concerned with getting their agenda across than making horror movie large chunks time pass where it feels like film is far too focused beating audience over head with its message that it forgets be scary once it actually tries it falls flat its face course it doesnt help that this movie clearly got axed hard editing room get pg 13 rating leaving very minimal onscreen bloodshed make final cut plot is also so wildly different original simple look at trailer gives that away that aside wink or two here there this really is just remake name alone that 2006 remake black christmas at least deserves touch credit retrospect trying show some respect source material sure its still very flawed film its own right but at least it actually resembled film imogen poots cary elwes are only reasons why im even giving this 2 10 instead 1 because bless their hearts they were trying,0.5752252944188428,-0.008225806451612909,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.36}"
