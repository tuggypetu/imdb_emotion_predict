5,A perspective after all the hype has died down,"Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I've always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with ""The Phantom Menace"" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he's just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story's outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn't portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren't explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can't help being conscious of how he's manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin's portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn't appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he's special is that the plot requires it.If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what's happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet's inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.It's true that ""A New Hope"" never showed Alderaan's inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet's destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke's foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren't there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was ""Return of the Jedi,"" which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In ""The Phantom Menace,"" he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren't given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon's word for it when he describes Obi Wan as ""headstrong."" What's most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie's best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can't hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children's book that isn't very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a ""wow"" factor in the movie's visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the ""Star Wars"" movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they're not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy's continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today's standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they're almost universally acknowledged to be.",perspective after all hype has died down,lucas may have problems as director writer but ive always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability problem with phantom menace is that he simply has no story tell film merely adds introductory chapter story that has already been told stretches it out into two hour movie it is no accident that prequels this kind are rare they are very difficult make properly apparently hes just not sophisticated enough filmmaker pull it off one thing this project is limited by fact that anyone familiar with first trilogy knows storys outcome it therefore lacks some suspense associated with gradually unfolding saga more importantly however this situation leaves lucas with very little freedom as storyteller it also encourages him gloss over key events because their outcome is foregone conclusion he forgets bring them life example we know there will eventually be romance between anakin padme so lucas has two characters meet here surprise surprise they seem like each other their developing friendship isnt portrayed that clearly their motivations becoming close arent explained because lucas fails make scenes like these believable we cant help being conscious how hes manipulating plot his effort connect two trilogies another good example this problem is anakins portrayal as potential jedi there doesnt appear be anything about this kid remotely out ordinary even though other characters keep talking like there is our only reason thinking hes special is that plot requires it if story fails be engaging it is because we never see important events lucas makes fatal error not showing whats happening naboo small planet whose capture is focus plot numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against planets inhabitants but we only know about this because characters screen refer events usually rather woodenly deadpan performances are problem themselves but they only highlight our lack involvement story think han solo sweating fear then think emotional vacuums passing characters this film whenever any characters do express emotion as scene where anakin his mom part it still seems awfully restrained somehow lucas manages keep emotional reactions his characters minimum which gives film almost mechanical feel its true that new hope never showed alderaans inhabitants but we still could feel tragedy planets destruction through horrified reactions princess leia obi wan moreover there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly such as slaying rebels at beginning capture torture princess murder lukes foster parents furthermore major plot elements were intriguing themselves they werent there merely show us how they were be linked later events which seems be case with new film i suspect that lucas was not as concerned first trilogy with what had happen later story was therefore able focus his attention events at hand weakest segment was return jedi which had task bringing story end only then did lucas start show signs forcing plot points phantom menace he gets so bogged down task bringing his story point point b that he ends up with only bare bones plot none it comes alive this is especially true characterization old trilogy characters like yoda han reveal distinct personalities their first few minutes screen this film goes more than two hours characters including familiar ones come off vague nondescript we arent given much chance experience their personalities way they interact we must take qui gons word it when he describes obi wan as headstrong whats most odd is that cartoons seem better developed than humans scenes where qui gon negotiates with birdlike slave owner watto are amusing well done probably movies best scenes aside stunning action sequences but they cant hold candle constant interactions throughout first trilogy one thing i cannot do is accuse film lacking creativity design creatures technologies planets is impressive watching film is sort like reading childrens book that isnt very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations there is certainly wow factor movies visuals but effect it is short lived i get irked when i hear fans talk as though star wars movies were never about anything beyond special effects while inventive visuals are part what made originals so revolutionary theyre not what made films so fun watch no way can they explain trilogys continuing popularity today after all many original effects look primitive by todays standards their novelty has certainly worn off only enduring compelling storyline could have allowed first three films become classics theyre almost universally acknowledged be,0.5408710075720384,0.12918394177414796,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
7,"Visually a marvel to look at, disappointing in terms of story","Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is definitely worth a watch, but I do think it is one of the weaker movies of the Star Wars saga. I will admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative reviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some ways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and technical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special effects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The script is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The action is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray Park is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better. Most of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as Queen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who shone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most part, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams was outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound and direction are also impressive. However, there were things about this film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals, strong music score and good characters, the story never quite distinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did try to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further disadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his performances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do like Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars give unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even embarrassed. And as I said, the pacing is very uneven, there are some slow moments, and one or two scenes felt rushed. All in all, maybe disappointing for fans of the saga, but it cannot be denied that visually it is an accomplishment. 7/10 Bethany Cox",visually marvel look at disappointing terms story,star wars episode 1 phantom menace is definitely worth watch but i do think it is one weaker movies star wars saga i will admit i wasnt expecting much after reading some very negative reviews imdb but i do think this particular instalment did some ways exceed my expectations disappointed as well visual technical level it looks absolutely fantastic with splendid special effects stunning cinematography fine scenery costumes script is fairly decent perhaps lacking sophistication empire strikes back or new hope but does have some memorable lines action is constantly exhilarating darth maul well played by ray park is very good villain course though darth vader is better most performances are very good especially natalie portman as queen padma who looked stunning jake lloyd as anakin skywalker who shone with his confident charm jar jar binks is okay most part you have love yoda music score by john williams was outstanding definitely one his best works quality sound direction are also impressive however there were things about this film that did disappoint one is despite awesome visuals strong music score good characters story never quite distinguished itself it did take while get going when it did try get going you could tell it wanted it was further disadvantaged by uneven pacing liam neeson is fine actor his performances kinsey schindlers list are proof that i do like ewan mcgregor but as qui gon jin obi wan kenobi both stars give unusually wooden performances at times looked even embarrassed as i said pacing is very uneven there are some slow moments one or two scenes felt rushed all all maybe disappointing fans saga but it cannot be denied that visually it is accomplishment 7 10 bethany cox,0.5299498019710785,0.2605710601455283,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9,"The Beginning of the Star Wars Saga Introduces a Vivid New Universe and Celebrates the Innocent Fun of Star Wars, Despite Its Flaws","While it received generally positive reviews upon its release, and captured the imaginations of an entire generation of younglings, The Phantom Menace has garnered an almost toxic reputation on the internet in the years since. Sure, it's not a perfectly structured film, and yes, there are more than a few dopey decisions, but the sheer spectacle and sense of fun in Star Wars: Episode I cannot be denied. George Lucas' return to a galaxy far, far away is a triumph of creative vision. A movie that overcomes any and all of its narrative deficiencies through the pure drive of its creator to wow, thrill, and inspire.The Phantom Menace is chapter one of the Star Wars Saga, and it feels very much like the beginning of a larger story. It introduces all of the important players in the saga, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, The Jedi Council, and Anakin Skywalker, the tragic hero who we know will one day become the legendary Darth Vader. On a micro level, the plot revolves around an intergalactic trade war that leads to tensions between the Trade Federation and the inhabitants of the peaceful, Garden of Eden-like planet called Naboo. Jedis Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), are sent as peacekeepers to protect the planet's leader, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) from the evil Trade Federation and the ancient Sith Lord, Darth Maul, one of the most frightening and iconic characters ever to come out of the Star Wars universe. The Trade Federation plot does not have the same level of buoyant escapism as the originals', but it's not far off. The politics are kept at a minimum, and they only serve to create bad guys for our heroes to fight. The more important element of Episode I's story is the extended introduction of young Anakin Skywalker to this new Star Wars universe. The most interesting beats of the story center around Anakin and his mother, and The Jedi council's trepidation regarding the boy Qui-Gon suspects is the Chosen One. You get the sense that there is something special, yet sinister about the young podracing phenom from Tatooine. It's a great aspect of the film that largely goes unrecognized.None of the pieces of the plot really mean much for the prequel trilogy's overarching story of the downfall of Anakin Skywalker, but The actual conflict of Episode I is largely unimportant. At it's core, The Phantom Menace serves as a feature length introduction to George Lucas' new (old) Star Wars Universe. Episode I is the prologue to the Saga, telling a simple story that puts the pieces in place for later films while still standing on its own. On that level, it's kind of brilliant. Lucas takes a universe that was, as sweeping as it felt, still confined to a small collection of characters, and tears the lid off. The Phantom Menace does more to create a fictional history and detailed lore for the Star Wars universe than any other film. All of a sudden, this universe was no longer just a backdrop for the characters to play around in. It became a real place, with real politics, history, tradition, and age-old myths of its own. Remarkable if you ask me.Next to their storytelling, Star Wars movies have always been known for their special effects. With 16 years between movies, George Lucas' ILM team had the chance to perfect all of their award-winning visual effects, and perfect they did. Incorporating a litany of techniques from miniatures and animatronics to innovative use of CGI, The Phantom Menace is a breathtaking film to look at. Every single shot of The Phantom Menace is a work of art, and the sheer amount of imagination put into the world is worthy of praise. From the environments to the vehicles, the costumes, and the creatures, everything in this universe is unique, and ILM and company craft them with an unrivaled eye for detail. So strong is Lucas' vision of this world, that the plotting and dialogue are almost unnecessary. The visual storytelling of The Phantom Menace is that uncommonly strong.That expert craftsmanship extends to the action sequences. George Lucas' strengths as an editor and technician translate to more than a few show-stopping set-pieces. My favorite of which is young Anakin's bid for freedom, a kinetic and thrilling race across the vast deserts of Tatooine. The Podrace is a visually stunning and genuinely tense showcase of absolute speed. It still remains one of the most fun sequences in recent movie history. The same goes for the climactic three-way lightsaber duel at the end of the film. With brilliant visual effects, fast-paced and furious choreography, and a euphoric sense of scope, it brought something brand new to the Star Wars Universe, large-scale lightsaber duels. The battles, both in space and on land, stand out as old-fashioned, innocent fun. Despite a few silly moments, they tap into that Saturday matinee spectacle that resonates with the kid in us all.I love The Phantom Menace, despite its quirks. The script is clunky, especially in the first act where the plot seems to spin its wheels. There are slow moments and plenty of silly gags that fall flat. But my God, this movie is fun to watch! The visual splendor, the larger-than-life action set-pieces, the grand fun of the whole thing, The Phantom Menace is irresistible entertainment. An event movie with this kind of innocent charm is something unique in Hollywood, and that child-like earnestness is what makes this movie particularly endearing for me. The Phantom Menace might be different from the original trilogy in certain aesthetics, but importantly, not in feel. For the majority of this movie's runtime, it exudes the same brand of vibrant movie magic that made A New Hope a beloved classic. I won't call TPM a classic. I have my hangups with it, but I personally cannot bring myself to dislike this movie. Star Wars: Episode I works as an introduction to a brand new world, and as a stand-alone adventure that celebrates the innocent fun of the Original Star Wars.86/100",beginning star wars saga

I really quite liked it and the politics is easier to follow after a few viewings. I remember being quite shocked when I found out the 'queen' wasn't always who we thought.The sets and costumes are really beautiful.JarJar isn't really that bad, let's face it he's there to keep kids happy and that's OK isn't it? Obi-Wan is great, I really liked seeing him younger.I did feel quite sorry for Anakin this time around and I think the actor did quite well with the material he had.Yes this movie has it's issues, it can be slow at times and the bit about Midichlorians still makes me cringe but at least it's original and had a story to tell. It does remind me that Star Wars was really Anakin's story told in 6 parts.

But I think this one is a lot more better then episode 2 in many ways. And also I think Jar Jar Binks is a rather underrated character I know he can be annoying at times but he did play a large role in this film which fans are missing the point. The pod race is problay the best scene in this whole film as it was rather enjoyable to watch over and over again on youtube. Soundtrack is amazing and very well done for this movie.

4,Let's stop playing games - bad is bad,"The main line of defence seems to be: lighten up, it's just entertainment / just a kid's movie / just a special effects flick. Pausing awhile to note that people who run this line of defence have all but conceded that the film is, in fact, bad, let's take these points one by one - shall we?As entertainment it's poor. Dialogue is flat and perfunctory (don't expect to be dazzled by repartee); the story lacks the beauty of the first Star Wars film and the tension of the second ... and then there's the magical `character development' everyone complains about. We must distinguish character development from character delineation. The former is nice, but the latter is absolutely essential, and it's the latter that's missing from `The Phantom Menace'. Jar Jar, the young Obi Wan, Darth Maul, Armidala, Annakin - all are scarcely characters at all, and are very difficult to get enthused about. Jar Jar in particular is a collection of mannerisms, nothing more. This lack of character doesn't just prevent the film from becoming the darling of the intellectuals - it makes it dull. There are hundreds more entertaining films. Only those people who entered the cinema carrying plastic light sabers, grimly determined to enjoy themselves, failed to notice this.It's a kid's movie. Well, yes, in a sense - but not a good sense. Good children's movies form a proper subset of good movies - simply because adults have access to all childhood emotions and desires, but not vice versa. So in one sense a `kid's movie' is just a movie that can be understood and apperaciated by children (as well as adults). Is this a kid's movie in that sense? Maybe. But it's also a kid's movie in the bad sense: it's deeply witless, and inexperienced children might - I say, MIGHT - fail to notice just how witless it is. Children may - I say, MAY - ignore the fact that Jar Jar Binks is a deeply irritating non-character because he is all colour and movement and he speaks funny. Is this really all we want?Special effects. These aren't so hot, either. George Lucas has fallen in love with computers and failed to notice that his digital animals don't move at all in the way that real animals move - worse still, they don't move like any kind of physical object at all. Nor do most of the alleged physical objects. Compare the trundling white juggernaut at the start of `Star Wars' - a convincingly solid model - with the insubstantial collection of pixels that darts past us at the start of `The Phantom Menace'. The special effects have actually deteriorated, and to make matters worse, there are more of them.So the defence that `The Phantom Menace' is allowed to be a poor movie because it really wasn't trying to be something great in the first place, just won't wash. Especially so, given the ludicrous claims George Lucas has arrogantly made, again and again. So Jar Jar Binks is the first digitally created main character? Rubbish - the dragon in `Dragonheart' predates it (and, one might add, is at the very least a genuine character). So George Lucas is pioneering a new kind of filming-making, more like painting and less like photography, than the old? Absolute twaddle - Walt Disney did THAT in the 1930s. I'll tell you what IS new. Never before has there been so much sizzle, and so little sausage.",lets stop playing games bad is bad,main line defence seems be lighten up its just entertainment just kids movie just special effects flick pausing awhile note that people who run this line defence have all but conceded that film is fact bad lets take these points one by one shall we as entertainment its poor dialogue is flat perfunctory dont expect be dazzled by repartee story lacks beauty first star wars film tension second then theres magical character development everyone complains about we must distinguish character development character delineation former is nice but latter is absolutely essential its latter thats missing phantom menace jar jar young obi wan darth maul armidala annakin all are scarcely characters at all are very difficult get enthused about jar jar particular is collection mannerisms nothing more this lack character doesnt just prevent film becoming darling intellectuals it makes it dull there are hundreds more entertaining films only those people who entered cinema carrying plastic light sabers grimly determined enjoy themselves failed notice this its kids movie well yes sense but not good sense good childrens movies form proper subset good movies simply because adults have access all childhood emotions desires but not vice versa so one sense kids movie is just movie that can be understood apperaciated by children as well as adults is this kids movie that sense maybe but its also kids movie bad sense its deeply witless inexperienced children might i say might fail notice just how witless it is children may i say may ignore fact that jar jar binks is deeply irritating non character because he is all colour movement he speaks funny is this really all we want special effects these arent so hot either george lucas has fallen love with computers failed notice that his digital animals dont move at all way that real animals move worse still they dont move like any kind physical object at all nor do most alleged physical objects compare trundling white juggernaut at start star wars convincingly solid model with insubstantial collection pixels that darts past us at start phantom menace special effects have actually deteriorated make matters worse there are more them so defence that phantom menace is allowed be poor movie because it really wasnt trying be something great first place just wont wash especially so given ludicrous claims george lucas has arrogantly made again again so jar jar binks is first digitally created main character rubbish dragon dragonheart predates it one might add is at very least genuine character so george lucas is pioneering new kind filming making more like painting less like photography than old absolute twaddle walt disney did that 1930s ill tell you what is new never before has there been so much sizzle so little sausage,0.46721687777243354,0.03991756186200632,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,Leave Your Preconceptions Behind,"I know it's fashionable to scorn the ""prequel"" trilogy, but if one stands back a bit, things tend to snap into perspective. Compare ""Phantom Menace"" to most any other fantasy/sci-fi film, and it has to rate very high indeed.Plot: this is the more ""adult"" side of the Star Wars galaxy. The politics are remarkably credible, with the entire plot hinging on the result of a vote of no-confidence! How many adults even know what that is? (Hmm... maybe this explains the low ratings.) The relationships between the races on Naboo, the role of the Jedi... these things are established more clearly, and depicted more credibly than in any of the other five films.Technical achievement: Lucas paints on a vast digital canvas, and creates a world of wonders that have simply never been imagined by lesser talents. This is a living, breathing, believable world, that makes the world of the original trilogy seem cartoonish and contrived by comparison. Naboo, from the city, to the underwater kingdom, to the rolling green hills, is one of the great fantasy worlds, up there with those of the Thief of Baghdad (both versions), Blade Runner, or 2001. And our first glimpse of Coruscant has got to be one of the most memorable ""wow"" moments in the history of the movies.Characters: Liam Neeson's Qui Gon is one of the strongest characters in the Star Wars films, and Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan a worthy, more-dashing successor to the older version created by Alec Guinness. And Jar Jar Binks? Annoying? Not compared to the insipid C-3PO, or the insufferably perky R2-D2. Jar Jar is a fully formed character, with surprising depths. His manner is odd, perhaps abrasive, but he offers far more than the single note that Lucas used for his original comic-relief characters. And, of course, the fact that he is one of the first fully digital characters in film history has to be worth something. But Ian McDiarmid's Senator Palpatine is perhaps the most under-appreciated of all. This is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, a character who is both frighteningly real and perfectly ambiguous. McDiarmid balances his performance on a knife's edge, managing to be both fatherly and deeply unsettling.Yes, it may be that a certain human dimension is weaker here than in the original Star Wars. We don't have a clear ""hero"". There's no Luke, no Han. That's a valid point, but it is not inevitably a criticism. Qui Gon and Obi Wan aren't the comic-book heroes of A New Hope, but they are likable, heroic, and rich in characterization. If I had a choice between seeing 10 more episodes of the life of Han Solo or of Qui Gon Jinn, I'd choose the latter without hesitation.Story: The storyline in this film seems more real, more substantial than in the other five. We have the perfect sense of scale, from human drama to global (or interstellar) conflict. The one quibble might be the pod race. It's certainly entertaining, but does it go on too long? I think perhaps so. This is a structural weakness, but not a huge one. (Does Luke spend WAY too long on Dagobah, listening to warmed over Zen platitudes from that rubbery little jerk Yoda? Yes! Yet this is in the film most viewers seem to, unaccountably, pick as the ""best"" of the six. Clearly, there's some latitude for narrative digressions...)And then there's the climactic sword fight. I'd rate the three-way duel in Phantom Menace as the second-best sword fight in the Star Wars series, close after the finale of Return of the Jedi. The latter has a wonderful mythic quality, but this one is more visceral, more scary... partly because Darth Maul is such a cold, merciless villain, and partly because you know from the outset that the outcome is genuinely in doubt, that one of the Good Guys really could die. And the staging, using three master swordsmen, each with very different technique... This is just about as good as action film gets. Only two or three other movie duels come close: Rob Roy, again with Neeson, oddly enough; Scaramouche; Robin Hood... I can't think of a fourth. The closing duel ALONE should raise Phantom Menace into the front ranks of action and fantasy films.Bottom line: there is so much to enjoy in this film, so much to see, so much to feel, that it is amazing how anyone can possibly rate it below a 7 or 8. This is a scale of film making that few have ever attempted, let alone pulled off so beautifully. Perhaps that's the film's biggest fault: Lucas makes it all seem too easy.But, of course, we all know the REAL reason people can't give this film the 10 it richly deserves. That reason lies within themselves. Viewers in 1999 (let alone 2007) just couldn't feel as young, as innocent, as optimistic as they did when they saw the very first Star Wars. (Especially if they saw it way back in 1977, 30 years ago). Star Wars hasn't changed, George Lucas hasn't changed, nearly so much as the audience has changed. Alas. Moviegoers who are truly so jaded that they can't feel the passion and revel in the breadth of vision of The Phantom Menace have my sincerest sympathy. Yes, you can be ever so-o cool by putting down the prequel trilogy, but missing one of the best movies of all time is a very high price to pay.",leave your preconceptions behind,i know its fashionable scorn prequel trilogy but if one stands back bit things tend snap into perspective compare phantom menace most any other fantasy sci fi film it has rate very high indeed plot this is more adult side star wars galaxy politics are remarkably credible with entire plot hinging result vote no confidence how many adults even know what that is hmm maybe this explains low ratings relationships between races naboo role jedi these things are established more clearly depicted more credibly than any other five films technical achievement lucas paints vast digital canvas creates world wonders that have simply never been imagined by lesser talents this is living breathing believable world that makes world original trilogy seem cartoonish contrived by comparison naboo city underwater kingdom rolling green hills is one great fantasy worlds up there with those thief baghdad both versions blade runner or 2001 our first glimpse coruscant has got be one most memorable wow moments history movies characters liam neesons qui gon is one strongest characters star wars films ewan mcgregors obi wan worthy more dashing successor older version created by alec guinness jar jar binks annoying not compared insipid c 3po or insufferably perky r2 d2 jar jar is fully formed character with surprising depths his manner is odd perhaps abrasive but he offers far more than single note that lucas used his original comic relief characters course fact that he is one first fully digital characters film history has be worth something but ian mcdiarmids senator palpatine is perhaps most under appreciated all this is oscar worthy supporting performance character who is both frighteningly real perfectly ambiguous mcdiarmid balances his performance knifes edge managing be both fatherly deeply unsettling yes it may be that certain human dimension is weaker here than original star wars we dont have clear hero theres no luke no han thats valid point but it is not inevitably criticism qui gon obi wan arent comic book heroes new hope but they are likable heroic rich characterization if i had choice between seeing 10 more episodes life han solo or qui gon jinn id choose latter without hesitation story storyline this film seems more real more substantial than other five we have perfect sense scale human drama global or interstellar conflict one quibble might be pod race its certainly entertaining but does it go too long i think perhaps so this is structural weakness but not huge one does luke spend way too long dagobah listening warmed over zen platitudes that rubbery little jerk yoda yes yet this is film most viewers seem unaccountably pick as best six clearly theres some latitude narrative digressions then theres climactic sword fight id rate three way duel phantom menace as second best sword fight star wars series close after finale return jedi latter has wonderful mythic quality but this one is more visceral more scary partly because darth maul is such cold merciless villain partly because you know outset that outcome is genuinely doubt that one good guys really could die staging using three master swordsmen each with very different technique this is just about as good as action film gets only two or three other movie duels come close rob roy again with neeson oddly enough scaramouche robin hood i cant think fourth closing duel alone should raise phantom menace into front ranks action fantasy films bottom line there is so much enjoy this film so much see so much feel that it is amazing how anyone can possibly rate it below 7 or 8 this is scale film making that few have ever attempted let alone pulled off so beautifully perhaps thats films biggest fault lucas makes it all seem too easy but course we all know real reason people cant give this film 10 it richly deserves that reason lies within themselves viewers 1999 let alone 2007 just couldnt feel as young as innocent as optimistic as they did when they saw very first star wars especially if they saw it way back 1977 30 years ago star wars hasnt changed george lucas hasnt changed nearly so much as audience has changed alas moviegoers who are truly so jaded that they cant feel passion revel breadth vision phantom menace have my sincerest sympathy yes you can be ever so o cool by putting down prequel trilogy but missing one best movies all time is very high price pay,0.5017232370159199,0.19717207498914815,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.39}"

10,The path of one person: the pool of fear,"""Episode I: The Hidden Menace"" is perhaps the most ambiguous film in George W. Lucas's ""Star Wars"" series. Met by the rather coldly stern gaze of critics, the first film of the new trilogy can cause some confusion in the viewer. There are not many action scenes in it, there are many dialogues and just a leisurely development of actions, which sometimes may seem like a forced filler with a connecting function between fights and races. But this is only at first glance, because if you look closely ...Young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his teacher, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson), go to negotiations with the Trade Federation, which threatens to blockade the peaceful little planet of Naboo. In Obi-Wan's eyes, his mind and vision are already visible, his movements are already full of courage and confidence. Confidence and powerful, unquestioning dedication are seen in the young queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) that she is ready to do anything to help her people, the inhabitants of the occupied world federation. It is in ""The Phantom Menace"" most accurately and correctly disclose the nature and fragile at the same time in BOGATYRSKY solid Padme: it is able to stand alone against the decision of the Senate, venturing recklessly brave adventures and combine intuitive dictates of the heart with equanimity of mind.Qui-Gon Jin is unshakable and calm, in whatever situation he was. His eyes radiate wisdom and strength, a smile condescendingly reasonable, and the movements are smooth and weighed. But the main feature of Obi-Wan's teacher is not in these, of course, the most important qualities. Qui-Gon, first of all, is a man of exceptional faith. Some of his actions seem too risky and thoughtless, but somewhere in general they can be mistaken for a desperate bluff. But for him, extremely sensitive to everything around him, holding in an unsurpassed harmony the awareness of his own forces and the sense of difficulty of the tasks set, for him, who knows how to feel the situation on many, many forward steps, faith is the main tool. With her help, he stands unshakably on his feet, seeking his own, by all means.Once having set a goal - to certainly train quite a young Anakin Skywalker - Qui-Gon will go to her persistently and steadily. He alone believes in the Prophecy of the great destiny of the boy, as if he did not hear the fears of the Jedi Council that Anakin's uncertain future could pose great troubles to the Galaxy. But the foresight and the unique sense of Qui-Gon's world allow him to see far further than to his eminent like-minded people and mentors, like Master Yoda and Master Windu. In addition, an extraordinary faith allows Qui-Gon to destroy any of his fears and doubts that can obscure his clear eyes. The moment of the film is very important, in which the wise Jedi tells Anakin about the medichlorians, micro-organisms existing in symbiosis with the cells of any living organism. Perhaps, in these mysterious media chlorians lies the human soul, elusive to the eye and non-existent for touch. Then the wise counsel of Qui-Gon Jinn and unselfish greed deprived the boy Anakin Skywalker, wanted to visit every planet in the universe, it seems quite clear and sharp, Go up to the call of the heart, and you go on the right path. And even though this road is lost in the darkness of the gathering clouds, there will always be someone who sees a little farther than everyone else, and builds on this sagacity its most powerful faith. Qui-Gon believed in Anakin from the first second and believed in him to the end; most likely he understood the suffering and upheavals that promised further training of the boy for the Galaxy and for himself, but in one thing he was certain that in the final analysis Skywalker would return the Force to equilibrium ...Finishing on the major note of universal jubilation and festivities, ""Episode I: The Hidden Menace"" at first glance does not justify its mysterious and menacing title. But, having looked a little closer, we see that the holiday is just a calm before the storm, and a sweet truce is a tricky tactical ploy. It also becomes clear with horror that all the actions of all the heroes are quite comparable with the freedom to choose the actions of puppets tied to strong threads, for which someone is confidently pulling, able to control the movements of dolls by the easy fingering.And the violent protest of Padme Amidaly at the Senate meeting, and the murder of the mighty Darth Moule, and the fiasco of the Trade Federation, and the heroic death of Qui-Gon Gin, are all foggings in the plan of the mysterious strategist who is still hiding far from the battlefields, its galactic war. And Anakin Skywalker's aching lead heart, which is filled with a burning, drying fear after the death of a Jedi so much loved by him, also lies in a small coin, albeit of a larger value than the rest, on a comprehensive battle map of the devilish clever and cunning puppeteer. The beginning of the saga is laid, the heroes are represented, the plot knots are tied.

8,A very lacking addition to the Star Wars saga....,"For 6 months I longed to watch Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and for 133 minutes I was absolutely blown away with how well the movie was put together. I saw it on opening day of course, and I now understand why I have waited so long to write a review of it. If I had written this review right after I watched the movie, I would have written a review influenced by the months and months of anticipation. I feel now, after 17 months and countless 1000's of times watching all or some of the movie, I now feel that I can review this film free of influence.***Warning, this review is full of spoilers!***The Phantom Menace is a film that had virtually years between conception and completion and it's a horrible shame that they spent most of that time deciding whom to cast. On top of that, it now is clear to me that George Lucas spent much of the time filming this movie on certain parts, and not enough on others. For instance, the pod-racing scene is unbelievably awesome, and it is evident that Lucas spent a long period of time on this scene alone. The final battle between Qui-Gon Jin, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul is another prime example, I mean just to think up something like the long corridor with those strategically placed force fields must have took a lot of time and imagination. On the other hand, scenes like when Qui-Gon is explaining to Anikin what the `force' is should have been a little more elaborate, and in this case re-written and re-shot. Casting was, for the most part, well thought out. In the usual Star Wars' way, the main actors and actresses were not the usual $20 million dollar actors and actresses. In choosing Liam Neeson for the role of Qui-Gon Jin was anything but dull, and Ewan McGregor as the already introduced Obi-Wan Kenobi was even more brilliant. When choosing the eventual mother of Luke Skywalker (Queen Amidala), Natalie Portman was a unique choice. Even having the impressive Samuel L. Jackson in this movie was a great chance to see him along side Yoda. As I am pleased with all the previous choices, the most important of casting decisions in the past few years was not thought out well enough. Jake Lloyd was horribly miscast in the role of Anikin Skywalker. It almost hurt to listen to him present his lines.  From the first `Uh oh, this isn't good..' to the `I'm going to be a jedi knight?' his delivery is incredibly lacking of feeling. I would have to say that Jake Lloyd alone is a big part of why this movie will get a lower than usual rating from this viewer. As far as the villains in this movie, and there were many, Darth Maul must have sounded great on paper, but there must have been much lost in the translation onto the screen. He is neither terrifying, nor powerful like the eventual Darth Vader will be. Not until the final battle scene do we begin to somewhat fear him. Throughout the first three movies, we learned piece by piece about Darth Vader. We hated him since we first were introduced to him in Hope', and we grew to love him by the end of Jedi'. The problem with Menace' and Darth Maul, is that he wasn't introduced until at least 30 minutes into the film, and we never learned anything about him. The movie was indeed full of action, and I especially liked the use of CGI alongside the natural environments. The decision to include Jar Jar Binks, and fully computerized sidekick, was not necessarily a bad one, I just think that a few of his lines were a bit irrelevant to the story. I especially like Watto, and the scene with him and Qui-Gon Jin discussing payment for the part to Qui-Gon's ship.The use of wipe' transition from scene to scene is a classic Star Wars' piece. The lighting is also unique to the Star Wars' family of movies, as is the bland good vs. evil plot. If not for the pod racing scene (roughly reincarnated from Ben Hur), and the final three-way fight scene, Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace' would have earned a disappointingly low grade due to the lack of casting, and very obvious rush to get the movie completed.Please let this be known, this is the most expensive ($115 million) independent film ever created. It was fully funded by George Lucas himself. With this said, Episode I' is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, just an average sci-fi film that just happens to have the words Star Wars' in the title. After all this I must admit that I, once again, will probably be waiting for months to see the next film on opening day; let's just hope that we wont be let down again.",very lacking addition star wars saga,6 months i longed watch star wars episode i phantom menace 133 minutes i was absolutely blown away with how well movie was put together i saw it opening day course i now understand why i have waited so long write review it if i had written this review right after i watched movie i would have written review influenced by months months anticipation i feel now after 17 months countless 1000s times watching all or some movie i now feel that i can review this film free influence warning this review is full spoilers phantom menace is film that had virtually years between conception completion its horrible shame that they spent most that time deciding whom cast top that it now is clear me that george lucas spent much time filming this movie certain parts not enough others instance pod racing scene is unbelievably awesome it is evident that lucas spent long period time this scene alone final battle between qui gon jin obi wan kenobi darth maul is another prime example i mean just think up something like long corridor with those strategically placed force fields must have took lot time imagination other hand scenes like when qui gon is explaining anikin what force is should have been little more elaborate this case re written re shot casting was most part well thought out usual star wars way main actors actresses were not usual 20 million dollar actors actresses choosing liam neeson role qui gon jin was anything but dull ewan mcgregor as already introduced obi wan kenobi was even more brilliant when choosing eventual mother luke skywalker queen amidala natalie portman was unique choice even having impressive samuel l jackson this movie was great chance see him along side yoda as i am pleased with all previous choices most important casting decisions past few years was not thought out well enough jake lloyd was horribly miscast role anikin skywalker it almost hurt listen him present his lines first uh oh this isnt good im going be jedi knight his delivery is incredibly lacking feeling i would have say that jake lloyd alone is big part why this movie will get lower than usual rating this viewer as far as villains this movie there were many darth maul must have sounded great paper but there must have been much lost translation onto screen he is neither terrifying nor powerful like eventual darth vader will be not until final battle scene do we begin somewhat fear him throughout first three movies we learned piece by piece about darth vader we hated him since we first were introduced him hope we grew love him by end jedi problem with menace darth maul is that he wasnt introduced until at least 30 minutes into film we never learned anything about him movie was indeed full action i especially liked use cgi alongside natural environments decision include jar jar binks fully computerized sidekick was not necessarily bad one i just think that few his lines were bit irrelevant story i especially like watto scene with him qui gon jin discussing payment part qui gons ship use wipe transition scene scene is classic star wars piece lighting is also unique star wars family movies as is bland good vs evil plot if not pod racing scene roughly reincarnated ben hur final three way fight scene star wars episode i phantom menace would have earned disappointingly low grade due lack casting very obvious rush get movie completed please let this be known this is most expensive 115 million independent film ever created it was fully funded by george lucas himself with this said episode i is not bad film by any stretch imagination just average sci fi film that just happens have words star wars title after all this i must admit that i once again will probably be waiting months see next film opening day lets just hope that we wont be let down again,0.5419466490299824,0.1080864197530864,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10,One of the most underrated films in history,"I saw the Phantom Menace for the first time when I was 5 years old, and I remember being blown away by what I had watched. It was fantastic through the eyes of a child, something George was clearly trying to do. Now I am an adult, and watching it through the eyes of one, I can see all the mistakes, but that does not make the movie bad.For one, Star Wars has always been a series that has been aimed at children. Yes adults like it also, but Star Wars is not just popular for its films, but for its video games, toys and books. Most of which are for children. This film was great and it showed one of the best adventures of the 90s. When people complain about this film, their excuse is usually the same: too much CGI, poor acting and poor writing and poor direction.Yes the CGI is a bit dated, but it was really spectacular in some scenes. The acting was great in this film, as it was in the next two. The only actor who didn't give the best, was the young Jake Lloyd. It would be unfair to criticise the performance of someone who was a child at the time, of course he was not going to give a Al Pacino performance. The writing is OK, I guess, but really ask yourself this - what Star Wars film has good writing? None. They all have fantastic stories, which is why people love these films so much.George did a great job at expanding on his already loved saga. He gave us new worlds, new characters and showed us the Jedi Order, something we have been wanting to see for a long time. This film is a joyful adventure, with a great story.The character of Jar Jar is often another point of hate from 'older fans'. 'OLDER' fans. To a child, Jar Jar is a funny, clumsy stupid alien who acts insane, much like many Disney cartoon characters. I have a child of my own, and she thinks Jar Jar is hilarious, she is always pointing and laughing at him. THIS IS WHAT GEORGE WANTED! This film will always be criticised by people who just don't like it, or don't want to like it. But this is not a bad film. It starts of an adventure which would eventually lead to episode 6, and the future movies. Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace is a great film and a fantastic science-fiction movie.9.6/10",one most underrated films history,i saw phantom menace first time when i was 5 years old i remember being blown away by what i had watched it was fantastic through eyes child something george was clearly trying do now i am adult watching it through eyes one i can see all mistakes but that does not make movie bad one star wars has always been series that has been aimed at children yes adults like it also but star wars is not just popular its films but its video games toys books most which are children this film was great it showed one best adventures 90s when people complain about this film their excuse is usually same too much cgi poor acting poor writing poor direction yes cgi is bit dated but it was really spectacular some scenes acting was great this film as it was next two only actor who didnt give best was young jake lloyd it would be unfair criticise performance someone who was child at time course he was not going give al pacino performance writing is ok i guess but really ask yourself this what star wars film has good writing none they all have fantastic stories which is why people love these films so much george did great job at expanding his already loved saga he gave us new worlds new characters showed us jedi order something we have been wanting see long time this film is joyful adventure with great story character jar jar is often another point hate older fans older fans child jar jar is funny clumsy stupid alien who acts insane much like many disney cartoon characters i have child my own she thinks jar jar is hilarious she is always pointing laughing at him this is what george wanted this film will always be criticised by people who just dont like it or dont want like it but this is not bad film it starts adventure which would eventually lead episode 6 future movies star wars episode 1 phantom menace is great film fantastic science fiction movie 9 6 10,0.5504769921436586,0.1927048260381594,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.23, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"

The first time I saw it in the cinema I would had probably rated it a 7/10 but the second time I saw it in the cinema (yes, a real Star Wars fan doesn't watch a Star Wars movie just once in cinema :P), I already began to appreciate it more. It really is a movie that grows onto you. I'm now at the point were I'm loving this movie and see it as a great addition to the Star Wars saga. Granted that it's not the perfect beginning of the series but it certainly is a entertaining and beautiful movie. If this would had been the first Star Wars movie that had been made, I'm sure it would had been received way better than it did now. There are two things in this movie that make me consider this a great movie; The podrace and the duel of the fates. Those two parts in the movie make this is science-fiction classic. Yes, sure the podrace was totally inspired by the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race scene and therefor it's not the most original sequence in movie history but it has been made with lot's of profession and excellent special effect supported by the John Williams soundtrack. It should get your adrenaline really flowing. And even the biggest Star Wars hater has to admit that the duel of the fates is spectacular. It simply is the best lightsaber fight of all the Star Wars movies so far (Maybe the Obi-Wan/Anakin lightsaber fight is going to be even better?). It mainly is spectacular thanks to Ray Park as Darth Maul. His moves are incredible and something totally different than we were used to from the the other three firstly made Star Wars movies.Then why is ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" not a perfect movie? Well, there are several problems. One is the at times weak dialog. The other is of course the character Jar Jar Binks but maybe the biggest problem is Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker. He plays very inconsistent. In the one scene he is perfect and in the other he is just simply awful. Some words of comfort for Jake; he is not the worst actor in this movie. Ralph Brown is even more horrible as Ric Olié AKA Captain Obvious but also Pernilla August was pretty awful at times. Thankfully the rest of the cast is casted very well and there are some wonderful newly added characters. There have always been lot's of critic on the casting of the new Star Wars movies but I don't think that always has been completely fair. After all the movie has several Academy Award nominees (Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Terence Stamp) and it should get credit for casting Keira Knightley who hardly had been in any movies before appearing in this movie, in a fairly large role. Keira Knightley now is one of the biggest and fastest rising Hollywood stars of this decade. It also is great to see that some of the actors from the first made Star Wars movies are back to star in this movie (Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Ian McDiarmid). There also are some new great characters like Watto, Sebulba and the previously mentioned Darth Maul with his cool make-up and moves.The movie is very good non-stop entertainment in a good quick pace and come to think of it, it might very well the most entertaining Star Wars movie of them all. The special effects and make-up and costumes are top-class (even though Yoda looks horrible) and the icing on the cake is the musical score from John Williams. The movie is mainly fun and it has some spectacular moments. Also the lightsaber fight/droid battle/space fight ending will not disappoint you even though the space fight is the worst of all the Star Wars movies. But I think that says more about the other Star Wars movies than about this movie. Actually the fact that most people were disappointed with this movie says more about the other Star Wars movies than about this one, for this really is a great highly entertaining, nearly perfect movie for the entire family.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",wonderful but not perfect beginning greatest movie saga all time,star wars episode i phantom menace was probably one most anticipated movie last couple decades because whole hype around it it could only disappoint it was no surprise that lots people eventually were disappointed i have admit that even i was disappointed bit first time i saw it cinema i would had probably rated it 7 10 but second time i saw it cinema yes real star wars fan doesnt watch star wars movie just once cinema p i already began appreciate it more it really is movie that grows onto you im now at point were im loving this movie see it as great addition star wars saga granted that its not perfect beginning series but it certainly is entertaining beautiful movie if this would had been first star wars movie that had been made im sure it would had been received way better than it did now there are two things this movie that make me consider this great movie podrace duel fates those two parts movie make this is science fiction classic yes sure podrace was totally inspired by ben hur chariot race scene therefor its not most original sequence movie history but it has been made with lots profession excellent special effect supported by john williams soundtrack it should get your adrenaline really flowing even biggest star wars hater has admit that duel fates is spectacular it simply is best lightsaber fight all star wars movies so far maybe obi wan anakin lightsaber fight is going be even better it mainly is spectacular thanks ray park as darth maul his moves are incredible something totally different than we were used other three firstly made star wars movies then why is star wars episode i phantom menace not perfect movie well there are several problems one is at times weak dialog other is course character jar jar binks but maybe biggest problem is jake lloyd as young anakin skywalker he plays very inconsistent one scene he is perfect other he is just simply awful some words comfort jake he is not worst actor this movie ralph brown is even more horrible as ric oli aka captain obvious but also pernilla august was pretty awful at times thankfully rest cast is casted very well there are some wonderful newly added characters there have always been lots critic casting new star wars movies but i dont think that always has been completely fair after all movie has several academy award nominees samuel l jackson natalie portman liam neeson terence stamp it should get credit casting keira knightley who hardly had been any movies before appearing this movie fairly large role keira knightley now is one biggest fastest rising hollywood stars this decade it also is great see that some actors first made star wars movies are back star this movie frank oz anthony daniels kenny baker ian mcdiarmid there also are some new great characters like watto sebulba previously mentioned darth maul with his cool make up moves movie is very good non stop entertainment good quick pace come think it it might very well most entertaining star wars movie them all special effects make up costumes are top class even though yoda looks horrible icing cake is musical score john williams movie is mainly fun it has some spectacular moments also lightsaber fight droid battle space fight ending will not disappoint you even though space fight is worst all star wars movies but i think that says more about other star wars movies than about this movie actually fact that most people were disappointed with this movie says more about other star wars movies than about this one this really is great highly entertaining nearly perfect movie entire family 9 10,0.5900296115921115,0.2157742604617605,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.37, 'Fear': 0.22}"
7,Disappointing,"Although it looks amazing I found The Phantom Menace to be hugely disappointing, the story was poor and it just didn't feel like a Star Wars film. The best part by far was an amazing battle between Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. The worst by far was Jar Jar Binks, an awful, annoying, totally unfunny character. Ewen MacGregor was good as Obi Wan Kenobi but wasn't given much to do, Liam Neeson was very good also as was the child actor who played Anakin Skywalker. Natalie Portman wasn't so great though, showing little of the promise she showed in Leon. It was great to see R2D2 and C3PO again though and as you would expect the special effects were amazing including an astounding pod race sequence. Yoda was back too alongside Samuel L Jackson playing the part of a Jedi. I pray Episode II is better than this ***7/10*",disappointing,although it looks amazing i found phantom menace be hugely disappointing story was poor it just didnt feel like star wars film best part by far was amazing battle between obi wan kenobi darth maul worst by far was jar jar binks awful annoying totally unfunny character ewen macgregor was good as obi wan kenobi but wasnt given much do liam neeson was very good also as was child actor who played anakin skywalker natalie portman wasnt so great though showing little promise she showed leon it was great see r2d2 c3po again though as you would expect special effects were amazing including astounding pod race sequence yoda was back too alongside samuel l jackson playing part jedi i pray episode ii is better than this 7 10,0.6640571428571428,0.11518571428571428,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.3}"
7,Greed can be a very powerful ally.,"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is written, produced and directed by George Lucas and stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Ian McDiarmid. The fourth film released in the Star Wars franchise, it is, however, the first of three prequels that lead up to Star Wars that was released in 1977. Plot basically follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) and his apprentice padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), who escort and protect Queen Amidala (Portman) from Naboo to Coruscant in the hope of finding peace as an interplanetary trade dispute starts to boil over. During the journey the party stops over at Tatooine and encounter a young boy named Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi feel the force is strong with young Skywalker and enlist him into the group with the intention of training him to become a Jedi Knight. Meanwhile, as hostilities escalate in the galaxy, the mysterious Sith is moving into the equation.The most anticipated movie of all time arrived in 1999, hyped into the stratosphere, the fanfare and bunting stretched from Hollywood to the far corners of the cinema loving world. Perhaps unsurprisingly? The Phantom Menace failed to meet the expectation of Star Wars fans and critics alike. That the film in box office receipts alone made almost $930 million, has, tended to be forgotten. But that's not to say the film deserved such rich financial rewards, because all told it didn't. It's not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a fun movie experience, and in retrospect it can be said that Lucas and co learnt from the film to make the next two film's in the series better. Mistakes were made, for sure, but for action and intrigue the film scores points well enough.On a personal note, I was one of the fans who came out of the cinema after watching it the first time and hated it. So whilst I wasn't one of the ""fans"" who at the time accused Lucas of ruining childhood memories, I was suitably annoyed to stay away from the film for over ten years. After the prequel trilogy had run its course, I was often asked by some film loving friends to give ""Menace"" another go. Their argument was that free of hype and expectation, ""Menace"" can really be enjoyed as a sort of popcorn and beer sci-fi blockbuster. And they were right. Watching it sparkle in HD and disassociating it with those golden memories of 77, 80 and 83, it has much to enjoy. Sure the old problems still exist, dodgy acting (why is McGregor playing it so fey?), Binks (aargh), fart gags (really Mr. Lucas? Really?), close to the knuckle racial stereotyping and the absence of a Hans Solo type to stir the blood of both sexes. While of course the writing is borderline tepid, full of a need to explain things and prove itself as a reason to exist. So yes, full of flaws (many others exist for different people of course), but the whizz bangery of the action and set pieces keep it, to my mind, far away from stinker status.The pod race, a souped up extension to Return of the Jedi's speed-biker pursuits, is one of the series' highlights, as is the showdown between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul (Ray Park), a superbly cool villain with an even cooler double ended light sabre. The latter of which is excellently scored by John Williams and features top notch choreography. The battles widen the eyes and the ears, notably the Droid army versus the Gungan's, and there's a whole host of new creatures and aliens to get acquainted with (check out those underwater beasties). The charge of CGI overkill is a fair one, and this issue is a more prominent problem in standard HD, never mind the Blu-ray, as the non human characters look too obviously CGI next to the human's. Which is just another reason to pick apart what's wrong with the Phantom Menace. But why do that? Sit back, relax, munch some snacks and sip that beer, it's not that bad a movie experience.

8,"16 years later, and we finally get to see the beginning of the Saga","The problems George Lucas had, when he began to piece together the prequel trilogy to the Epic Star Wars Saga are as follows - 1/ He's tied into a story that all the original fans already know, leaving him less scope for his ideas than he had before.2/ He made such a fine job of the original movies, the fans will expect more of the same.3/ He has to appeal to a new generation of Star Wars fans, and without the Impact of Groundbreaking special effects, its harder this time round. (Face it, Great special effects are seen in adverts these days)So, evidently we end up with an inferior movie, but thankfully it's still a good one. Lucas has still managed to bring in some new characters, he has created some memorable scenes (the Pod Race scene is superb) and above all he's begun to fill in some background to the characters we Star Wars fans know and love, R2, C3PO, Obi-Wan and Yoda. I believe more time could have spent on some of the new characters build up, but he only has 3 films to reach the point where Star Wars started off, and there is a lot of story to cover.There are some flaws in the film, but there is enough here to entertain you, and George is just warming up.One thing i was massively impressed with, and strangely it was the movies biggest let down at the same time, Darth Maul and his truly brilliant light-sabre battle with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon.

8,An Immensely Enjoyable Film,"When I went to see The Phantom Menace, I was almost uncontrollably excited. I loved the original Star Wars trilogy, and was hugely anticipating the new trilogy. To my immense delight, I thought that The Phantom Menace was a brilliant film.In some respects, I can see why people dislike The Phantom Menace. Yes, there are some wooden performances (eyes on you, Natalie Portman). Yes, the dialogue is clunky. But I don't really think that Oscar-worthy performances and exceptional writing are what the Star Wars saga is about. In my opinion, it is more about grand and epic storytelling, which this film accomplishes extremely well.The visuals are the film's best asset. George Lucas creates brand new worlds for us to gasp in awe at, with such detail and creativity put into creating the environments that it is hard to believe that you can't reach out and feel them. The crew deserve tremendous applause for such an incredibly creative accomplishment. Each world has its own individual character. Whereas Coruscant is a sprawling, busy capital, Tatooine is unfriendly and barren. The visual effects are terrific, and you find yourself indulging on almost every detail.However, it wouldn't be a great Star Wars movie without action, and Phantom Menace delivers two scorching set pieces. The first is a frenetically furious pod race, in which the racers shoot through dangerous terrain, all the time trying to avoid dirty tricks from their competitors and unfriendly fire from unhappy campers. The race is brilliantly gripping, keeping you on the edge of your seat from the heart-stopping beginning to the cheer-worthy ending. As with almost every scene in the movie, the race is also jam-packed with clever details, drawing you in closer to the action.The second is a pulse-raising three-way lightsaber fight between Qui-Gon Jinn (the excellent Liam Neeson), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Darth Maul (athlete Ray Park). This lightsaber duel conquers all of the previous duels in the series, and is absolutely terrific. It is fantastically exciting to finally see such a fast-paced, brutal and energetic lightsaber fight, where the combatants seem perfectly fluent and are fighting with every ounce of their strength. This sequence is a classic sword fight, which will always be in my mind when anyone mentions Star Wars.In addition to the fantastic action, there is another phenomenal score from John Williams. He provides several breath-taking new tunes (the highlight is Duel of The Fates, which is played during the lightsaber fight), yet also offers foreshadowing of future events in the saga by using tunes from the original films. Despite the fact that the performers are hindered by undoubtedly clunky dialogue, quite a few of them manage to turn in decent performances. Neeson gives a noble and powerful performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, fully emphasising the perfect image of a Jedi master. Ewan McGregor provides a few moments of brilliant emotional clarity, whilst Jake Lloyd gives a passable portrayal of future Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker. But the best performance comes from Pernilla August, who gives a performance of great grace and vulnerability as Anakin's mother.George Lucas handles all of the proceedings with consummate skill. He has made some mistakes in the screenplay, but he has ensured to the best of his ability that he is able to grant us a compelling and engaging vision of the Star Wars galaxy. He has had some low points in his career, but on a creative scale, this certainly isn't one of them. He directs the film passionately and without remorse, which earns him my deepest respect.This is a brilliant fantasy movie. It may not be as dark as the fans were hoping for, but it is still successful in terms of its creativity, its visual effects and its action.",immensely enjoyable film,when i went see phantom menace i was almost uncontrollably excited i loved original star wars trilogy was hugely anticipating new trilogy my immense delight i thought that phantom menace was brilliant film some respects i can see why people dislike phantom menace yes there are some wooden performances eyes you natalie portman yes dialogue is clunky but i dont really think that oscar worthy performances exceptional writing are what star wars saga is about my opinion it is more about grand epic storytelling which this film accomplishes extremely well visuals are films best asset george lucas creates brand new worlds us gasp awe at with such detail creativity put into creating environments that it is hard believe that you cant reach out feel them crew deserve tremendous applause such incredibly creative accomplishment each world has its own individual character whereas coruscant is sprawling busy capital tatooine is unfriendly barren visual effects are terrific you find yourself indulging almost every detail however it wouldnt be great star wars movie without action phantom menace delivers two scorching set pieces first is frenetically furious pod race which racers shoot through dangerous terrain all time trying avoid dirty tricks their competitors unfriendly fire unhappy campers race is brilliantly gripping keeping you edge your seat heart stopping beginning cheer worthy ending as with almost every scene movie race is also jam packed with clever details drawing you closer action second is pulse raising three way lightsaber fight between qui gon jinn excellent liam neeson obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor darth maul athlete ray park this lightsaber duel conquers all previous duels series is absolutely terrific it is fantastically exciting finally see such fast paced brutal energetic lightsaber fight where combatants seem perfectly fluent are fighting with every ounce their strength this sequence is classic sword fight which will always be my mind when anyone mentions star wars addition fantastic action there is another phenomenal score john williams he provides several breath taking new tunes highlight is duel fates which is played during lightsaber fight yet also offers foreshadowing future events saga by using tunes original films despite fact that performers are hindered by undoubtedly clunky dialogue quite few them manage turn decent performances neeson gives noble powerful performance as qui gon jinn fully emphasising perfect image jedi master ewan mcgregor provides few moments brilliant emotional clarity whilst jake lloyd gives passable portrayal future darth vader anakin skywalker but best performance comes pernilla august who gives performance great grace vulnerability as anakins mother george lucas handles all proceedings with consummate skill he has made some mistakes screenplay but he has ensured best his ability that he is able grant us compelling engaging vision star wars galaxy he has had some low points his career but creative scale this certainly isnt one them he directs film passionately without remorse which earns him my deepest respect this is brilliant fantasy movie it may not be as dark as fans were hoping but it is still successful terms its creativity its visual effects its action,0.5984517443340972,0.25302011713776423,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.25, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10,Star Wars: An Incredible Beginning,"When I was a small kid, I used to wonder what the Star Wars universe was all about. Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi Knights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I watched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George Lucas, the creator of the popular sci-fi saga itself, was trying to accomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And now, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his entire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws. The evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet of Naboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch the two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation Battleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for our heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight face-to-face with thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the annoying yet kind-hearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful Queen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her make-up). Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is believed to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a cool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match until his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a Naboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!). You need to see the rest of the film if you haven't watched one yet. Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I especially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the wondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To heighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during the climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The Phantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak (gee, I wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters aren't well developed. Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will be a major improvement by the time Episode II is released.",star wars incredible beginning,when i was small kid i used wonder what star wars universe was all about imperial soldiers droids flying spaceships starfighters jedi knights darth vader etc i was curious with all these stuff but when i watched all three star wars movies i began understand what george lucas creator popular sci fi saga itself was trying accomplish explore awe wonders our ever expanding universe now 22 years after release first movie george lucas his entire crew at lucasfilm bring most anticipated movie 1999 star wars episode i phantom menace i am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws evil trade federation has stopped all shipping peaceful planet naboo resolve that matter galactic republic decides dispatch two jedi knights obi wan kenobi qui gon jinn trade federation battleship arrange negotiation with neimodians unfortunately our heroes negotiation never takes place so they fight face face with thousands battle droids escape naboo there they meet annoying yet kind hearted gungan jar jar binks as well as beautiful queen amidala ok i know some you out there complaint about her make up later our heroes meet anakin skywalker mysterious boy who is believed bring balance force my opinion anakin is such cool person because he is great podracer who never wins single match until his recent confrontation with rival sebulba he is going fly naboo starfighter too during battle naboo bravo jake lloyd you need see rest film if you havent watched one yet episode i phantom menace is very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known star wars universe i especially like locations some planets naboo palace wondrous city coruscant as well as its awesome special effects heighten up action darth maul makes incredible performance during climatic battle with jedi knights however i never say that phantom menace is 100 perfect movie storyline is pretty weak gee i wonder what george lucas is thinking some characters arent well developed still this is just only beginning perhaps there will be major improvement by time episode ii is released,0.6587261904761905,0.2255803571428571,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.26}"
8,It begins...,"The Phantom Menace is one of those movies that I have been meaning to review since I first saw it on opening day years and years ago. I have a little book where I make notes of movies I would like to review, and when I flipped back to the page for Episode I, I noticed that the last time I jotted down a couple of points about this movie was December 26, 2002. Odd coincidence that I should be four years later to the day that I finally sit down to review it. The first thing that really struck me after seeing it for the first time was a huge sense of surprise at how much it did not live up to my expectations. I'm hardly a Star Wars fanatic, I don't even know many character names beyond the primary three or four, but I know the three original films and I understand how brilliant they are. I think that what went wrong was a combination of almost unprecedented expectation, too much CGI capability, and too much money. Lucas, who loathed studios in his earlier days as a filmmaker, now laments the fact that he has nearly become a studio himself. He funded Episode I out of his own pocket, and I think that now that he has the ability to really do anything he wants (since he has unlimited funding and it's all his own anyway, so he makes all of the rules with virtually no limitations), we get for the first time a really look at his strengths and weaknesses. I'm not going to go into the weaknesses too much because there are far more strengths than weaknesses, and I suppose I should point out at this point that The Phantom Menace is a very strong Star Wars movie, it's just not what it could have and should have been. It will take audiences time to accept additions like a digital Yoda, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jar Jar Binks to such a well known saga as the Star Wars films, and I think that things like that can account for some of the bad reactions that the movie received. On the other hand, the film really emphasizes how powerful Lucas' visual imagination is, which could also be seen in the first three films. His ability to dream up imaginary worlds and creatures and societies is as astonishing as it ever has been, and the general, overall badassedness (and the names!) of characters like Qui Gon Jin and Darth Maul is astonishing. The battle between Obi Wan, Qui Gon Jin, and Darth Maul I think is one of the best fight scenes in the entire series up to this point. Consider the way that Qui Gon, when they are fighting through that hallway where they're separated periodically by force fields, kneels and meditates when they're separated, while Darth Maul paces back and forth like a caged tiger. And of course the pod-racing scene was phenomenal!And the look of the film is beautiful from beginning to end. Indeed, during the slow parts, if you find yourself drifting away from the complexities of the plot being unfolded through diplomatic dialogue a little too thick to handle, you can entertain yourself just by gazing at the stunning surroundings. Jake Lloyd handles his role well for someone so young, as does the initially questionably cast Natalie Portman, who seems far too cute for the role but pulls it off brilliantly. Liam Neeson steals every scene he is in (and seems to belong in the film more than anyone else), but the casting seems to be all pretty much right on the mark. It's really unfortunate about Jar Jar though, he's just not a clever character. This is the first film that George Lucas has directed in more than 20 years (since the original Star Wars film), and it's clear that he is getting the feel of it all back in this movie. As brilliant as he is, directing is not his strong point, but as we saw from Episodes II and III, in The Phantom Menace he was just getting warmed up.",it begins,phantom menace is one those movies that i have been meaning review since i first saw it opening day years years ago i have little book where i make notes movies i would like review when i flipped back page episode i i noticed that last time i jotted down couple points about this movie was december 26 2002 odd coincidence that i should be four years later day that i finally sit down review it first thing that really struck me after seeing it first time was huge sense surprise at how much it did not live up my expectations im hardly star wars fanatic i dont even know many character names beyond primary three or four but i know three original films i understand how brilliant they are i think that what went wrong was combination almost unprecedented expectation too much cgi capability too much money lucas who loathed studios his earlier days as filmmaker now laments fact that he has nearly become studio himself he funded episode i out his own pocket i think that now that he has ability really do anything he wants since he has unlimited funding its all his own anyway so he makes all rules with virtually no limitations we get first time really look at his strengths weaknesses im not going go into weaknesses too much because there are far more strengths than weaknesses i suppose i should point out at this point that phantom menace is very strong star wars movie its just not what it could have should have been it will take audiences time accept additions like digital yoda samuel l jackson jar jar binks such well known saga as star wars films i think that things like that can account some bad reactions that movie received other hand film really emphasizes how powerful lucas visual imagination is which could also be seen first three films his ability dream up imaginary worlds creatures societies is as astonishing as it ever has been general overall badassedness names characters like qui gon jin darth maul is astonishing battle between obi wan qui gon jin darth maul i think is one best fight scenes entire series up this point consider way that qui gon when they are fighting through that hallway where theyre separated periodically by force fields kneels meditates when theyre separated while darth maul paces back forth like caged tiger course pod racing scene was phenomenal look film is beautiful beginning end indeed during slow parts if you find yourself drifting away complexities plot being unfolded through diplomatic dialogue little too thick handle you can entertain yourself just by gazing at stunning surroundings jake lloyd handles his role well someone so young as does initially questionably cast natalie portman who seems far too cute role but pulls it off brilliantly liam neeson steals every scene he is seems belong film more than anyone else but casting seems be all pretty much right mark its really unfortunate about jar jar though hes just not clever character this is first film that george lucas has directed more than 20 years since original star wars film its clear that he is getting feel it all back this movie as brilliant as he is directing is not his strong point but as we saw episodes ii iii phantom menace he was just getting warmed up,0.5311424394319131,0.17580817574238625,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"
8,"Not as bad as first thought, but oh dear - why Jar Jar?","In light of the completion of the Star Wars saga with Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is probably due for a re-evaluation. While by no means anywhere near as good as the original trilogy, neither is it really that bad a film. After all, it's still Star Wars! The one overwhelming criticism of Episode I is the presence of one Jar Jar Binks. A computer generated amphibian with possibly the most irritating and child-like character and almost unintelligible voice in the history of cinema, with the possible exception of Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod in 'The Fifth Element'. Jar Jar is merely a walking talking marketing device aimed squarely at children. It is he who is the main cause of irritation for the die-hard fans. But also the lack of action, and the slightly over-long podrace also drew complaints, which reeked of a set-up or plug for a computer game (which of course appeared at the time of the film's release). Further, the plot was rather heavy on talking and politic scenes, causing the plot to slightly drag, and Lucas's over-reliance on computer generated scenery at times prove slightly nauseating for the viewer.However there is much to recommend the film and to appease the critics (although they remain mostly over-looked in order to criticise the film more effectively). Whilst it does feel like a commercial, the pod race is still an adrenaline-fuelled and exciting race scene. The lightsaber battle scenes are outstanding, in particular the final scene where Darth Maul fights both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan with a double-ended lightsaber. Indeed, some have called this lightsaber duel the best of all six films. The choral music which accompanies this battle, Duel of the Fates, is possibly the most iconic piece of film music since Indiana Jones or even the original Star Wars films themselves. And baddie Darth Maul himself is also probably the coolest-looking movie villain since Darth Vader.Also, as a beginning to the prequels for the Star Wars original trilogy, there are a few lovely teases of what is to come to tie the series together  including one for the fanatics with an appearance of a young Greedo. The plot adequately covers Anakin's origin story, but there are possibly not quite enough seeds sown for Anakin's future fall from grace, and in Episode II the transformation thus seems far too steep. However, re-watching the film after seeing the following two prequels does shed more light on character motivations and the like. In particular, in light of Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine's machinations and manipulations in Episode I have become even more obvious and intriguing. There is also a brief but pointed first meeting of Palpatine and Anakin at the film's conclusion.Leaving aside the irritant Jar Jar Binks, the acting is largely very good. Liam Neeson is serene and regal as Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn, and Natalie Portman does a terrific job in the dual role of Queen Amidala and the handmaiden Padmé (though the former is shared to some extent with Keira Knightley). Ewan McGregor, while competent as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, does not really make the role his own, and seems unsure of his identity within the role. Instead he tries to mimic a young Alec Guinness, but this unfortunately makes his performance rather weak. Ray Park, while having little to do acting-wise, is superb in the fight scenes, and is instrumental in making the film's climactic lightsaber duel one of the best of the entire franchise.Overall the film is nowhere near as bad as many fans claim it to be. However it is still probably by far the weakest of the six films, and as an introduction to Star Wars for new fans they would be far better served by watching the original 1977 classic. But the fault lies primarily in the character Jar Jar Binks. While the overlong pod race feels like a commercial for the video game it is still visually impressive throughout, and the lightsaber battle is certainly worthy of the first Star Wars film in over 15 years. And with George Lucas directing, the magical feel of Star Wars is certainly present in the fights and space battles, and the story is a good and involving one, if maybe slightly over-elaborate, but this is perhaps needed in order to begin to tie all the films together. Fans will also enjoy spotting potential links to the original trilogy and cameos from future characters, including Greedo and Jabba the Hutt (and the Mos Eisley Cantina Band on the DVD deleted scenes). Unfortunately, as stated before, the film drastically suffers from the suffocating presence of the hideous aforementioned Gungan monopolising far too much screen time. Had Jar Jar been killed off early, the film may have gained a 9, but instead the film barely scrapes an 8  which is not good enough for Star Wars.",not as bad as first thought but oh dear why jar jar,light completion star wars saga with revenge sith star wars episode i phantom menace is probably due re evaluation while by no means anywhere near as good as original trilogy neither is it really that bad film after all its still star wars one overwhelming criticism episode i is presence one jar jar binks computer generated amphibian with possibly most irritating child like character almost unintelligible voice history cinema with possible exception chris tuckers ruby rhod fifth element jar jar is merely walking talking marketing device aimed squarely at children it is he who is main cause irritation die hard fans but also lack action slightly over long podrace also drew complaints which reeked set up or plug computer game which course appeared at time films release further plot was rather heavy talking politic scenes causing plot slightly drag lucass over reliance computer generated scenery at times prove slightly nauseating viewer however there is much recommend film appease critics although they remain mostly over looked order criticise film more effectively whilst it does feel like commercial pod race is still adrenaline fuelled exciting race scene lightsaber battle scenes are outstanding particular final scene where darth maul fights both qui gon obi wan with double ended lightsaber indeed some have called this lightsaber duel best all six films choral music which accompanies this battle duel fates is possibly most iconic piece film music since indiana jones or even original star wars films themselves baddie darth maul himself is also probably coolest looking movie villain since darth vader also as beginning prequels star wars original trilogy there are few lovely teases what is come tie series together including one fanatics with appearance young greedo plot adequately covers anakins origin story but there are possibly not quite enough seeds sown anakins future fall grace episode ii transformation thus seems far too steep however re watching film after seeing following two prequels does shed more light character motivations like particular light revenge sith palpatines machinations manipulations episode i have become even more obvious intriguing there is also brief but pointed first meeting palpatine anakin at films conclusion leaving aside irritant jar jar binks acting is largely very good liam neeson is serene regal as jedi master qui gon jinn natalie portman does terrific job dual role queen amidala handmaiden padm though former is shared some extent with keira knightley ewan mcgregor while competent as young obi wan kenobi does not really make role his own seems unsure his identity within role instead he tries mimic young alec guinness but this unfortunately makes his performance rather weak ray park while having little do acting wise is superb fight scenes is instrumental making films climactic lightsaber duel one best entire franchise overall film is nowhere near as bad as many fans claim it be however it is still probably by far weakest six films as introduction star wars new fans they would be far better served by watching original 1977 classic but fault lies primarily character jar jar binks while overlong pod race feels like commercial video game it is still visually impressive throughout lightsaber battle is certainly worthy first star wars film over 15 years with george lucas directing magical feel star wars is certainly present fights space battles story is good involving one if maybe slightly over elaborate but this is perhaps needed order begin tie all films together fans will also enjoy spotting potential links original trilogy cameos future characters including greedo jabba hutt mos eisley cantina band dvd deleted scenes unfortunately as stated before film drastically suffers suffocating presence hideous aforementioned gungan monopolising far too much screen time had jar jar been killed off early film may have gained 9 but instead film barely scrapes 8 which is not good enough star wars,0.5035136765888977,0.1334117725931885,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.42}"
9,Ignore the Whiners -- The Phantom Menace is Brilliant!,"WARNING: CONTAINS A SPOILER WHICH EXPLAINS THE TITLE!Having read some of the reviews posted here before seeing this movie, I was pleasantly surprised!Why are there are so many gripers? I think it's because:1) ""Star Wars"" has been done 3 times before. It's just not possible to make a ""Star Wars"" film that's as fresh as the first 3.2) We have new characters. Gone are the ones we loved. Star Trek suffered this as well.3) Those who saw the original 3 movies as gaga teens are now pushing 40. It just ain't the same.4) Folks have seen SW:TPM with expectations NO movie could have met. I LIKED the movie and found it well-done. Jar-Jar was really not that annoying! True, we could've learned more of Qui-Gon and Darth Maul. But those are small flaws in an otherwise solid film.I was pleasantly surprised by two small but neat plot twists. The light-sabre-fighting was great. So too was the little romantic twist. Let me explain the title. (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER JUST AHEAD!!!)This movie is about ONE thing and one thing only: the hidden, shadowy, absolutely ruthless drive for power by a man whose public face is totally that of a gentle, helpful, servant-hearted Senator from the planet Naboo. Yes, that nice, kind man who wants to HELP Queen Amidala -- Senator Palpatine. This nice man IS ""The Phantom Menace."" He and the evil Sith Lord lurking in the shadows are ONE AND THE SAME. The nice-guy image and Naboo's entire ""war-with-the-Trade-Federation"" incident -- this entire movie! -- have been planned for years in advance and meticulously engineered by Palpatine SOLELY in order to bring himself to power in the Senate. He is prepared to sacrifice his entire home planet in his lust for power.And the galaxy, even the Jedi, have utterly ZERO CLUE of the hell this ""nice man"" will soon begin to unleash, now that he has the platform of highest elected office to work from. It's TRULY a ""Phantom Menace.""The broad plot is very reminiscent of how Adolf Hitler turned the position of chief political -servant- into an absolute dictatorship in the 1930's -- except that Hitler was more open about his true nature and intentions.The title is brilliant. It hearkens back to the cool way they pulled the wool over our eyes years ago with ""Return of the Jedi,"" the central point of which was Darth Vader's return from evil to good. ""ROTJ""'s WORKING title, leaked to the public as a red herring, was ""REVENGE of the Jedi"" -- a majorly slick move which blinded us all from seeing what the real title actually meant!The Defining Moment of ""The Phantom Menace"" is the moment at which the Queen (or her decoy) stands in the Senate Chamber and calls for a vote of no confidence in the existing Chancellor. This is the one instant about which the entire movie turns.All in all, an outstanding start to the Star Wars saga. I give it a 9 out of 10 -- high marks, for me.",ignore whiners phantom menace is brilliant,warning contains spoiler which explains title having read some reviews posted here before seeing this movie i was pleasantly surprised why are there are so many gripers i think its because 1 star wars has been done 3 times before its just not possible make star wars film thats as fresh as first 3 2 we have new characters gone are ones we loved star trek suffered this as well 3 those who saw original 3 movies as gaga teens are now pushing 40 it just aint same 4 folks have seen sw tpm with expectations no movie could have met i liked movie found it well done jar jar was really not that annoying true we couldve learned more qui gon darth maul but those are small flaws otherwise solid film i was pleasantly surprised by two small but neat plot twists light sabre fighting was great so too was little romantic twist let me explain title warning major spoiler just ahead this movie is about one thing one thing only hidden shadowy absolutely ruthless drive power by man whose public face is totally that gentle helpful servant hearted senator planet naboo yes that nice kind man who wants help queen amidala senator palpatine this nice man is phantom menace he evil sith lord lurking shadows are one same nice guy image naboos entire war with trade federation incident this entire movie have been planned years advance meticulously engineered by palpatine solely order bring himself power senate he is prepared sacrifice his entire home planet his lust power galaxy even jedi have utterly zero clue hell this nice man will soon begin unleash now that he has platform highest elected office work its truly phantom menace broad plot is very reminiscent how adolf hitler turned position chief political servant into absolute dictatorship 1930s except that hitler was more open about his true nature intentions title is brilliant it hearkens back cool way they pulled wool over our eyes years ago with return jedi central point which was darth vaders return evil good rotj s working title leaked public as red herring was revenge jedi majorly slick move which blinded us all seeing what real title actually meant defining moment phantom menace is moment at which queen or her decoy stands senate chamber calls vote no confidence existing chancellor this is one instant about which entire movie turns all all outstanding start star wars saga i give it 9 out 10 high marks me,0.5902142518939394,0.13112807765151513,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.43}"
9,A great addition to the Star Wars legacy,"After a long delay (and much anticipation) we finally got the first part of Lucas's story, and where the trouble all began. Many other people viewed it as a rather sub-par attempt, uncreative and unsurprising. I couldn't disagree more. One could go with the impressive state-of-the-art digital effects, one could go with the great cast of new characters (the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, for instance), the return of old favorites (Kenny Baker as R2D2 or Frank Oz as Yoda), John Williams' ever-wonderful score, the complicated story (I won't bother discussing the plot; everyone knows what it's about by now) or the awesome action sequences (the light saber duel at the end of the film is the best!). It's obvious this film was misunderstood by many, and too many movie-goers set their expectations too high, which is unfair to Mr. Lucas to say the least. I was excited for the chance to see a new Star Wars film, but I took no expectations into the theater with me -- I went in ready for nothing and walked away very satisfied. I saw this film four times in the theater, something I don't do much of these days. Lucas did a great job, and since this film is really only exposition for the overall series, how can one expect it to be a topper to the original trilogy? He's just setting everything up! Give Mr. Lucas a break. If this film had been released first, it would have been the rage of ages just as A New Hope was when it first came out. Everything in this film was very nicely done; the cast and crew all performed their jobs exceptionally. The story was far more complex and interesting than usual, with more going on and more problems to solve. By the way, everyone, the ""Phantom Menace"" referred to by the title is so obvious that very few people truly understood what it was... the Phantom Menace was the orchestrator of the evil deeds, the driving force behind the attacks, the central villain of the picture... a character we see mainly as a hologram (only once otherwise): Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious is the Phantom Menace, and the evil single man who drives the entire plot. The movie was perfectly named. I loved this movie, and it has become one of my favorite Star Wars films (alongside A New Hope). I can't wait for Episode II!",great addition star wars legacy,after long delay much anticipation we finally got first part lucass story where trouble all began many other people viewed it as rather sub par attempt uncreative unsurprising i couldnt disagree more one could go with impressive state art digital effects one could go with great cast new characters awesome liam neeson as qui gon jinn instance return old favorites kenny baker as r2d2 or frank oz as yoda john williams ever wonderful score complicated story i wont bother discussing plot everyone knows what its about by now or awesome action sequences light saber duel at end film is best its obvious this film was misunderstood by many too many movie goers set their expectations too high which is unfair mr lucas say least i was excited chance see new star wars film but i took no expectations into theater with me i went ready nothing walked away very satisfied i saw this film four times theater something i dont do much these days lucas did great job since this film is really only exposition overall series how can one expect it be topper original trilogy hes just setting everything up give mr lucas break if this film had been released first it would have been rage ages just as new hope was when it first came out everything this film was very nicely done cast crew all performed their jobs exceptionally story was far more complex interesting than usual with more going more problems solve by way everyone phantom menace referred by title is so obvious that very few people truly understood what it was phantom menace was orchestrator evil deeds driving force behind attacks central villain picture character we see mainly as hologram only once otherwise darth sidious darth sidious is phantom menace evil single man who drives entire plot movie was perfectly named i loved this movie it has become one my favorite star wars films alongside new hope i cant wait episode ii,0.5868677559000137,0.23245740818321456,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.47}"
