10.0,"Beautiful Film, Even Better Than The Book","For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.Sean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can't stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he's great as a director, having seen his work in ""The Pledge"" and ""The Crossing Guard."" The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays ""Chris McCandless"" (a.k.a. ""Alexander Supertramp"" reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.Two people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (""Ron France"") again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn't acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as ""Tracy Tatro,"" who had a crush on ""Alex."" This young woman is on her way to stardom.Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, ""Rainey"" and ""Jan."" I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker's voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.Knowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don't remember them in the book but I'll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it's a a fascinating story and a beautiful film.",beautiful film even better than book,movie be even better than good book is no small feat yet thats how i felt after watching this film it really impressed me one reasons is fantastic cinematography man this is beautifully filmed at 142 minutes there are lot great scenes admire sean penn directed eddie gautier was director photography i cant stand penn as person but fair is fair i think hes great as director having seen his work pledge crossing guard main actor emile hirsch who plays chris mccandless k alexander supertramp reminded me leonardo dicaprio with his looks build voice inflection he is very credible as young guy who wants nothing do with materialistic society dreams living wilds alaska problem was that he was unprepared underestimated what he was up against two people who fascinated me most here were two extremes age wise hal holbrook kristen stewart it was really great see veteran holbrook ron france again he was about 82 when he made this film hadnt acted film few years he was terrific too he had some most memorable scenes story meanwhile teenager stewart was captivating as tracy tatro who had crush alex this young woman is her way stardom brian dierker catherine keener also were really really interesting as aging hippie couple rainey jan i kept thinking i know this guy when listening dierkers voice finally guessing it was jeff bridges underneath all beard but it dierker guy who rarely acts films knowing book only part film that caught be off guard was young swedish couple i dont remember them book but ill never forget this this film one could debate pros cons chris mccandless hours so no sense going into that here i thought film was pretty kind him you read more book about how he hurt lot people with his silence either way its fascinating story beautiful film,0.7065765765765765,0.4219369369369369,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.25}"
9.0,"TIFF07, review 3: Facing the blind deaf stone aloneInto the Wild","Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minuteswith Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no licenseand it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God.",tiff07 review 3 facing blind deaf stone alone into wild,sean penns new movie into wild arrives wave well regarded novel about college graduate who decides that anger violence civilized society is too much handle commences journey through nature order truly live life as it was meant be this film is wonderful glimpse into life kid wise beyond his years bonds that he creates with people along way victim excess wealth shortage love christopher mccandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge philosophy building up his intellectual strength as well as physical order complete his trek ultimately leading him alaska penn never falls into trap showing too much heartbreak side mccandlesss parents because he doesnt want audience second guess decision he made there is no debate be had here our protagonist has no alternative but get out live off land only being completely self sufficient can he grasp meaning his life one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned emile hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good natured attitude affable charm his character believes that human contact is not necessary happiness never seeks out relationships however his character is so likable that they find him latch not change his mind but experience his level being hopefully learn something him help enlarge his vocabulary life people he meets help him fully grasp decision life wild be able survive it never coming off condescendingly those he crosses paths with hirsch always holds smile his face one scene where he meets up with couple people europe proves how contagious clear outlook life without troubles societal restraints can be these three kids have blast if only few minutes with hirsch being chased by police rafting with no license it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take journey into nature feel freedom full warmth heart that lack stress succeed business world can give all supporting players are magnificent at helping show side mccandless that penn needs display succeed hal holbrook brian dierker catherine keener are by far best these side characters with vince vaughn kirsten stewart adding some charm too dierker keener stewart play hippie flower child type roles allow hirsch show off how modest unselfish he is this is family he deserved have birth he is son they wished their lives had earned them at their best all four together give some most emotionally charged moments film holbrook other hand helps give insight into philosophy that hirsch needs live with order survive loneliness looking him face come alaska it is truly fascinating see how every person adds something his overall experience tools he needs hirsch deserves lot credit because he truly outshines film itself with his dedication sacrifice role length time needed allow him ability lose weight necessary main plot point movie is crazy if time wasnt that long hirsch did it all rapidly im even more impressed with all that there are many instances free dialogue that he needs carry with body language actions alone true much this is enhanced by wonderful soundtrack eddie vedder but evenso it is remarkable performance kudos sean penn gorgeous filming job also he captures countryside with grace while infusing many moments visual style by slow motioning glimpses knowing when show family left behind utilizing informative essential voice over even breaking fourth wall when hirsch first looks into camera at audience it does not seem unnatural slightest but instead amazing link viewers take look into his soul like those that crossed his path have mccandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing calm protectiveness god,0.5204603954603955,0.2463027963027963,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.38}"

10.0,Sneaks Up On You,"INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so I certainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I was blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes the film a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook is amazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (but probably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there are pacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well and the film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remember noticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of Altar Boys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be for every one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain images and moments stayed with me. Penn is getting better as a filmmaker with each movie he makes.",sneaks up you,into wild definitely works as film i had read book so i certainly knew tragic story this young mans life but i was blown away by performances fact have this young talent emile hirsch working with old legendary hal holbrook makes film must see fact their scene near end truck is one best pieces acting i have ever seen film holbrook is amazing there he deserves best supporting actor nomination but probably wont get it film is by no means perfect there are pacing problems but penn does use flashbacks incredibly well film builds power as it goes along hirsch is so real i remember noticing how talented he was indie flick dangerous life altar boys i also thought he was very good so so alpha dog film but penn gets terrific performance out him as well as catherine keener vince vaughn wm hurt kirsten stewart jena malone everyone else that matter i can see how this film might not be every one but i was very moved by it days later certain images moments stayed with me penn is getting better as filmmaker with each movie he makes,0.5201098901098902,0.30148351648351657,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,Blind hero-worship of an idiot (spoilers),"Christopher McCandless lived a silly life and died a silly death. Here was a guy who gave his savings to Oxfam, left home without uttering a word to his family and who thought salvation lay in the wilderness. Too bad, then, that he ate the wrong type of plant and carked it.All the time we're told what complete bastards McCandless' parents are. They drove Christopher into the wild. But what was their crime? Apparently they argued some, even lied a little and their children were born out of wedlock. Okay, they're not the best parents in the world, but do they deserve the harsh treatment that their son dishes out  no letters, no postcards, no phone calls? Well, if you're a massive jerk and you're somehow unable to comprehend that human relationships are more complicated than a simple 'they're good' or 'they're bad', then you may be able to build a case for young Christopher, but if you have any depth of feeling in your soul, you may well think that McCandless punished his parents beyond anything that is reasonable. And also remember that he never contacted his beloved sister. She got the silent treatment as well. However, we have a scene where Christopher goes to call her, but instead he gives his quarter to an old man who is running out of change. What a great guy, we're asked to think. See how he lends a helping hand to strangers. But what about his poor sister, the person who loves him most in the world? This apparently is his one feeble attempt to reach out and tell her that he's okay.But no, Christopher is determined to live alone in the wilderness - to find himself. He wants to escape from a sick society where people treat each other poorly. Hell, his parents even have the nerve to offer to buy him a new car and pay for a Harvard education. Those phonies. Those shallow fakers who give him a home to live in and money to spend. How disgusting they are.Okay, so fair enough, the parents that we're presented with here are stiff, middle class dweebs who are more interested in appearances than anything of any substance, but what had me shaking my head was the assertion that Christopher's disappearance made them better people. Suddenly they're thoughtful and united and in tune with one another. Yes, that's what every strained marriage needs  their children to put them through a couple of years of hell.But what I find most objectionable is the romanticising of the wilderness. Is this the only way that anyone can find themselves, by opening their arms and standing on the edge of a mountain and by kayaking down a river? Isn't there any other way? Apparently not. We even get a scene where Christopher, briefly stranded in LA, looks into a restaurant populated by smarmy bastards and sees a yuppie version of himself. You see what he'd become if he stayed in the city? Hunting moose and talking to hippies is the only way to become a rounded individual.But the disaffection with society in this film is incredibly adolescent. In one scene, Christopher and a buddy of his just start impotently shouting 'society!' Yeah, society sucks and the wilderness is great. The wilderness never starved anyone, ate anyone or froze their balls off. In the eyes of every bear and moose is truth and beauty, and on the cold streets of civilisation is a steady flow of lies and deceit.However, at the end, Christopher maybe finally begins to understand that his quest is full of crap. He writes something along the lines that happiness is meaningless if you don't have someone to share it with. It took you all that time to figure that out? That human connections are what make life bearable? You could have found that out back home, sitting on your couch in your underpants, stuffing Cheetos down your throat.But of course, it's the journey that matters, isn't it? And what a tedious journey it is. Christopher meets hippies and quirky foreigners (who are good) and men with badges (who are bad). He helps people like a shaggy-haired Littlest Hobo and enjoys the milk of human kindness. Well, he enjoys the milk of human kindness as long as the people are poor. Everyone who has no money in this film is an insightful, kind-hearted, itinerant poet. Plus none of the hippies he meets are smelly, ugly, incoherent bastards who drown in their own drug-fuelled nonsense. No, they're inspiring people, who plaster their vehicles with outdated sentiments like 'freedom', 'peace' and 'love'.But it's notable that there's a moment when even a bear won't eat Christopher. Supposedly the bear turns his nose up at him because the kid stays calm or perhaps because he's so sick he doesn't smell that good. But I'd like to think that the bear turns his nose up because it's BS he can smell, and lots of it.However, as we all know from Timothy Treadwell, bears don't mind a bit of BS, but alas the film can't even come close to the genius of Grizzly Man, a film that shows you're no closer to finding reality in the wilderness than you are on the city streets. The problem here is that Penn is celebrating McCandless' folly instead of investigating it. Not for one moment are we asked to consider that this kid is perhaps a bit of an idiot. We're meant to find his journey inspiring and his plight tragic. But instead it's neither of those things. And at the end his death is elevated to grandiose status (it's shot like he's ascending to heaven, that he's communing with god). But in reality his death is what happens when a deluded moron tries to live in the wilderness without a map or enough food.",blind hero worship idiot spoilers,christopher mccandless lived silly life

9.0,Touching,"Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) ""Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,"" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.I think some people are turned off by what they feel was a glorification, but I didn't feel that way at all. We see the trail of tears he leaves behind him, with his parents and sister devastated by not hearing from him, and him ignoring some of the kindly advice he receives along the way. He is also brutal to an old man (Hal Holbrook) who so very generously offers to adopt him, in what is a fantastic scene. Holbrook is also brilliant when he tells the young man ""when you forgive, you love."" We see him take risks which pay off (kayaking down a rampaging river), and of course others which do not (going into the true wild of Alaska without a map or enough preparation). For that he is sometimes vilified or mocked, but I admired him for not conforming like the rest of us, and for living life on his own terms. He certainly was not cheated. And in the end, he has his moment of realization, that ""happiness (is) only real when shared"", which is a moment that is incredibly poignant.I loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: ""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...""And at the end as I thought about McCandless's life, I thought that this passage from Thoreau was nowhere more suitable: ""Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.""",touching,stunning scenery brilliant directing sean penn soulful songs eddie vedder remarkable true story christopher mccandless emile hirsch is college graduate affluent upbringing who decides abandon his possessions money live life out road ala jack london or jack kerouac during parts their lives hes fascinating character because his idealism his nonconformity hes intelligent kind yet he doesnt value human relationships preferring solitude deep connection nature hirsch plays part very well displaying easy personable warmth but at same time determination go his own way damn consequences he also really looks part including scenes where he had lose quite bit weight his character is troubled upbringing that was riddled with strife one moments says so simply sadly some people feel like they dont deserve love they walk away quietly into empty spaces trying close gaps past yet we get feeling that is just one aspect complicated yet simple guy i think some people are turned off by what they feel was glorification but i didnt feel that way at all we see trail tears he leaves behind him with his parents sister devastated by not hearing him him ignoring some kindly advice he receives along way he is also brutal old man hal holbrook who so very generously offers adopt him what is fantastic scene holbrook is also brilliant when he tells young man when you forgive you love we see him take risks which pay off kayaking down rampaging river course others which do not going into true wild alaska without map or enough preparation that he is sometimes vilified or mocked but i admired him not conforming like rest us living life his own terms he certainly was not cheated end he has his moment realization that happiness is only real when shared which is moment that is incredibly poignant i loved literary references film starting with title card quoting byron which seems so perfect there is pleasure pathless woods there is rapture lonely shore there is society where none intrudes by deep sea music its roar i love not man less but nature more at end as i thought about mccandlesss life i thought that this passage thoreau was nowhere more suitable why should we be such desperate haste succeed such desperate enterprises if man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears different drummer let him step music which he hears however measured or far away,0.6052547363031234,0.1949477493832332,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.37}"
8.0,2008's Version of On the Road?,"Who Is Chris McCandless? A true supertramp? An obsessive, emotionally damaged egomaniac? Suicidal thrill-seeker? A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out? Sean Penn's pop-philosophical examination of this young man's voyage across America, to Alaska, and to the depths of his young soul will give you an interpretation at least. While it is not clear exactly whose interpretation we are seeing, it is very clear that Penn respects his subject and gave this film about as much thought and power as he could inject it with. And the film did remind me of something very true about the self-righteous naiveté of youth.I am not concerned at all with the accuracy of the film, and, while it is tempting to compare this film to Werner Herzog's excellent but less fictionalized ""Grizzly Man"", the subjects are really too widely disparate; Herzog and Penn's perspective on humanity is too different to produce a meaningful comparison. The targets of this comparison, too big and too easy. But I will make one comment about the two films - Penn's film is much more or a tribute to its protagonist than Herzog's.I found Into the Wild to be a gripping, thoughtful film. The script was good, but sometimes a bit pretentious - occasionally crossing the line between character development and character worship. Penn's direction and cinematography are masterful. The acting - every member of the cast included - is absolutely excellent.Recommended - but not for light cheerful entertainment.",2008s version road,who is chris mccandless true supertramp obsessive emotionally damaged egomaniac suicidal thrill seeker kerouac like drifter addicted search ever evasive truth high functioning schizophrenic 21st century youth culture reincarnation john gault or just kid going through difficult time looking some distance sort it all out sean penns pop philosophical examination this young mans voyage across america alaska depths his young soul will give you interpretation at least while it is not clear exactly whose interpretation we are seeing it is very clear that penn respects his subject gave this film about as much thought power as he could inject it with film did remind me something very true about self righteous naivet youth i am not concerned at all with accuracy film while it is tempting compare this film werner herzogs excellent but less fictionalized grizzly man subjects are really too widely disparate herzog penns perspective humanity is too different produce meaningful comparison targets this comparison too big too easy but i will make one comment about two films penns film is much more or tribute its protagonist than herzogs i found into wild be gripping thoughtful film script was good but sometimes bit pretentious occasionally crossing line between character development character worship penns direction cinematography are masterful acting every member cast included is absolutely excellent recommended but not light cheerful entertainment,0.5104166666666665,0.1748611111111111,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.36}"
10.0,Justice done.,"The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish.

,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Beautiful, deep, true, adventurous, sad, occasionally funny, real, at times very touching. Based on a real-life novel, it is written and directed by Sean Penn. I have always loved the movie work of Sean Penn. Congratulations and thank you to Mr. Penn on giving me a few hours of though-provoking delight. Can you say Oscar? This movie says it loud and clear! The story; Christopher McCandless, just graduated from college in the early 1990s, goes off on an adventure. He is smitten with books he readsThoreau, London, Byron. He wants no money, so he gives his to needy causes or burns it. Chris is cocky, driven, industrious. He is traumatized by his parents' bad marriage. He tries to work through his anguish. He seems determined to destroy himself just to prove that he has different values than his parents. He is inconsiderate of his family and keeps them worried about his whereabouts and safety, as if a single reassuring phone call would ruin his rebellion. He fancies himself a philosopher, but acts the petulant child. It is a great credit to the film that we see these character flaws in our hero. Off on the road, he makes a number of foolish choices  and suffers from some of them. Other foolish choices, such as daring to kayak a rapid river, bring him joy. He meets a lot of people and almost all are kind to him. His interactions with people are intense, the kind you have when you are planning to run off and disappear while you are still a mysterious entity. He avoids getting too close to anyone.The movie is gorgeous. Mountains, plains, sky, rivers, animals. The acting is fantastic, totally believable. The actors are incredible and perfectly cast  Catherine Keener as an aging hippie vagabond, Vince Vaughn as a wacky farmer growing who knows what, William Hurt as Chris' potbellied suburbanite dad, Marcia Gay Harden as the type of mom who breeds children who wants to run off to the wilderness to escape from her. Emile Hirsch plays Chris, and does a great job of it. When an actual photo of the real Chris McCandless comes on screen, we see that Hirsch resembles him. Original songs by Eddie Vedder give the right feel  that of a well-to-do young white man heading out on a chosen adventure, getting gritty by choice. His goal is to get to Alaska, but on the way there, he hits many other states and Mexico, too.Chris is a clueless kid from the warm South. He plans to go to Alaska, yet only arrives with any needed equipment because kind folks force it upon him  a machete, warm clothes, rubber boots. He's highly educated and gets good grades, yet, early on his trip, ignores a big sign that warns of flash floods. That prepares us that we are going to wince many times at his low level of common sense, while at the same time reveling in his physical strength and willingness to press on. At one point, Chris passes through Los Angeles. He is dirty, hungry, tired, and goes to a downtown mission shelter. The other men there are also dirty, hungry, and tired, but not of their own choosing. It is not their adventure, it is their life. He realizes fast that he does not want to feel categorized with men who are in dire straits due to misfortune and not due to following their own adventure. The movie shows Chris as an honorable young man. I do not want to give away any of the plot, so I'll just say  the young man has principles and so does the movie.A few parts of the movie confused me. After Chris's college graduation, he meets h is parents at a restaurant. He brings with him a lovely young woman, obviously his date. Weirdly, it turns out that she is his sister! There is more confusion when Chris picks up work on a farm run by Wayne, the Vince Vaughn character. What are they growing or doing? What's up? There is an unintentionally funny scene where an old man tells Chris that he does not have time for adventures because he is too busy with leather. I thought the old guy was confessing being into whips and chaps. But no, he has a workshop where he tools leather. There were a couple spots where the editing distracted from the movie. I saw a preview; maybe it was a rough cut. There's a scene on the farm where a triple screen is used  like a cheesy commercial. Another scene, where Chris is eating an apple, is a series of jump cuts, which I really liked. It seemed an homage to French auteur filmmakers. But it ends with Chris mugging at the camera. With it, Sean Penn breaks the believability and acknowledges that yes, this is just us making a movie. There is another part where Chris is in a car with the older man who is dropping him off. As they pull up, there is an inexplicable cutaway shot of what looks to be the head of a cannon. Much of the movie is like a travel montage or music video involving mountains and sky. The scenes are so beautiful. I know people that have elements of Chris in them. And I think I've met all the characters he runs into out on the road.",one best movies ive ever seen,one best movies ive ever seen beautiful deep true adventurous sad occasionally funny real at times very touching based real life novel it is written directed by sean penn i have always loved movie work sean penn congratulations thank you mr penn giving me few hours though provoking delight can you say oscar this movie says it loud clear story christopher mccandless just graduated college early 1990s goes off adventure he is smitten with books he reads thoreau london byron he wants no money so he gives his needy causes or burns it chris is cocky driven industrious he is traumatized by his parents bad marriage he tries work through his anguish he seems determined destroy himself just prove that he has different values than his parents he is inconsiderate his family keeps them worried about his whereabouts safety as if single reassuring phone call would ruin his rebellion he fancies himself philosopher but acts petulant child it is great credit film that we see these character flaws our hero off road he makes number foolish choices suffers some them other foolish choices such as daring kayak rapid river bring him joy he meets lot people almost all are kind him his interactions with people are intense kind you have when you are planning run off disappear while you are still mysterious entity he avoids getting too close anyone movie is gorgeous mountains plains sky rivers animals acting is fantastic totally believable actors are incredible perfectly cast catherine keener as aging hippie vagabond vince vaughn as wacky farmer growing who knows what william hurt as chris potbellied suburbanite dad marcia gay harden as type mom who breeds children who wants run off wilderness escape her emile hirsch plays chris does great job it when actual photo real chris mccandless comes screen we see that hirsch resembles him original songs by eddie vedder give right feel that well do young white man heading out chosen adventure getting gritty by choice his goal is get alaska but way there he hits many other states mexico too chris is clueless kid warm south he plans go alaska yet only arrives with any needed equipment because kind folks force it upon him machete warm clothes rubber boots hes highly educated gets good grades yet early his trip ignores big sign that warns flash floods that prepares us that we are going wince many times at his low level common sense while at same time reveling his physical strength willingness press at one point chris passes through los angeles he is dirty hungry tired goes downtown mission shelter other men there are also dirty hungry tired but not their own choosing it is not their adventure it is their life he realizes fast that he does not want feel categorized with men who are dire straits due misfortune not due following their own adventure movie shows chris as honorable young man i do not want give away any plot so ill just say young man has principles so does movie few parts movie confused me after chriss college graduation he meets h is parents at restaurant he brings with him lovely young woman obviously his date weirdly it turns out that she is his sister there is more confusion when chris picks up work farm run by wayne vince vaughn character what are they growing or doing whats up there is unintentionally funny scene where old man tells chris that he does not have time adventures because he is too busy with leather i thought old guy was confessing being into whips chaps but no he has workshop where he tools leather there were couple spots where editing distracted movie i saw preview maybe it was rough cut theres scene farm where triple screen is used like cheesy commercial another scene where chris is eating apple is series jump cuts which i really liked it seemed homage french auteur filmmakers but it ends with chris mugging at camera with it sean penn breaks believability acknowledges that yes this is just us making movie there is another part where chris is car with older man who is dropping him off as they pull up there is inexplicable cutaway shot what looks be head cannon much movie is like travel montage or music video involving mountains sky scenes are so beautiful i know people that have elements chris them i think ive met all characters he runs into out road,0.5494849368318756,0.16627672497570448,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.42}"
7.0,"""Is anybody here?""","I come away from this movie somewhat conflicted, not about the picture itself but of it's principal character, Christopher McCandless. I say that with some reservation as well, because when I was his age and fresh out of college, I spent a lot of time steeped in existentialist thought trying to figure out the meaning of life and how to conduct my own. In McCandless's case, there was also the family dysfunction at work, something that I never had to contend with growing up.At the heart of the movie, I don't have a lot of problem with Chris's philosophy of ""If you want something in life, reach out and grab it"". The paradox in that statement occurred exactly at the time he was saying those words to guitarist Tracy (Kristen Stewart) who fell hard for Chris at the traveler's camp. She was 'reaching out to grab it' and things weren't going to work out for her in quite the same way. So life has it's way of throwing those kinds of curveballs at you.No doubt some will find the message of uninhibited freedom and life without constraints to be an appealing one, but in the final analysis, doesn't the mere fact of existence require one to do the prudent thing? Chris McCandless's death was so unnecessary. Chances are, had he gone on to live say, a full five or ten years in the wild, he might have come to an entirely different conclusion about the meaning of his life and how to be a productive citizen of the world. His reading of Tolstoy offered a clue to an acceptable view of happiness - work which may be of some use, rest, nature, books and music. Loneliness didn't seem to be part of that equation.",is anybody here,i come away this movie somewhat conflicted not about picture itself but its principal character christopher mccandless i say that with some reservation as well because when i was his age fresh out college i spent lot time steeped existentialist thought trying figure out meaning life how conduct my own mccandlesss case there was also family dysfunction at work something that i never had contend with growing up at heart movie i dont have lot problem with chriss philosophy if you want something life reach out grab it paradox that statement occurred exactly at time he was saying those words guitarist tracy kristen stewart who fell hard chris at travelers camp she was reaching out grab it things werent going work out her quite same way so life has its way throwing those kinds curveballs at you no doubt some will find message uninhibited freedom life without constraints be appealing one but final analysis doesnt mere fact existence require one do prudent thing chris mccandlesss death was so unnecessary chances are had he gone live say full five or ten years wild he might have come entirely different conclusion about meaning his life how be productive citizen world his reading tolstoy offered clue acceptable view happiness work which may be some use rest nature books music loneliness didnt seem be part that equation,0.4791666666666667,0.10279356060606058,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.52}"

,A Prairie Home Companion,"Sean Penn's ""Into The Wild"" is perhaps best viewed as being part of a recent wave of eco-themed films (""Wall-E"", ""Avatar"", ""The Happening"", ""An Inconvenient Truth"", ""Grizzly Man"", ""Dreamland"", ""Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""Antichrist"", ""Day After Tomorrow"", ""Happy Feet"" etc). Most of these films urge their audiences to ""return to nature"", ""retreat to some pastoral existence"" or ""save the planet"" (without looking at the systemic or economic forces which completely undermine or neutralise such wants).Interestingly, aside from ""Antichrist"", ""Grizzly Man"" and ""Into The Wild"", nature in these films is always portrayed as being some kind of mystical, ""balanced"" system. While mega-studios, quite ironically, advise us to harmonize with nature, ""smaller"" directors (Penn, Herzog, Von Trier) seem to instead posit worlds in which nature is vile and base. Nature is still portrayed as being majestic and splendid, but is then associated with asphyxiation and choking, death and rot. The only harmony – as Werner Herzog once famously said – is that of overwhelming and collective murder. Murder, then, is the central theme of both ""Grizzly Man"" and ""Into The Wild"". Like Sydney Pollack's ""Jerremiah Johnson"", both films are about young men (Christopher McCandless in Penn's film, Timothy Treadwell in Herzog's) who cut themselves off from civilisation and venture off into the wilderness. Of course both Herzog and Penn initially romanticise their central characters' flights. They see beauty in this journey and a kind of crazy inner strength (McCandless rejects vapid materialism, 9 to 5 routines and sees the modern word as being a hindrance which atrophies humanity and conscience ). But both artists are also careful to counter this idealism with nature at its most violent. And so both films find their heroes ""leaving civilisation"", but only because they've first suffered a total, psychological collapse. They now disbelieve in their Master Signifiers, in their Symbolic Orders, and see civilisation itself as being representative of that which is arbitrary and chaotic. Both films then end with the deaths of their central characters, McCandless killed by a lowly poisonous berry, Treadwell killed by a mighty grizzly bear. This is not romanticism: the impetus for our adventures is something sad and pathetic, even if they're absolutely right. Their problem is that they've diagnosed civilisation but idealised Nature, a fatal failing; mankind's history is a history of battling the wild outdoors. Respect Nature. Approach with caution.And so both Treadwell and McCandless are portrayed as being disenchanted idealists who cut themselves off from a world they no longer feel apart of, no longer trust, no longer believe in. But while Penn romanticises Christopher's idealistic dream of ""entering the wilderness"", he is careful to counter this with nature at its most violent. Christopher hunts for food but recoils from maggots, Christopher attempts to cross a river, but nature's violent highways prove too powerful, Christopher forages for berries, but eats only poisonous weeds which ultimately kill him.The result is that Penn celebrates disenchantment and urges one to disconnect (mental breakdown, oft the precursor to wisdom), even as he warns that drifting too far is itself a form of suicide or self-destruction. Chris wants to cut himself off from mankind (the film opens with a quote from the Romantic Movement which advocates ""ostracizing oneself from humanity""), but also learns that ""Happiness Is Real Only When Shared"" (the last dreams he has is of hugging his parents). And that's Penn's irony: it is the connections that Christopher makes with other people as he continues along on his journey which allowed him to survive in the wilderness for as long as he did. When towards the end of the film Christopher turns down an offer to live with an elderly man, he effectively gave up entirely on humanity. This total disconnection, this suicidal action, is ultimately what the film warns of.The kind of balance that the film longs for is thus similar to the teachings of Thoreau, who advocated finding a middle ground between rejecting and fully embracing the wilderness. The people Chris meets (and rejects) along his journey are thus in possession of the life he longs for.Elsewhere the film is about the enchantment of text and the romance of words. Krakauer wrote about Chris not only because Chris' journey was inspired by idealistic books (Chris takes literature rather than food with him) but because Chris was himself a writer and left behind numerous documents. What the film thus does is sets up a war between the word (fantasy) and the image (world). As each level of text is one step removed from reality, image eventually wins, the image of a berry and the failure to correctly read it being what ultimately kills Chris.Audiences typically view Chris as either a ""hero"" or a ""jerk"", but he's more a lost, fragile child. Having learnt that everything he knew about his parents and his own history was a lie, Chris began to distrust everything. Suddenly all truths were shattered. The only way for Christopher's mind to cope with this subjective destitution was to then enter a little fantasy world in which he's a ""noble adventurer"". As he loves meta-acting, Penn thus has actor Emile Hirsch play Christopher as a wounded guy playing the role of the very romantic hero he reads about in books.Elsewhere, like Kirk Douglas' ""Lonely Are The Brave"", Penn contrast modern technology with primitivism. He stresses the artificiality of the caravans and abandoned buses which Christopher relies on to survive, and counterpoints Christopher's physical death with a near spiritual shot of a modern passenger jet. The film does not condemn modern technology, it recognises it as a necessity. The film then ends with Christopher's body seemingly ""transcending"" into heaven. The film then rewinds, his body sucked into the ground, Penn's camera pulling back such that Christopher's corpse seems to be asphyxiated by Nature. 8.5/10 – Worth two viewings.",prairie home

9.0,One hell of a young man,"Sean Penn's 'Into the Wild' is a passionate and faithful evocation of Jon Krakauer's book about Chris McCandless. It's the troubling and complex story of a young idealist and seeker who was also a rebellious child and beloved brother who gave away his $24,000 savings to Oxfam after college, went off in an old Datsun and left his family behind, and disappeared for two years wandering the country, only to be found by hunters dead of poisoning and starvation in an abandoned bus in the wilds of Alaska.It's been said as a criticism of Penn's movie that it isn't as neutral about McCandless as Krakauers's book. It is true that Emile Hirsch as Chris, who called himself Alexander Supertramp on the road, is such a joyous and appealing character it's hard to focus on the arbitrariness and foolhardiness of the young man. Hirsch gives his all. He has shown his knack for playing bad good boysparticularly in 'Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' and 'Lords of Dogtown'and for playing wild misfitsin the little seen 'The Mudge Boy.' This is the first great role he's had, and he deserves it. His work is a wonderful melding of ""negative capability"" and generosity. It comes naturally to him to embody exuberance, boldness, and joy. If there was something off-putting or stern in the real-life McCandless, it's not very noticeable in Hirsch. But Hirsch's enthusiasm makes sense of the great adventure and self-discovery this story recounts. (Sadly, McCandless never seemed more ready to embrace life, and to overcome all his doubts about people and family, than right near his end.) All the faults McCandless had and mistakes he made made are there in the story as Penn tells it; if he has altered facts (and necessarily left some out), he hasn't done so to make the young man's plans seem clearer or his choices wiser, and the movie is replete with specific detail.'Into the Wild,' true, is itself a little on the wild and loud side, with its occasionally obtrusive Eddie Vedder soundtrack, it's insanely vivid characterslike the young Danish couple on the banks of the Colorado, Vince Vaughan's intense, grinning grain farmer, Hal Holbrook's fabulously sad, shut-down old widower. There is another kind of overload in the occasional use of split screens. But it all unfolds very much as Jon Krakauer's book does, with interludes at the ""magic bus"" where Chris met his doom constantly intercut with episodes from his travels earlier during his two wander-years. And incredible episodes they are: roaming with a warm hippie couple; illegally and hair-raisingly running the Colorado rapids in a kayak; working in the big grain elevator and loving it; riding the rails and loving that too, till he's caught and beaten; escaping a flophouse in L.A.; staying with old Mr. Franz (Holbrook), learning from him how to engrave leather belts and persuading him to climb a mountain; and then off into the hostile snow country with a big back pack and sheer will. Many voiceovers from Chris's sister add more about the sibling relationship than was in the book; the family ""fearlessly"" cooperated in the film-making. McCandless's stern NASA honcho dad (William Hurt) and uptight mother (Marcia Gay Harden) are as unappealing as he saw them, but are not overdrawnor underrepresented. Among other things Sean Penn's film is a remarkable balancing act.It's obvious this story had to be made into a movie, and it's hard to imagine how anyone could have done it better than Penn and his fine cast. All Penn's directorial efforts have been heartfelt and earnest, but this of his films thus far is his greatest artistic success and has the widest appeal. Into the Wild is a good balance of the emotionally wrenching and the thought-provoking. It contains so many themes and poses so many questionsabout youth, about time, about responsibility. Chris isn't to be confused with Herzog's 'Grizzly Man'. He's aware of the danger of nature. It's just that he has the hubris of daring to approach it with too little knowledge and experience, knowing the risk, and taking it. And indeed he might have made it and gotten back out, but for two or three terrible mistakes. Nature is unforgiving.Chris McCandless was unforgiving too. But if he read the romantic Bible of his own life lived in those intense two years and lived to tell of them, the film suggests, he would have learned to love and forgive. He was bright, talented, passionate about life, a seeker or rare moral fervor who read and thought and recorded all that happened in those last days. His death was sadly premature. But there are signsthey're clear in Krakauer's bookthat he made an impact on the world he inhabited and the people he met. Vince Vaughan's character shouts, ""You're one hell of a young man. You're one hell of a young man!"" He died terribly alone. But maybe the tree that falls in the forest is heard after all. ""Quant'e' bella giovanezza,"" goes an Italian renaissance verse, ""Che si fugge tuttavia."" How beautiful is youth, which flees straightaway. McCandless' story embodies those lines.'Into the Wild' seems more moving and thought-provoking than any other recent film, and may be destined to become some kind of classican 'Easy Rider', some have said, for our times. It's about society and nature, about family, about idealism and aloneness; most of all it's about the dangerous, heartbreakingly brief and beautiful romanticism of youth. In those two years, Chris McCandless lived a whole, remarkable, life. And Sean Penn has captured those two years for us.",one hell young man,sean penns into wild is passionate faithful evocation jon krakauers book about chris mccandless its troubling complex story young idealist seeker who was also rebellious child beloved brother who gave away his 24 000 savings oxfam after college went off old datsun left his family behind disappeared two years wandering country only be found by hunters dead poisoning starvation abandoned bus wilds alaska its been said as criticism penns movie that it isnt as neutral about mccandless as krakauerss book it is true that emile hirsch as chris who called himself alexander supertramp road is such joyous appealing character its hard focus arbitrariness foolhardiness young man hirsch gives his all he has shown his knack playing bad good boys particularly dangerous lives altar boys lords dogtown playing wild misfits little seen mudge boy this is first great role hes had he deserves it his work is wonderful melding negative capability generosity it comes naturally him embody exuberance boldness joy if there was something off putting or stern real life mccandless its not very noticeable hirsch but hirschs enthusiasm makes sense great adventure self discovery this story recounts sadly mccandless never seemed more ready embrace life overcome all his doubts about people family than right near his end all faults mccandless had mistakes he made made are there story as penn tells it if he has altered facts necessarily left some out he hasnt done so make young mans plans seem clearer or his choices wiser movie is replete with specific detail into wild true is itself little wild loud side with its occasionally obtrusive eddie vedder soundtrack its insanely vivid characters like young danish couple banks colorado vince vaughans intense grinning grain farmer hal holbrooks fabulously sad shut down old widower there is another kind overload occasional use split screens but it all unfolds very much as jon krakauers book does with interludes at magic bus where chris met his doom constantly intercut with episodes his travels earlier during his two wander years incredible episodes they are roaming with warm hippie couple illegally hair raisingly running colorado rapids kayak working big grain elevator loving it riding rails loving that too till hes caught beaten escaping flophouse l staying with old mr franz holbrook learning him how engrave leather belts persuading him climb mountain then off into hostile snow country with big back pack sheer will many voiceovers chriss sister add more about sibling relationship than was book family fearlessly cooperated film making mccandlesss stern nasa honcho dad william hurt uptight mother marcia gay harden are as unappealing as he saw them but are not overdrawn or underrepresented among other things sean penns film is remarkable balancing act its obvious this story had be made into movie its hard imagine how anyone could have done it better than penn his fine cast all penns directorial efforts have been heartfelt earnest but this his films thus far is his greatest artistic success has widest appeal into wild is good balance emotionally wrenching thought provoking it contains so many themes poses so many questions about youth about time about responsibility chris isnt be confused with herzogs grizzly man hes aware danger nature its just that he has hubris daring approach it with too little knowledge experience knowing risk taking it indeed he might have made it gotten back out but two or three terrible mistakes nature is unforgiving chris mccandless was unforgiving too but if he read romantic bible his own life lived those intense two years lived tell them film suggests he would have learned love forgive he was bright talented passionate about life seeker or rare moral fervor who read thought recorded all that happened those last days his death was sadly premature but there are signs theyre clear krakauers book that he made impact world he inhabited people he met vince vaughans character shouts youre one hell young man youre one hell young man he died terribly alone but maybe tree that falls forest is heard after all quante bella giovanezza goes italian renaissance verse che si fugge tuttavia how beautiful is youth which flees straightaway mccandless story embodies those lines into wild seems more moving thought provoking than any other recent film may be destined become some kind classic easy rider some have said our times its about society nature about family about idealism aloneness most all its about dangerous heartbreakingly brief beautiful romanticism youth those two years chris mccandless lived whole remarkable life sean penn has captured those two years us,0.5511812934540208,0.1552561327561327,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.37}"
1.0,Dumb and futile death by misadventure by a spoiled rich kid,"This really stupid glorification tribute film financed by the extremely wealthy McCandless whose son died a futile death from poisoning , starvation and overexposure in the Alaskan wilderness. Having graduated from Emory University the super spoiled typical rich kid rebels against what is expected of him by his parents. Like most of his type knowing full well he can always fall back on his parents wealth when it suits them to do so he then sets out on squandering his allowance after reportedly having donating his allowance to charity. The character playing his sister provides a narrative throughout the film providing a rational that his parents premarital experiences as well as their highly strained marriage as the reason for his escape into irresponsible living.This mainly fantasized account of Chris McCandless's last stage of life includes all these encounters that paint him as a much loved eccentric character idolized by young women, a grain farmer, welfare workers, burnt out hippies and an old man who wants to adopt him. He breaks ecological laws by rafting down the Colorado river without a permit to Mexico where he sweet talks his way back into the USA without ID papers. McCandless then finishes his little road trip adventure with a hunting trip to the Alaskan wilderness. Despite being fully equipped and armed the idiot McCandless manages to die of a combination of starvation, poisoning and over exposure. Sean Penn directs this silly film which will no doubt find fans amongst superficial young women and other well to do hippie types. I suspect these types of films inspire young people to take foolish paths in life that only the rich can afford to take and have seen this happen to friends of mine with similar disastrous consequences. I'm giving it one star because maybe it will inspire other idiots to perish in the wilderness. I was not keen on the wasteful shooting of Alaskan wildlife for McCandless's camping experiment.

3.0,"Oh, whatever...","Sean Penn did a good job bringing the film to life. However, I have so many issues with this film.The cinematography is beautiful, helped off course by the stunning landscapes. The dialogue is very poetic, and the performances were good. The extreme close-up photography, though, was a bit nauseating at times.The film can easily be seen as a celebration of life (albeit a bit extreme!), and to explore and experience the beauty of nature. Nowadays we tend to forget nature actually exists. As for Chris, he did some nonsensical things along the way. Often, he came across as extremely ungrateful, and even selfish. His argument for not needing (any) money was absurd.There were moments I felt the film was stagnating, and I wanted to push it along. 148 minutes is just way too long for a film like this to sit through, especially also since it is slow moving, and the non-linear narration. So, although it is a very well made film, - and there probably are a few lessons to be learnt here - it simply wasn't entertaining enough.Based on fact, I'm wondering whether I should actually feel sorry for real-life Chris McCandless, on who's adventures the film is based. He brought what happened to him upon himself. Pure self-indulgence! He didn't think his adventure through properly and didn't plan ahead, and certainly didn't do enough research - typical spoiled brat! Having given his ENTIRE savings to charity tells me he was never planning on returning, and that this was probably a suicide mission.After more than tow hours and an ending I somehow predicted, I was really glad when it ended.",oh whatever,sean penn did good job bringing film life however i have so many issues with this film cinematography is beautiful helped off course by stunning landscapes dialogue is very poetic performances were good extreme close up photography though was bit nauseating at times film can easily be seen as celebration life albeit bit extreme explore experience beauty nature nowadays we tend forget nature actually exists as chris he did some nonsensical things along way often he came across as extremely ungrateful even selfish his argument not needing any money was absurd there were moments i felt film was stagnating i wanted push it along 148 minutes is just way too long film like this sit through especially also since it is slow moving non linear narration so although it is very well made film there probably are few lessons be learnt here it simply wasnt entertaining enough based fact im wondering whether i should actually feel sorry real life chris mccandless whos adventures film is based he brought what happened him upon himself pure self indulgence he didnt think his adventure through properly didnt plan ahead certainly didnt do enough research typical spoiled brat having given his entire savings charity tells me he was never planning returning that this was probably suicide mission after more than tow hours ending i somehow predicted i was really glad when it ended,0.626934523809524,0.12211681547619051,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.45}"
7.0,A most unique...but not entirely pleasant viewing experience.,"There is a certain irony to the story from ""Into the Wild"", as Hollywood, the land of excess, does a film about a man who got rid of all his possessions in order to live simply off the land. It would be like me (at 250 pounds) writing a diet book! Now I am not attacking Sean Penn or the film or any of the ones who made the film...but in general I just cannot associate Hollywood with the life of Christopher McCandless!The story begins with Chris graduating from Emory University, a prestigious school in Georgia. Now you'd think he would be on the fast track to financial success...but instead he gives away nearly everything he has and heads into the wilderness to live a bit like a nomad. It seems Chris was tired of a life of acquiring things and wanted to live simply...and mostly alone. He also seemed to be running away from himself....or at least who he and his family were. Ultimately his life would take him from the American Southwest all the way to the wilds of Alaska. This tale is based on a true story, as told by Chris' sister in the film.I think this is a movie where I enjoyed the style more than the story itself. I liked the simple style, the simple music and the mostly lesser-named stars in the picture. I also respect how much Emile Hirsch put himself out for the role...his weight loss throughout the movie was dramatic. As a trained therapist, however, I couldn't help but think the Chris would have benefited a lot from therapy before taking such a huge leap in his life. He was clearly, in an odd way, suicidal and I was concerned how the film seemed to romanticize this. Overall, an interesting but often unpleasant and overlong movie...worth seeing once but not a film I'd rush to recommend.",most unique but not entirely pleasant viewing experience,there is certain irony story into wild as hollywood land excess does film about man who got rid all his possessions order live simply off land it would be like me at 250 pounds writing diet book now i am not attacking sean penn or film or any ones who made film but general i just cannot associate hollywood with life christopher mccandless story begins with chris graduating emory university prestigious school georgia now youd think he would be fast track financial success but instead he gives away nearly everything he has heads into wilderness live bit like nomad it seems chris was tired life acquiring things wanted live simply mostly alone he also seemed be running away himself or at least who he his family were ultimately his life would take him american southwest all way wilds alaska this tale is based true story as told by chris sister film i think this is movie where i enjoyed style more than story itself i liked simple style simple music mostly lesser named stars picture i also respect how much emile hirsch put himself out role his weight loss throughout movie was dramatic as trained therapist however i couldnt help but think chris would have benefited lot therapy before taking such huge leap his life he was clearly odd way suicidal i was concerned how film seemed romanticize this overall interesting but often unpleasant overlong movie worth seeing once but not film id rush recommend,0.4931292517006803,0.10804885590599875,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.4}"
1.0,luddite fetishization of a coddled man in way over his head,"I found something utterly fascinating in the true story of Christopher McCandless, venturing out into the ""wild"" of Alaska with basically nothing but a gun and some food, and eventually succumbing to the inevitable. I passed no judgment on him or his decisions when I read through the story, focusing more on the mystery of what drove him to a vagabond existence culminating in total hermitage from which he absolutely could not survive. The cliché of ""the devil is in the details"" is one horribly true here, and tends to tear apart the story. In truth, McCandless essentially committed suicide. He refused all the necessary help to survive in the cold, did not even learn how to dry meat, and, had he had a map, could have easily walked back to civilization at almost any point in time. In fact, we can learn almost nothing from McCandless or his time spent in the wild, as his journal entries are as mindless and empty and almost completely devoid of any real content. They literally amount to things like ""Day 2: Fall through the ice day."" ""Day 4: Magic bus day."" ""Day 9: Weakness."" ""Day 10: Snowed in."" ""Day 68: Beaver Dam. Disaster."" ""Day 107 (the last entry): Beautiful berries"" Going into the actual film itself, we get virtually none of this. Instead we are taken on a tediously long, droning journey that covers almost none of the survival aspects and just covers his wandering through the US in the years leading up to the event. Throughout this ""journey"" we're treated to overly dramatic musical montages waxing poetic on how ""society, man, society is just society, man"" ranting and railing with all the emptiness and incoherence of someone with basic understanding of almost everything, but knowledge of almost nothing.Life sure does sucks for a rich white kid who graduates from a prestigious university with nearly all A's, the movie tells us. How can you be happy with things like money and a job instead of living in the woods, hanging out with psychotically upbeat Danish tourists you meet after barely surviving a dangerous river paddling you jump in with 0 paddling experience, ignoring the guy who tells you you need to sign on with a professional because you could die. What does he know? Society, man. Screw society, man. The truth about the abuse he and his sister suffered from their parents wasn't revealed publicly by the time his movie was made (though she did disclose it off the record to the book author Jon Krakauer), so it's never made fully explicit here. But the whole theme of the movie is such that it doesn't matter, because it doesn't easily fit into the theme that ""society sucks and you can only be happy living in the woods"". The immense scale of the romanticization is insufferable. It becomes painfully pretentious almost immediately and it makes the protagonist thoroughly unlikeable; a vapid, empty vessel literally living the dream of the vapid spoiled white kid who worships nature and thinks modern society is a drag. The least I can say about this fictional version of McCandless is he is at least completely devoid of the self-righteous spite and meanness of a character like Holden Caulfield. He's not rubbing our faces in this pretentious message; the film itself is, and sometimes it seems as if he's just as much a victim as we are, having his adventure luridly fetishized as if he were an idol, and not someone who was way in over their head. I can't help but think of a similar story of someone who died in the Alaska wilderness, Carl McCunn in 1981. He went with almost 2 tons of food and supplies, multiple weapons, and actually left highly detailed journal entries telling a tragic story of a man who made a rather different mistake; He did not make it clear to the pilot who left him in the wilderness to return for him 5 months later. As 5 months slips into 6 months, you can clearly feel the pain in his entries as he realizes he is likely never coming back alive, and no one is likely to come looking for him. At one point, he is even spotted by a state trooper flying over in a plane, but laments in his journal that he apparently accidentally signaled to the trooper that he was okay and not in need of rescue. His final entry is a plea to God to forgive him and look over his family, then writing ""They say it doesn't hurt"" before taking his own life rather than freeze to death. There's nothing remotely like that in this film. The film barely lingers on Chris's experience of solitude in the wild, preferring to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his silly adventures, interspersed with upbeat montage after montage set to popular music",luddite fetishization coddled man way over his head,i found something utterly fascinating true story christopher mccandless venturing out into wild alaska with basically nothing but gun some food eventually succumbing inevitable i passed no judgment him or his decisions when i read through story focusing more mystery what drove him vagabond existence culminating total hermitage which he absolutely could not survive clich devil is details is one horribly true here tends tear apart story truth mccandless essentially committed suicide he refused all necessary help survive cold did not even learn how dry meat had he had map could have easily walked back civilization at almost any point time fact we can learn almost nothing mccandless or his time spent wild as his journal entries are as mindless empty almost completely devoid any real content they literally amount things like day 2 fall through ice day day 4 magic bus day day 9 weakness day 10 snowed day 68 beaver dam disaster day 107 last entry beautiful berries going into actual film itself we get virtually none this instead we are taken tediously long droning journey that covers almost none survival aspects just covers his wandering through us years leading up event throughout this journey were treated overly dramatic musical montages waxing poetic how society man society is just society man ranting railing with all emptiness incoherence someone with basic understanding almost everything but knowledge almost nothing life sure does sucks rich white kid who graduates prestigious university with nearly all as movie tells us how can you be happy with things like money job instead living woods hanging out with psychotically upbeat danish tourists you meet after barely surviving dangerous river paddling you jump with 0 paddling experience ignoring guy who tells you you need sign with professional because you could die what does he know society man screw society man truth about abuse he his sister suffered their parents wasnt revealed publicly by time his movie was made though she did disclose it off record book author jon krakauer so its never made fully explicit here but whole theme movie is such that it doesnt matter because it doesnt easily fit into theme that society sucks you can only be happy living woods immense scale romanticization is insufferable it becomes painfully pretentious almost immediately it makes protagonist thoroughly unlikeable vapid empty vessel literally living dream vapid spoiled white kid who worships nature thinks modern society is drag least i can say about this fictional version mccandless is he is at least completely devoid self righteous spite meanness character like holden caulfield hes not rubbing our faces this pretentious message film itself is sometimes it seems as if hes just as much victim as we are having his adventure luridly fetishized as if he were idol not someone who was way over their head i cant help but think similar story someone who died alaska wilderness carl mccunn 1981 he went with almost 2 tons food supplies multiple weapons actually left highly detailed journal entries telling tragic story man who made rather different mistake he did not make it clear pilot who left him wilderness return him 5 months later as 5 months slips into 6 months you can clearly feel pain his entries as he realizes he is likely never coming back alive no one is likely come looking him at one point he is even spotted by state trooper flying over plane but laments his journal that he apparently accidentally signaled trooper that he was okay not need rescue his final entry is plea god forgive him look over his family then writing they say it doesnt hurt before taking his own life rather than freeze death theres nothing remotely like that this film film barely lingers chriss experience solitude wild preferring go with his silly adventures interspersed with upbeat montage after montage set popular music,0.48954945799457994,0.053760162601626034,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
,Poignant adventure story,"When Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduated from college, he had one goal in life - to finally break away from his unhappy family and the constraints of society in general and live off the land in Alaska. The episodic film flashes back and forth between Chris' adventures in Alaska and the months leading up to it, focusing on the people who befriended him, including an aging hippie couple and a lonely, old man (well-played by the venerable Hal Holbrook).Based on a true story and narrated with many of Chris' journal entries, the film is an emotional roller coaster; I was torn between admiring his youthful idealism and courage and hating him for the pain he inflicted on his family. The movie feels much like a documentary as it follows Chris hitchhiking and working his way across the country and then surviving, at first, quite well in Alaska.Emile Hirsch is well-cast as Chris and makes you care about him right from the start. He did all of his demanding stunts himself and even lost 40 pounds to play the ailing Chris. It is a very touching story. Amid the splendor of the wilderness but ultimately alone, Chris finally understood that happiness is only real when it is shared.

1.0,Good movie about an idiot.,"This is a really good movie, unfortunately I could not remove myself from the fact that the main character was a complete moron. First of all contrary to what people feel, ""dropping out of society"" is a lazy, b.s. way of rebelling against corporate society, and never achieves anything but a self fulfilled prophecy. Here is what native Alaskans felt about this fool in general. ""Krakauer's book made McCandless a heroic figure to many.Unlike Krakauer and many readers of his book, who have a largely sympathetic view of McCandless, some Alaskans have negative views of both McCandless and those who romanticize his fate. McCandless was unaware that a hand-operated tram crossed the river a quarter mile from the Stampede Trail, while a nearby shelter was stocked with emergency supplies, as described in Krakauer's book. However, the three nearby cabins were broken in and vandalized extensively at some point after mid-April, thus destroying food and first-aid supplies, as noted by Jon Krakauer. Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote: ""I am exposed continually to what I will call the 'McCandless Phenomenon.' People, nearly always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent ... When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament ... Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide."" Judith Kleinfeld wrote in the Anchorage Daily News that ""many Alaskans react with rage to his stupidity. You'd have to be a complete idiot, they say, to die of starvation in summer 20 miles off the Park's Highway.""[12] Thank you very much, but making a martyr out of a moron is just too much.",good movie about idiot,this is really good movie unfortunately i could not remove myself fact that main character was complete moron first all contrary what people feel dropping out society is lazy b s way rebelling against corporate society never achieves anything but self fulfilled prophecy here is what native alaskans felt about this fool general krakauers book made mccandless heroic figure many unlike krakauer many readers his book who have largely sympathetic view mccandless some alaskans have negative views both mccandless those who romanticize his fate mccandless was unaware that hand operated tram crossed river quarter mile stampede trail while nearby shelter was stocked with emergency supplies as described krakauers book however three nearby cabins were broken vandalized extensively at some point after mid april thus destroying food first aid supplies as noted by jon krakauer alaskan park ranger peter christian wrote i am exposed continually what i will call mccandless phenomenon people nearly always young men come alaska challenge themselves against unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience access possibility rescue are practically nonexistent when you consider mccandless my perspective you quickly see that what he did wasnt even particularly daring just stupid tragic inconsiderate first off he spent very little time learning how actually live wild he arrived at stampede trail without even map area if he had good map he could have walked out his predicament essentially chris mccandless committed suicide judith kleinfeld wrote anchorage daily news that many alaskans react with rage his stupidity youd have be complete idiot they say die starvation summer 20 miles off parks highway thank you very much but making martyr out moron is just too much,0.496818181818182,0.0004381887052341561,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.3}"
1.0,Truly awful,"Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. This film is in the IMDb top 250? How on earth did that happen?I wont even dignify a breakdown of the story. All you need to know is that the main character dies. From his own stupidity. From his own stubourness. And I felt absolutely nothing for him. Worse than that, I was happy that the arrogant, selfish little prick got exactly what he deserved. Inside I laughed a little and I am sure that is not what the director was going for.He put his family through hell for nothing other than selfishness. There is an attempt to blame this/justify it on his parents behaviour - hey Sherlock, parents are not perfect. And yours seemed pretty good, they provided for you, gave you a good home and brought you up to the extent that you had the whole world in the palm of your hand. But you threw it away because you were a grade A douche.What makes me really angry and confused is that this piece of crap is so unlikeable and the choices he made so stupid but Penn has crafted a film that would have you believe he is a hero. There is no objectivity in this at all - he was a brave young soul for doing what he did.

9.0,*The Hearts Search For True Heart*,"I agree with many others who have said that the main character makes some bad decisions (And you haven't?), and I agree that the film's story is far from the greatest story that has ever been made into a film. However, the story here is an important one that has a lot to say about being human. The story itself is certainly not at all an easy one to tell through the cinematic medium. Nonetheless, I really do think Sean Penn has captured this story nearly as well as it possibly could have been told on film, and that in itself is a stunning accomplishment. This story is so real, so human, that it reaches out and has obviously grabbed a ton of peoples hearts, including mine. The scenes themselves give off a very authentic feeling, even where some parts are somewhat rushed through for the betterment of the whole story, it ends up working well in full scope. Many of the scenes are extremely intimate, including the scene where Hirsch looks directly into the camera to increase this very aspect I feel. I know a lot of people have criticized this part, and I agree in most films it would have no place whatsoever, but here it is a very daring and effective decision by Penn in my opinion. Much of the film displays a vast amount of scenic beauty, and the scenes at slab city are nothing short of 'classic'.To me, the important thing to take from the film is not why Chris decided to leave his parents and society. Nor do I think anyone can in their right mind criticize this decision he made. That is pointless. The fact is that it was his choice, whatever his accumulative reasons may have been is beside the point. The value here is in what he learns from the experience, and the incredible way in which he and Sean Penn have now shared that message with the rest of the world.Eddie Vedders music was obviously the perfect choice for this film, as it sways with emotional depth and helps to carry the films authentic feel. There are many great acting performances here as well, none better than Catherine Keener's brilliant delivery of grace and genuine heart.The story here ventures into the territory that drives all human experience. The search for authentic heart that all people, knowingly or not search for.The heart searches for heart, only to find itself treading in a sea of broken hearts, all cut from the same Divine Cloth.

2.0,"Okay, what's good about this movie?","The lovely scenery. That's it.This is Sean Penn's valentine to a dead, spoiled rich boy-brat's pretensions. Nothing more. McCandless was a cold hearted, selfish creature who seems to have thought that everything should be all about his wants and needs. He whined about how sick our twisted society was and made no attempt to correct anything. He simply scooted off into the back country, where he traveled about, got beaten up, and finally died a needless, useless death.The one person I found interesting was the railroad bull. Undoubtedly, we were meant to see him as a violent, savage support for the evil old society That Poor Chrissy so righteously despises. I've worked on a railroad and the bulls know what they're up against: many of these freeloaders are not the cheery, story telling hobos of yor-- many are ruthless professional criminals who will kill somebody for five bucks. The bull doesn't necessarily enjoy what he does but he does it because it must be done to protect the railroad, us (think of the merchandise you buy that travels by train,) himself and yes, idiots like Hirsch's McCandless, who never think of how dangerous riding the rails can be.And in the end, the movie McCandless' journey ended as did the odyssey of the real one-- a miserable, pointless death in the middle of nowhere. One thing that amuses me is how Chris' worshipers like to blather about how, unlike so many of us, he wasn't content with the 9-5 routine in our allegedly sick society, he lived his life the way he wanted, the way it was meant to be lived, etc., as if the path he took is the only authentic one. And of course, the ones who rant the loudest against our technological society in the process do so while using a computer to post on the Internet.

10.0,Exceptional in every possible way,"Sean Penn's Into the Wild is beautiful, staggering, thoughtful, a labor of love made by a filmmaker with real passion for the story he set out to tell. Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as ""if you only see one film this year"" and goes beyond the very notion of ""Oscar-worthy"". If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penn's masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: it's a life experience.A rebel at heart, Penn clearly identifies, at least on a few levels, with the film's unconventional protagonist, a bright young boy named Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), whose astounding true story was first recounted in Jon Krakauer's book which gives the picture its title. Christopher had it all: loving parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister (Jena Malone), excellent grades and a most promising future. Then, one fine day the 20-year old college graduate decided that wasn't really what he wanted, took his law school fund and disappeared, setting out for a journey to the heart of America. ""I'm going into the wild"" the self-renamed Alex Supertramp wrote in his journal, and though he occasionally ran into people (Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and others) he would connect with in a deeper way, that's where he really belonged: away from civilization, just him, his elementary tools and the pure, untarnished nature surrounding him.Christopher's journey, which is carried out with just the basic resources one needs to survive (no cell phone or other gadgets), is a modern odyssey of sorts, a quest for something that was lost forever and won't be found in the near future. In a world like ours, where technology rules all, a choice like Christopher's would be met with disbelief and probably derision. That only heightens the intensity of the character's message, which is also what the director aims to tell us: we need to rediscover ourselves before it's too late. It doesn't matter whether we are young or old, as the protagonist touchingly teaches an elderly man (Hal Holbrook, the only cast-member to be nominated for an Oscar), the important thing is we give it a serious try.To simply call this a film isn't enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penn's soulful direction, Hirsch's painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedder's elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something that's almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it.Into the Wild isn't an ""easy"" film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many ""issue movies"" try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isn't merely a motion picture: it is art, life, freedom and nature, all together in a mesmerizing piece of visual poetry.",exceptional every possible way,sean penns into wild is beautiful staggering thoughtful labor love made by filmmaker with real passion story he set out tell like terrence malick picture into wild transcends any conception such as if you only see one film this year goes beyond very notion oscar worthy if one really has say something subject then into wild should have shared best picture award with no country old men but that kind thinking is besides point because penns masterpiece is more than movie or work art that matter its life experience rebel at heart penn clearly identifies at least few levels with films unconventional protagonist bright young boy named christopher mccandless emile hirsch whose astounding true story was first recounted jon krakauers book which gives picture its title christopher had it all loving parents william hurt marcia gay harden sister jena malone excellent grades most promising future then one fine day 20 year old college graduate decided that wasnt really what he wanted took his law school fund disappeared setting out journey heart america im going into wild self renamed alex supertramp wrote his journal though he occasionally ran into people catherine keener vince vaughn others he would connect with deeper way thats where he really belonged away civilization just him his elementary tools pure untarnished nature surrounding him christophers journey which is carried out with just basic resources one needs survive no cell phone or other gadgets is modern odyssey sorts quest something that was lost forever wont be found near future world like ours where technology rules all choice like christophers would be met with disbelief probably derision that only heightens intensity characters message which is also what director aims tell us we need rediscover ourselves before its too late it doesnt matter whether we are young or old as protagonist touchingly teaches elderly man hal holbrook only cast member be nominated oscar important thing is we give it serious try simply call this film isnt enough one most amazing combinations efforts history movie making story penns soulful direction hirschs painfully real performance will he ever be this good again eddie vedders elegiac songs essential soundtrack any true film lover merge into something thats almost too powerful describe words you have see it believe it into wild isnt easy film it will leave you very affected possibly devastated but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing genuine masterwork it will ignite real thoughts about life instead phony reflections so many issue movies try induce it will hit gut heart mind equal measure once initial wave emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded into wild does this because it isnt merely motion picture it is art life freedom nature all together mesmerizing piece visual poetry,0.5222789115646257,0.20851886209029055,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,In search of time not found.,"I've never seen a movie quite like this one, not an American movie at any rate. The one that comes closest, maybe, is ""Easy Rider,"" but that one was full of plot points and ambition, raggedy though they turned out. ""Into the Wild"" is more like an assemblage of episodes from a self-made movie, put together with the help of some family friends who happen to be professional actors.Emile Hirsch is the non-fictional Chris McCandless who gives away everything he owns, takes to the road, and winds up owning nothing in the Alaskan wilderness, not even the opportunity to savor the emotional fulfillment of being completely and utterly alone.Hirsch isn't bad either. He is transformed from chubby and cheerful at the start to thin and desperate by the end. I would guess the film sticks pretty closely to its origins, which I think I remember reading in The New Yorker years ago.The narration is based on Chris's sister's memories and on Chris's own journal but narrations can be misleading or sometimes plain wrong. It seems to be all the fault of McCandless's bickering parents. It was they who drove him to these peregrinations. Well -- that's kind of an easy way out. It provides a satisfying explanation for a story that is likely to be otherwise unexplainable, at least until we know more about neurology. It's always easy to find a trigger for behavior in our past experiences. Psychoanalysis rode that horse for generations. In reality I suspect that strangeness in people is partly a given at birth, and the explanations are post hoc and fitted to the cultural climate. It's tough enough being the parent of an odd child without being blamed for every odd thing he does.Where was I? I think I started out for the Sea of Cortez and found myself, like Chris, in the North Woods.The photography is sometimes stunning, often appealing, and sometimes as idiosyncratic as Ray Bolger's dance in ""The Wizard of Oz."" Step motion, slow motion, negative shots, all are employed but not, thank God, to the point of nausea. The whole film is leisurely, moving back and forth from Chris's encounters at home and on the road, to the Magic Bus he lives in at the top of the world.Good actors. Nobody in the movie flubs it. Catherine Keener and William Hurt are exceptional performers but they have little to do on screen. Hurt does get a chance to register some convincing abject anguish at the end. Hal Holbrook, now an older man, has never been quite as good as he is here. A home run for Holbrook.Does the movie have a point? Well, it certainly tries to impose one on the narrative, something along the lines of spiritual fulfillment is worth any price, even life itself. Hirsch dies with an open smile on his face, gazing at opalescent clouds. (If I remember correctly, the real Chris assumed his absence would be noticed and was waiting for an expected helicopter rescue.) The fuzzy points I would take away don't include our need for others in any but a mechanical sense. (We need others to make our shoes and guns.) There have been successful hermits before. I certainly wouldn't conclude from this story that nature is cruel because it isn't. It's just indifferent.
