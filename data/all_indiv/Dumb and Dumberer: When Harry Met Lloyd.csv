2.0,I only saw this in order to see as many of IMDB's Bottom 100 as possible....and it IS annoying!,"I have a weird obsession....to see all of IMDB's Bottom 100---the one hundred lowest rated major release films of all time. Unfortunately, I'll probably never complete the list, as a couple of the remaining films are Turkish and one is German...and it's highly unlikely they'll bother captioning films hated this much by the audiences. For me, ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd"" is the 95th film I've seen...a dubious accomplishment, I know.The original ""Dumb and Dumber"" was a silly but mildly enjoyable film (I just rewatched it). And, the studio came up with a brilliant idea....since they couldn't get Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey for a sequel (or, more likely they didn't want to PAY them for a sequel), they made a prequel with unknown actors playing the leads. The fans were NOT amused.The story begins long before ""Dumb and Dumber"" and near the very beginning, Harry and Lloyd* bump into each other for the first time. Soon they are buddies and soon the pair are assigned to the school's new fake special needs class. This is because the evil principal (Eugene Levy....who is just too good for films like this) wants to create a fake special needs class to get additional funding...which he can embezzle. Instead of a real classroom, it's in a shed and the lunch lady is in charge....and soon Harry and Lloyd sign up several other students for the class. Will the Principal be able to get away with this case of fraud? So is any of this funny? Not especially. Mostly it's annoying and occasionally offensive (such as how they deal with mental disabilities as well as the MANY sexist jokes). This isn't too surprising since it is on the list AND the original folks who made the film had nothing to do with this project. However, it's not among the very worst films I've seen and I think it made the list mostly because compared to the original film it was an unfunny abomination. *FYI, the actors appear to be about 25...a bit old for high school. But a lot of the 'students' in the movie appear to be quite old as well.",i only saw this order see as many imdbs bottom 100 as possible it is annoying,i have weird obsession see all imdbs bottom 100 one hundred lowest rated major release films all time unfortunately ill probably never complete list as couple remaining films are turkish one is german its highly unlikely theyll bother captioning films hated this much by audiences me dumb dumberer when harry met lloyd is 95th film ive seen dubious accomplishment i know original dumb dumber was silly but mildly enjoyable film i just rewatched it studio came up with brilliant idea since they couldnt get jeff daniels jim carrey sequel or more likely they didnt want pay them sequel they made prequel with unknown actors playing leads fans were not amused story begins long before dumb dumber near very beginning harry lloyd bump into each other first time soon they are buddies soon pair are assigned schools new fake special needs class this is because evil principal eugene levy who is just too good films like this wants create fake special needs class get additional funding which he can embezzle instead real classroom its shed lunch lady is charge soon harry lloyd sign up several other students class will principal be able get away with this case fraud so is any this funny not especially mostly its annoying occasionally offensive such as how they deal with mental disabilities as well as many sexist jokes this isnt too surprising since it is list original folks who made film had nothing do with this project however its not among very worst films ive seen i think it made list mostly because compared original film it was unfunny abomination fyi actors appear be about 25 bit old high school but lot students movie appear be quite old as well,0.5712173320506654,-0.0037379749879749933,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.29}"
,Not as bad as everyone says!,"There's a number of jokes that are funny in this movie and I don't know why people criticize it. I mean like what the heck did you expect a masterpiece? For what it was the film is at least loyal to the characters who are both stupid and you don't know who's stupider. This is way better than that terrible sequel made last year, where all the jokes were based on how gross it could be. I never liked the idea of prequels but this film I think did it fine. The only thing I think would of been a wiser idea is had Harry take Lloyd's role of being the one to tell him what to do. I mean Harry is a leader in the original but here he is more of like a sidekick. I really liked the scene, ""There's Sh.t everywhere!"" The only things I wish they changed were Harry and Lloyd's roles and also maybe add a funnier climax but it's overall alright! I can't believe people hate this but the sequel made last year is rated higher! I think these rating should be switched!

6.0,"Actually not that bad, Far better than the sequel","People judge this movie too harshly because it's a prequel to a beloved movie. Yes, the original Dumb & Dumber is far better. Of course it is. No one expected this movie to surpass the original. I honestly think they did a pretty good job. A good number of jokes landed for me and the actors did a great job of portraying what I think a young Harry and Lloyd would act like. They do a better job playing the characters and the actual same actors did in the sequel ""Dumb and Dumber To"". This movie is way better than that one in my opinion.Overall, not nearly as bad as people say and deserves more credit. 6/10.",actually not that bad far better than sequel,people judge this movie too harshly because its prequel beloved movie yes original dumb dumber is far better course it is no one expected this movie surpass original i honestly think they did pretty good job good number jokes landed me actors did great job portraying what i think young harry lloyd would act like they do better job playing characters actual same actors did sequel dumb dumber this movie is way better than that one my opinion overall not nearly as bad as people say deserves more credit 6 10,0.5772435897435897,0.2269230769230769,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.1, 'Fear': 0.41}"
1.0,Pathetic cash in on Hilarious original,"Was this movie necessary!? This is a truly terrible film, woefully unfunny to the extreme. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were excellent in the first film and in a different league to the two actors in the roles as the young Harry and Lloyd (the guy cast as Lloyd does look like Carrey, except for the blue eyes). If there was ever going to be another film about these two characters it should have been a sequel starring the original pairing, instead we get this stinker. Dumb and Dumber hardly had an Oscar winning story line but gave us some great characters and a hatful of ball bouncingly funny gags, in the 'prequel' the weak story collapses under the weight of even weaker jokes! So uninspired is this movie that there are even rehashes of jokes from the original, just done slightly differently but in a totally inept manner. Dumb and Dumber is a classic, this is a pile of steaming doggy doo doo's.

Also I found this movie absolutely not funny but it's simply insulting and disgusting instead. You must protect your kids from seeing it.

3.0,THE WORST PREQUEL...,"...or how to make a comedy without a laugh?When I first heard that there's a sequel to Dumb and Dumber I was ecstatic since this was the best comedy in ninenties and certainly one of the best comedies ever. But after seeing opening credits (No Jim & Jeff), I was a little sceptical. Never mind, it still can be good...Erghh, wrong. The movie was getting worse and worse. The leading characters were shown like a couple of retards (very unlikable, since in original there aren't THAT slow), who were just trying to imitate Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and failed miserably. Lack of charm, i guess. But the main fault goes to script writer who provides a lot of already seen jokes as the rest of the producers of this crap.I agree, it would be nearly impossible to beat the original version, since it was full of original black humor, but hey, at least they could try harder. Despite that movie sucked, it has some moments...but since i can't remember any if them, i couldn't rate it higher than3 out of 10.",worst prequel,or how make comedy without laugh when i first heard that theres sequel dumb dumber i was ecstatic since this was best comedy ninenties certainly one best comedies ever but after seeing opening credits no jim jeff i was little sceptical never mind it still can be good erghh wrong movie was getting worse worse leading characters were shown like couple retards very unlikable since original there arent that slow who were just trying imitate jim carrey jeff daniels failed miserably lack charm i guess but main fault goes script writer who provides lot already seen jokes as rest producers this crap i agree it would be nearly impossible beat original version since it was full original black humor but hey at least they could try harder despite that movie sucked it has some moments but since i cant remember any if them i couldnt rate it higher than3 out 10,0.556122448979592,-0.07285289115646258,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"
3.0,The title says it all...,"Let's face it, if you went into a restaurant and ordered a sh*t sandwich and got precisely that, could you honestly complain about what you got?Dumb and Dumberer is precisely that. The title sums it up and you really shouldn't expect anything other than rubbish when you sit down to watch it.That said, I am surprised to see it in the bottom 100 of IMDb's lists. It is bad, but I'm sure there are many films far above it that deserve its place at the bottom much, much more.Dumb and Dumberer could never hope to compete with its predecessor but its no worse really than any other teen-comedy-high-school nonsense. If the original movie had not been made, then this one wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the bad press it has. But, alas, it was not to be, and so this film will slip into obscurity like many ill-conceived sequels, destined to be forgotten, or talked about with ill-disguised scorn when reminiscing over the original movie.The best way to watch this film (if you have to at all) is to try and forget the characters Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels made their own, and view it as if that first film had never happened. Also, console yourself whilst watching that there are a few bloopers tacked onto the end that are the comedic highlight of this unfunny movie, although its really not worth watching the film just for them. You might then get some enjoyment out of an otherwise bland film.In summary then, its bad but not really deserving a place in the worst 100 of IMDb.",title says it all,lets face it if you went into restaurant ordered sh t sandwich got precisely that could you honestly complain about what you got dumb dumberer is precisely that title sums it up you really shouldnt expect anything other than rubbish when you sit down watch it that said i am surprised see it bottom 100 imdbs lists it is bad but im sure there are many films far above it that deserve its place at bottom much much more dumb dumberer could never hope compete with its predecessor but its no worse really than any other teen comedy high school nonsense if original movie had not been made then this one wouldnt have gotten anywhere near bad press it has but alas it was not be so this film will slip into obscurity like many ill conceived sequels destined be forgotten or talked about with ill disguised scorn when reminiscing over original movie best way watch this film if you have at all is try forget characters jim carrey jeff daniels made their own view it as if that first film had never happened also console yourself whilst watching that there are few bloopers tacked onto end that are comedic highlight this unfunny movie although its really not worth watching film just them you might then get some enjoyment out otherwise bland film summary then its bad but not really deserving place worst 100 imdb,0.5901201201201202,0.015885885885885916,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"

2.0,Dumb as Can Possibly Be,"This movie flat out sucks. There's no other, smart guy way to put it. Its horrible. Its the worst prequel I've ever seen, the jokes are pure, raw slapstick in it's lowest possible form, and the two leads may look like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, but there's no way in hell they could pull it off like they did in 1994. Also, if you're going to make a prequel, set in 1986, use stuff in 1986. We see new dollar bills and the most fatal flaw is the song ""Ice Ice Baby"" by Vanilla Ice. The song came out in 1990 and this is set in 1986. Sense? Nada. This movie was clearly rushed, not thought over properly, and serves no purpose.Lets begin with the cover for the DVD. If you closely at Lloyds tooth it is clear that the left corner is just drawn with Sharpie marker or some dry erase marker to look as if it was missing. Nothing says a movie is worse than when the cover doesn't even look believable. A poor entrance to a poor movie. Fits perfectly.Before Harry and Lloyd where the best of dumb buddies, they were in high school struggling to make the grade. Now we get to the moment they first met by bumping heads. Harry was homeschooled and is now attending regular school. Upon meeting Lloyd whom gives him a half assed tour of the school, they now become the best of friends and are inseparable. After a class opens called ""The Special Needs"" class, Harry and Lloyd are asked to get people to attend. A good girl Jessica finds out why the lunch lady would be teaching a class and she soon discovers that the principal and the teacher for the fake Specials class are stealing money from the school and it's now up to Harry, Lloyd, and Jessica to stop them.Since the movie is supposed to be focused on the stupid characters of Harry and Lloyd, I shouldn't say this, but need to. It gets incredibly aggravating because the stupidity of the characters makes the movie move in a slow pace and even though its a mere 86 minutes it feels way longer. Harry and Lloyd are portrayed as stupid beyond belief. There's no way anyone in the world could be this stupid and not be mentally challenged. Its an insult.I too find it absolutely hilarious that the cameo appearance by Bob Saget is funnier than the two leads in the movie. Bob Saget's cameo is nowhere near as funny to earn this movie an extra star, but its damn sure funny to earn it probably the most memorable thing about this movie. Julia Duffy doesn't do much in the movie, but I remember her as Mrs. Hayfer in Drake & Josh. Those will be the only two people who I cite as a ""decent job done"" in this movie. Eugene Levy is awful in this movie and so are the actors who portray Harry and Lloyd. Luis Guzmán also does a poor job in this as well.I thought I'd approach this film with an open mind and have a decent attitude and relate it to something me and my friend do. I like a lot of stupid movies like Bio-Dome, but this just completely blew my mind. From the DVD menu gags to the ""Dont press this button"" joke on there as well I knew this movie was going to be no more than two stars if they found burping and farting to be the most hilarious joke on the planet. Sure enough I was right.

1.0,I feel dumberer for having watched it.,"So my roommate borrowed ""Dumb And Dumberer"".God only knows why.Anyway, he puts it in the machine and shortly afterward leaves the room to take a phone call.He owes that caller more than he knows.See, as I hadn't paid any money for it, nor even gotten my butt up off the couch to load the disc, I had little investment in it. Thusly I figured it wouldn't take much to meet my relatively low expectations for it. After all, the first one was pretty funny, right?Before I continue, it should be noted that this movie had none of the original cast members, writers, directors, etc from the first film.No one, at least, worth noting.Now, back to the story. Where the first movie had laughs galore (most of them cheap lowbrow humor, but hey, if I want Shakespeare, I'll read Shakespeare...) this movie had a sprinkling of ""That's kinda funny..."" and ""Was that funny? I can't tell anymore..."" moments.The most telling thing I can say about this movie is that I DIDN'T FINISH IT. Nay, I COULDN'T finish it.A friend of mine that had the misfortune of being in the room with me at the time said it best when he said: ""At one point I laughed at how painfully unfunny it was and I realized that it (the movie) had pulled me down to it's level.""Of course he also said: ""Another reason dumb and dumbrererererrer sucked is that both guys were trying to cop Betty White's ""Rose"" character from the Golden Girls but neither of them possesses her panache or supple buttocks.""Verily, it is a thing of evil.Having said that, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. I would have to give some thought to exactly which movie holds that dishonor. ""Batman and Robin"" is pretty close. But no, I've actually finished worse movies than this. Thing is, in those movies I held out hope that they would get better before the end. With Dumb and Dumberer, there was no such hope. In fact, there was utterly no hope at all.I did get a chuckle from a couple moments though. Like when the two titular characters walk down the school hallway with their Special Ed class to the theme from the A-Team, and... well, that's it actually.Oh yeah, Mimi Rogers made out with a little hottie named Rachel Nichols.The most notable thing about Nichols, other than her being very attractive, is that she's in the new Bruce Campbell film ""The Woods"" which is currently in post production.Apart from that ""Dumb and Dumberer"" can be summed up by the fact that I actually got up off my couch to remove this ultra-boring, ultra-unfunny piece of cinematic spam from the DVD player.PS: I did put it back in to check the not-so 'Special Features', but I did not find the apology I was looking for.Maybe it's an 'Easter Egg'.I don't recommend checking yourselves, but if someone finds it, please let me know.

2.0,The Most Unnecessary Movie Of 2003,"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd is really just a dumb comedy, the only problem is that it isn't funny. It's the first day of high school and Harry, who previously has been home schooled by his mother, needs someone to show him the ropes. Lloyd, who lives in the school's basement with his adoptive dad/school custodian Ray, turns out to be just the guy. They unknowingly fall into the web of the corrupt Principal Collins and his girlfriend, head lunch lady Ms. Heller, who want them to be the first students in a phony ""special needs"" class in order to bilk $100,000 in grant money for themselves. Harry and Lloyd go out to look for more students for this new class, they catch the attention of Jessica Matthews, a hard-hitting reporter for the school's newspaper, who suspects foul play. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution is very bad. This has to be the most pointless film of 2003 and one of the least funniest as well. Most of the jokes just fall flat and apparently the filmmakers weren't trying at all. I can see now why Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels backed out of this one. They are replaced by Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. Derek and Eric both play their roles dumb, they just try to hard most of the time and aren't funny. Eugene Levy is embarrassingly bad and this has to be his worst film ever. Mimi Roger's role is small but its nice to see her on screen. She is also one of the few saving graces in this film. The rest of the cast is mostly unfunny except for Bob Saget who does have some funny moments. Troy Miller does a poor job of directing and writing as he didn't seem to really put a lot effort in. People are defending this film, saying that you can't take every film seriously. I wasn't taking this film seriously and it still wasn't very funny. There might had been a laugh here or there but that's it. The original was fine and didn't need a prequel to explain what happened before and this film just ruins the original. The running time is also a good thing as its only 82 minutes long though sometimes it feels longer. Is this film better then the original? No, not even close and this comedy should be forgotten. In the end, this film is not worth the time or money to watch and its better if you just skip this. Rating 3.3/10, rent the original instead.",most unnecessary movie 2003,dumb dumberer when harry met lloyd is really just dumb comedy only problem is that it isnt funny its first day high school harry who previously has been home schooled by his mother needs someone show him ropes lloyd who lives schools basement with his adoptive dad school custodian ray turns out be just guy they unknowingly fall into web corrupt principal collins his girlfriend head lunch lady ms heller who want them be first students phony special needs class order bilk 100 000 grant money themselves harry lloyd go out look more students this new class they catch attention jessica matthews hard hitting reporter schools newspaper who suspects foul play plot sounds like it has some potential but execution is very bad this has be most pointless film 2003 one least funniest as well most jokes just fall flat apparently filmmakers werent trying at all i can see now why jim carrey jeff daniels backed out this one they are replaced by eric christian olsen derek richardson derek eric both play their roles dumb they just try hard most time arent funny eugene levy is embarrassingly bad this has be his worst film ever mimi rogers role is small but its nice see her screen she is also one few saving graces this film rest cast is mostly unfunny except bob saget who does have some funny moments troy miller does poor job directing writing as he didnt seem really put lot effort people are defending this film saying that you cant take every film seriously i wasnt taking this film seriously it still wasnt very funny there might had been laugh here or there but thats it original was fine didnt need prequel explain what happened before this film just ruins original running time is also good thing as its only 82 minutes long though sometimes it feels longer is this film better then original no not even close this comedy should be forgotten end this film is not worth time or money watch its better if you just skip this rating 3 3 10 rent original instead,0.5652649510982846,0.04386123136123137,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"

3.0,So I think by now the title officially refers to the writer and the director and not anyone in the movie itself.,"It's hard to believe that it's actually been almost a decade since the first Dumb and Dumber, which was deservedly a smash hit, was released on the unsuspecting populace. I can see it now. I was in tenth grade, and I still remember ditching class in beautiful Irvine, California to ride my bicycle over to Fashion Island in Newport Beach so my friend and I could steal bubble gum from one of the ritzy drugstores and then go see this movie, which we must have seen in the theaters half a dozen times or so. Where we got the money I've been trying to remember for years. I'd like to start out by saying that I don't know that the prequel to the brilliant Dumb and Dumber (easily one of the most hilarious comedies to come along in decades) really deserves all of the vicious reviews that it has received from professional and amateur critics alike. It has been a popular and critical disaster from the day it was released, and while it's true that it is simply a bad, bad movie, I think that anyone claiming it to be 'absolutely THE worst movie I've EVER seen' might be exaggerating just a little bit. Or maybe I've just seen worse movies than these people. I've seen some seriously bad movies, and while Dumb and Dumberer is certainly an embarrassing flop, I've seen worse. It's better than Scary Movie 2 and 3 combined, for example. That being said, on to the crapfests. Dumb and Dumberer, since I have neither the energy nor interest to research the intentions, strikes me almost unmistakably as one of those movies that one studio makes of another studio's movie. Kind of like how Pixar just publicly insulted Disney at the same time as they ended the two companies' partnership, and Pixar promptly announced that they would be making Toy Story 3. I expect Toy Story 3 may be a disaster (if the 'threat' was serious), possibly even purposely, in order to get back at Disney. I don't know that this prequel to Dumb and Dumber was done for revenge at all, but I can't say that it's all that mysterious as to why the original cast and crew had little to nothing to do with it.That being said, I have to say that I'm impressed with the actors they found to play the younger Harry and Lloyd, especially Lloyd, because this guy, without the bowl-cut and the chipped tooth, looks NOTHING like Jim Carrey's Lloyd, but in the movie he's the spitting image. This is one of the reasons that I think the movie deserves at least minor respect. At least the casting director was on the ball. Sadly, it's all downhill from there. I have to admit that I was pretty happy to see Bob Saget acting again. Granted, I barely remember him in Full House at all and I saw his one spoken line in Half Baked as the official end of his acting career, but I loved his cheesy jokes on America's Funniest Home Videos (the ORIGINAL show) so much that seeing him on screen again was almost like a trip back to my childhood.And then Harry had a little incident involving chocolate, and I started to squirm in my seat, as I'm sure many other people started to do, given the reviews I've read. It is expected that some memorable scene from the original film would be almost duplicated in a sequel like this, but Harry getting diarrhea in the original movie was funny because it was there for a reason. Lloyd put massive amounts of laxative in Harry's tea to get revenge on him for dating the girl that he was after. Crude, yes, but still funny. In this movie, Harry goes nuts with the chocolate in the bathroom and then Jessica's poor dad (Bob Saget) comes in and screams a numbing stream of profanity about there being feces all over his bathroom. Not only is this supposed to be funny, but there is so much stock put into this idea that it's duplicated again later in the film. It's sad that a comedy as smashing and brilliant as Dumb and Dumber has been followed up by such a stupid, stupid film. While I admit that you can hardly expect for them to have created something as great as Dumb and Dumber again, I really didn't think that they could have come up with something THIS bad. I mean, just the name itself should have inspired some better ideas for the movie. Sadly, it seems that the powers that be were more interested in throwing a sequel out there than they were in actually making it deserve its title. And when a movie isn't good enough to deserve a title like Dumb & Dumberer, it's a bad, bad sign.",so i think by now title officially refers writer director not anyone movie itself,its hard believe that its actually been almost decade since first dumb dumber which was deservedly smash hit was released unsuspecting populace i can see it now i was tenth grade i still remember ditching class beautiful irvine california ride my bicycle over fashion island newport beach so my friend i could steal bubble gum one ritzy drugstores then go see this movie which we must have seen theaters half dozen times or so where we got money ive been trying remember years id like start out by saying that i dont know that prequel brilliant dumb dumber easily one most hilarious comedies come along decades really deserves all vicious reviews that it has received professional amateur critics alike it has been popular critical disaster day it was released while its true that it is simply bad bad movie i think that anyone claiming it be absolutely worst movie ive ever seen might be exaggerating just little bit or maybe ive just seen worse movies than these people ive seen some seriously bad movies while dumb dumberer is certainly embarrassing flop ive seen worse its better than scary movie 2 3 combined example that being said crapfests dumb dumberer since i have neither energy nor interest research intentions strikes me almost unmistakably as one those movies that one studio makes another studios movie kind like how pixar just publicly insulted disney at same time as they ended two companies partnership pixar promptly announced that they would be making toy story 3 i expect toy story 3 may be disaster if threat was serious possibly even purposely order get back at disney i dont know that this prequel dumb dumber was done revenge at all but i cant say that its all that mysterious as why original cast crew had little nothing do with it that being said i have say that im impressed with actors they found play younger harry lloyd especially lloyd because this guy without bowl cut chipped tooth looks nothing like jim carreys lloyd but movie hes spitting image this is one reasons that i think movie deserves at least minor respect at least casting director was ball sadly its all downhill there i have admit that i was pretty happy see bob saget acting again granted i barely remember him full house at all i saw his one spoken line half baked as official end his acting career but i loved his cheesy jokes americas funniest home videos original show so much that seeing him screen again was almost like trip back my childhood then harry had little incident involving chocolate i started squirm my seat as im sure many other people started do given reviews ive read it is expected that some memorable scene original film would be almost duplicated sequel like this but harry getting diarrhea original movie was funny because it was there reason lloyd put massive amounts laxative harrys tea get revenge him dating girl that he was after crude yes but still funny this movie harry goes nuts with chocolate bathroom then jessicas poor dad bob saget comes screams numbing stream profanity about there being feces all over his bathroom not only is this supposed be funny but there is so much stock put into this idea that its duplicated again later film its sad that comedy as smashing brilliant as dumb dumber has been followed up by such stupid stupid film while i admit that you can hardly expect them have created something as great as dumb dumber again i really didnt think that they could have come up with something this bad i mean just name itself should have inspired some better ideas movie sadly it seems that powers that be were more interested throwing sequel out there than they were actually making it deserve its title when movie isnt good enough deserve title like dumb dumberer its bad bad sign,0.602698817622287,-0.013289601554907672,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.25}"

6.0,"Not nearly as bad as I was expecting it to be - but then again, not nearly as good as it could have been, either.","Want to hear something funny? I laughed at ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd."" In fact, at about four scenes I was rolling over in laughter. And not just me -- people in front of and behind me were roaring in laughter, too.It's not a good movie. But I have seen far worse. Yes, the movie is filmed in the distinct style of a bad movie. It has a bad script. Most of its jokes are bad. It's essentially a bad movie. But it's not awful. And when I left, I had a smile on my face, because I had expected a depressing comedy and I got a goofy, good-natured one with a few good gags and a lot of good spirit. In its essence, it is quite easy to watch and -- perhaps -- just a little bit fun.I say this not out of prior prejudice, as much as I may have enjoyed the first installment, but out of surprise, because I expected it to give a bad name to the first film, ""Dumb and Dumber"" (1994). I read all the bad reviews before going into ""Dumb and Dumberer."" I didn't expect to laugh a single minute time, and I expected it to be a pale imitation of its predecessor.I did laugh. Not much, but I did. And it's not a pale imitation of the first film--it isn't nearly as solid in direction (thanks to the absence of the Farrelly Brothers), but this is a good thing. I don't think it wanted to try to be like the first film, because it knew that it couldn't be and never would be. So it's just a sappy little 90-minute movie with a few good gags and a notably convincing portrayal of a younger Jim Carrey (or Lloyd Christmas) from Eric Christian Olsen. His face is often contorted with an arched eyebrow. To those who said he didn't look like Jim Carrey: Shame on you. He's even got the movements and physical gestures down pat.It's 1986. Lloyd (Olsen) lives with his stepfather (Luis Guzman), the local high school janitor. Rushing to catch the bus for school one day, he turns around a corner and (literally) bumps into Harry Dunne (Derek Richardson), a homeschooler whose first day of school begins on that very day. Lloyd gets his tooth chipped when they bump into each other and immediately they are best pals.As Lloyd shows Harry the ropes at school, Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) sets up a ""special needs"" program at the school as a way of cheating his way to a 100,000 dollar grant from a pay program, which -- unbeknownst to him -- is all just an FBI sting. The cafeteria cook (Chery Oteri), who is also Collins' lover, plays teacher to Harry, Lloyd and a band of other ""special"" kids. Meanwhile, Harry and Lloyd's friendship starts to blossom.You want to know the scene that had my hysterically laughing in this film? It's the most juvenile scene in the entire movie, and I know this, but it was great. Bob Saget (""Full House"") plays the uptight father of Jessica, Harry's wannabe love interest. Invited to dinner at their house, Harry accidentally spreads melted chocolate all over the bathroom wall. After leaving, Saget walks in and sees it, completely freaks out, and starts to curse up a storm. Let's just say that he thinks it is something other than chocolate covering his bathroom.I cherish ""Dumb and Dumber,"" the original, because I find its buddies lovable and its goofiness contagious. I am a big fan of the buddy movie sub genre, specifically the Odd Couple stuff. ""Dumb and Dumberer"" is not in its league. It's too childish, too crude, too immature, too plain stupid. But y'know what? It sure is a lot dumber than the first film. Perhaps even dumberer. Like I said above, after reading the negative press about this film I really expected a shameless cash-in on the original. In a way, that's what I got. But I admire this film's spirit. It knows it's nothing great. And it didn't harm me, despite all its crude humor and childish jokes. In a way, it's almost admirable because the director, Troy Miller, managed to create a film that plastered a goofy little grin on my face without disgusting me like ""Daddy Day Care"" did, a ""family"" comedy minus the laughs. This one works, in an odd sort of way. And, for once, a film title lives up to its name. This movie is certainly dumberer than the first.Note: I seem to be praising this film. I'm not. It is merely a mediocre comedy. I withhold its flaws in my review specifically because it surprised me very much and, despite being an undoubtedly bad movie, I don't necessarily find it harmful in any way, shape or form. It's a goofy little comedy with a smaller heart than the first but a heart nevertheless. I give it a bad rating because it trips more than it succeeds. But I will add a disclaimer to this review: It's not as bad as you think...and you may be surprised. This film puts a small little smile on your face.",not nearly as bad as i was expecting it be but then again not nearly as good as it could have been either,want hear something funny i laughed at dumb dumberer when harry met lloyd fact at about four scenes i was rolling over laughter not just me people front behind me were roaring laughter too its not good movie but i have seen far worse yes movie is filmed distinct style bad movie it has bad script most its jokes are bad its essentially bad movie but its not awful when i left i had smile my face because i had expected depressing comedy i got goofy good natured one with few good gags lot good spirit its essence it is quite easy watch perhaps just little bit fun i say this not out prior prejudice as much as i may have enjoyed first installment but out surprise because i expected it give bad name first film dumb dumber 1994 i read all bad reviews before going into dumb dumberer i didnt expect laugh single minute time i expected it be pale imitation its predecessor i did laugh not much but i did its not pale imitation first film it isnt nearly as solid direction thanks absence farrelly brothers but this is good thing i dont think it wanted try be like first film because it knew that it couldnt be never would be so its just sappy little 90 minute movie with few good gags notably convincing portrayal younger jim carrey or lloyd christmas eric christian olsen his face is often contorted with arched eyebrow those who said he didnt look like jim carrey shame you hes even got movements physical gestures down pat its 1986 lloyd olsen lives with his stepfather luis guzman local high school janitor rushing catch bus school one day he turns around corner literally bumps into harry dunne derek richardson homeschooler whose first day school begins that very day lloyd gets his tooth chipped when they bump into each other immediately they are best pals as lloyd shows harry ropes at school principal collins eugene levy sets up special needs program at school as way cheating his way 100 000 dollar grant pay program which unbeknownst him is all just fbi sting cafeteria cook chery oteri who is also collins lover plays teacher harry lloyd band other special kids meanwhile harry lloyds friendship starts blossom you want know scene that had my hysterically laughing this film its most juvenile scene entire movie i know this but it was great bob saget full house plays uptight father jessica harrys wannabe love interest invited dinner at their house harry accidentally spreads melted chocolate all over bathroom wall after leaving saget walks sees it completely freaks out starts curse up storm lets just say that he thinks it is something other than chocolate covering his bathroom i cherish dumb dumber original because i find its buddies lovable its goofiness contagious i am big fan buddy movie sub genre specifically odd couple stuff dumb dumberer is not its league its too childish too crude too immature too plain stupid but yknow what it sure is lot dumber than first film perhaps even dumberer like i said above after reading negative press about this film i really expected shameless cash original way thats what i got but i admire this films spirit it knows its nothing great it didnt harm me despite all its crude humor childish jokes way its almost admirable because director troy miller managed create film that plastered goofy little grin my face without disgusting me like daddy day care did family comedy minus laughs this one works odd sort way once film title lives up its name this movie is certainly dumberer than first note i seem be praising this film im not it is merely mediocre comedy i withhold its flaws my review specifically because it surprised me very much despite being undoubtedly bad movie i dont necessarily find it harmful any way shape or form its goofy little comedy with smaller heart than first but heart nevertheless i give it bad rating because it trips more than it succeeds but i will add disclaimer this review its not as bad as you think you may be surprised this film puts small little smile your face,0.48674603174603154,0.01750520426749936,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.25}"
2.0,Not even Bob Saget saying the 'S' word can save this load of crap,"Dumb and Dumberer lives up to it's title, it's dumb. This film is supposed to be a prequel to the smash comedy Dumb and Dumber with Jeff Daniels and Jim Carey. But this film can not be related to the first film, it's a total disgrace. The actors they got to play the young Harry and Lloyd look nothing like the actors and they are a lot dumber in this film, they make the grown ups Lloyd and Harry look smart! The plot is useless with an evil Principal played by Eugene Levy and his mistress the cafeteria lady planning to scam the school of money to go to an island paradise by creating a fake special needs class to get a load of cash. Wow, what a bore. The jokes, now here comes the juicy parts, are guess what...not funny! Lloyd and Harry getting brain freezes are not funny, Lloyds dream sequence is not funny, Lloyd falling in love with Harry's mom is stupid, the museum sequence, the mustard note, the meeting of the two stars... they are all stupid! There is only one funny joke and the films redeemer Bob Saget saying there is Sh** all over his bathroom walls. That got one good laugh. Dumb and Dumberer gets the big 2, and the reason it didn't get a one was because of Bob Saget. Thank you Bob, but you couldn't save this mess. Avoid at all cost and skip this film, you won't regret it.",not even bob saget saying s word can save this load crap,dumb dumberer lives up its title its dumb this film is supposed be prequel smash comedy dumb dumber with jeff daniels jim carey but this film can not be related first film its total disgrace actors they got play young harry lloyd look nothing like actors they are lot dumber this film they make grown ups lloyd harry look smart plot is useless with evil principal played by eugene levy his mistress cafeteria lady planning scam school money go island paradise by creating fake special needs class get load cash wow what bore jokes now here comes juicy parts are guess what not funny lloyd harry getting brain freezes are not funny lloyds dream sequence is not funny lloyd falling love with harrys mom is stupid museum sequence mustard note meeting two stars they are all stupid there is only one funny joke films redeemer bob saget saying there is sh all over his bathroom walls that got one good laugh dumb dumberer gets big 2 reason it didnt get one was because bob saget thank you bob but you couldnt save this mess avoid at all cost skip this film you wont regret it,0.6545414462081132,-0.13624338624338622,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.15, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.28}"
