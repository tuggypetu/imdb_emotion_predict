8,Engrossing crime drama with top notch performances.,"I saw this recently on Amazon Prime after reading glowing reviews.This is my first Malayalam language movie n also the first movie of the lead actor Fahadh Faasil.This movie definitely deserves all the accolades.Faasil gave a terrific performance n his mannerisms, his change of looks, especially the weight, is remarkable.Another amazing performance is by Vinay Forrt.The film kept the suspense throughout whether Freddy will kill or not and the twist came as a shock.The movie has an amazing cinematography.It was hard at times to read the subtitles cos the dialogues were pretty fast. Maybe a second viewing will help me more with the story n characters.The only thing I didn't like is the ending cos the fate of Freddy is ambiguous.Coincidentally i saw this one day aft viewing Brawl in Cell Block 99 n both has a lil similarity, a person is sent to a prison to kill another inmate.",engrossing crime drama with top notch performances,i saw this recently amazon prime after reading glowing reviews this is my first malayalam language movie n also first movie lead actor fahadh faasil this movie definitely deserves all accolades faasil gave terrific performance n his mannerisms his change looks especially weight is remarkable another amazing performance is by vinay forrt film kept suspense throughout whether freddy will kill or not twist came as shock movie has amazing cinematography it was hard at times read subtitles cos dialogues were pretty fast maybe second viewing will help me more with story n characters only thing i didnt like is ending cos fate freddy is ambiguous coincidentally i saw this one day aft viewing brawl cell block 99 n both has lil similarity person is sent prison kill another inmate,0.6357843137254903,0.24754901960784317,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.48, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.26}"

2,Overrated due to previous performance of the crew,"Honestly Didnt liked, Overrated due to historic performance of the crewIMDB Deleted my review, when it crossed 60 people found it useful Hence writing it againFirst of all there is an unchanged law in indian cinema, when it comes to gangsters or don, Good gangster that is Hero - should be doing, Smuggling, Murder, Illegal Import, Fight etc Bad gangster that is Villain - should be doing Weapon trade, narcotics etcWhich is the same in here, a criminal who makes his living out of smuggling is glorified, We could see the same trend when Reas, Don, all became released.Its glorofiying all the bad things which hero does, and protects its justification by putting a religious identity.By the vision of story, all the bad deeds will go away if he goes to Hajj, thats a religious concept which they tried to bring in a legal sense itself.The hero who does all the criminal activities becomes a heartthrobe of community. The story is clieched, communtiy protects him from police. Flash back - how he became like this.I heard the beemapalli incident was inspired for this story, if that all, the true story has been terribly changed for appeasment.The 12 minutes continuous shot didnt brought much attention / plus point to the movie,Nimisha sajayan is always the same face from the first movie itself., the problem is , by putting a dull face, all thinks that that the expression which can be taken seriously.We should learn from the acting of Nayan Tara, Manju Varrier, Parvathy how to act serious without smile, not putting the same face all over again.Being serious doesnt mean no expression. Eyes, Lips, and dieloague tone should justify the seriousness, but her role failed in all .Fahad didnt had much acting in this as well.

9,A realistic movie,"Even though movie starts with slow pace it gains its intensity at the end and makes the audience to stick to the movie. Powerful acting by Fahad, Nimisha, Vinay and almost everyone makes this film makes even strenthier. Cinematography and direction is excellent, kudos to Mahesh Narayanan. As I said, its a lengthy movie and Alikka is an important character but portrayal of his role is somewhat lagging in some point and at the final stage of the movie very small sequence is given to portray his actions, which I felt could have been improved.",realistic movie,even though movie starts with slow pace it gains its intensity at end makes audience stick movie powerful acting by fahad nimisha vinay almost everyone makes this film makes even strenthier cinematography direction is excellent kudos mahesh narayanan as i said its lengthy movie alikka is important character but portrayal his role is somewhat lagging some point at final stage movie very small sequence is given portray his actions which i felt could have been improved,0.6566666666666667,0.1552083333333333,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.35}"
8,An excellent feat from all involved! [+81%],"Let me start off with the (very) few issues that I had with Malik. The screenplay follows a non-linear storytelling style, which was obvious from the trailer. Now, when we get to know that the story of Ahmed Ali Sulaiman (Fahadh Faasil in stellar form) is told from the perspectives of three people through lengthy flashbacks, the structuring slightly goes for a toss. Certain scenes leave lesser impact than they were supposed to. Certain moments (not mentioning any, as they would amount to spoilers) did not affect me the way it was intended to. This was especially the case in the film's closing act. You expect a banger of an ending, but with the way the screenplay's structured, it's inevitable that it can only end in sheer sobriety.With that out of the way, let's focus on the multitude of positives. The cast is outstanding. Be it FaFa, Nimisha Sajayan, Vinay Forrt, Dileesh Pothan, Indrans, Dinesh Prabhakar, Joju George, or anyone else, you can't really complain. The technicalities are top-notch: right from the DOP Sanu Varghese's cinematography (which brilliantly captures the actors at their candid best alongside the coastal, religiously charged milieu) to Sushin Shyam's musical score charging up several sequences. The 12-minute long opening shot is truly something to behold. It's a deep-dive into the psyches of the leads and delineates the connections and power dynamics within the Sulaiman household and its immediate surroundings. Like Vetrimaaran's Vada Chennai, this is a film centred around a particular region - in this case, a couple of coastal towns - the Muslim-dominated Ramadapally and the Christian-dominated Edavathura - in the Thiruvananthapuram suburbs. Solid work on the set designs, I gotta say.Writer-director Mahesh Narayanan incorporates several aspects of the region to the film's main characters and their motivations. Sulaiman, David, Peter, and Abu start off as fishermen (with some local thuggery) and venture later into smuggling because they need the money to build a better future for their families and the communities that they live in. They aren't inherently good or terrible people. These are realistically written anti-heroes painted in multiple shades of grey. Mahesh also handles the religious sentiment aspect sensibly. Each community has its share of leaders and manipulators - some of whom are driven by personal motives. It's a long story (2h 40m) but the editing (by Mahesh himself) is crisp and keeps you engaged all through.Malik is certainly designed for the big screen and it's a shame that we have to watch it on our relatively smaller home screens. By the time the film got over, I wondered what if Mahesh had chosen to split this film into two parts (similar to Vada Chennai) to keep us pining for more. The rise of the gangster within Sulaiman, while strictly textbook, is so damn engrossing, and Fahadh continues to be such a scene-stealer!",excellent feat all involved,let me start off with very few issues that i had with malik screenplay follows non linear storytelling style which was obvious trailer now when we get know that story ahmed ali sulaiman fahadh faasil stellar form is told perspectives three people through lengthy flashbacks structuring slightly goes toss certain scenes leave lesser impact than they were supposed certain moments not mentioning any as they would amount spoilers did not affect me way it was intended this was especially case films closing act you expect banger ending but with way screenplays structured its inevitable that it can only end sheer sobriety with that out way lets focus multitude positives cast is outstanding be it fafa nimisha sajayan vinay forrt dileesh pothan indrans dinesh prabhakar joju george or anyone else you cant really complain technicalities are top notch right dop sanu vargheses cinematography which brilliantly captures actors at their candid best alongside coastal religiously charged milieu sushin shyams musical score charging up several sequences 12 minute long opening shot is truly something behold its deep dive into psyches leads delineates connections power dynamics within sulaiman household its immediate surroundings like vetrimaarans vada chennai this is film centred around particular region this case couple coastal towns muslim dominated ramadapally christian dominated edavathura thiruvananthapuram suburbs solid work set designs i gotta say writer director mahesh narayanan incorporates several aspects region films main characters their motivations sulaiman david peter abu start off as fishermen with some local thuggery venture later into smuggling because they need money build better future their families communities that they live they arent inherently good or terrible people these are realistically written anti heroes painted multiple shades grey mahesh also handles religious sentiment aspect sensibly each community has its share leaders manipulators some whom are driven by personal motives its long story 2h 40m but editing by mahesh himself is crisp keeps you engaged all through malik is certainly designed big screen its shame that we have watch it our relatively smaller home screens by time film got over i wondered what if mahesh had chosen split this film into two parts similar vada chennai keep us pining more rise gangster within sulaiman while strictly textbook is so damn engrossing fahadh continues be such scene stealer,0.42714285714285727,0.14942044350207617,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.44}"
