9.0,Oye Lucky! Lucky Rocks!,"Dibakar Banerjee's 'Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!' is one of my favourite Hindi films of recent years. A dark satirical comedy revolving around a young thief, it is amazingly enjoyable and fresh and can provide a spectacular watch for the entire family. For all the smart-alecks, Banerjee does not try to glorify theft or anything of this sort but instead makes sure the viewer does not take it seriously and just enjoys this energetic and engaging, though a somewhat slow paced film. This is the comic, albeit a bit sad, story of a thief named Lucky which follows his experiences while looking for different people to rob and his subsequent attempts to quit the 'profession'.'Lucky' is extremely Indian in its depiction, humour and heart. Banerjee skillfully captures the unique atmosphere of Delhi and its simple yet colourful lifestyle. The film is reminiscent of those classic comedies made by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and his style. It is totally realistic, and is aided by an excellent script, brilliant and witty dialogues, hilarious situations and many uplifting moments. One must note that the first portions of the film, revolving around Lucky's adolescence, are superbly portrayed. The romantic story between Lucky and Sonal, the lovely girl he falls in love with, is also extremely alluring.The film is not your run-of-the-mill masala comedy. The comedy lies in the writing and the script. It does not even have song numbers for the actors to lip-sync, and you can only hear one song playing over certain montage sequences from time to time. And which song? A famous Kishore Kumar number which was taken right from an old Hindi picture of the late 1970s (Mahesh Bhatt's Lahu Ke Do Rang, to be specific). This, along with other such aspects as the great cinematography, the editing and the settings, perfectly contributes to the film's nostalgic and simple feel which will certainly be identified with Banerjee's style of film-making in coming days.With Lucky, Abhay Deol ultimately became my favourite actor of the current generation. He is outstanding from start to finish and injects charm and energy into his character, which make it interesting and memorable. Manjot Singh is also fantastic as the young Lucky. Neetu Chandra is also likable as his love interest. Paresh Rawal plays three different characters in the movie. As funny as it sounds, the three characters have absolutely no connection in the story, and Rawal plays every role excellently, though I liked the character of the doctor the most. Richa Chadda, Archana Puran Singh and Kalpana stand out in smaller comic parts.What else can I say? Lucky is an intelligent and humorous movie. It is stylish in its own way, it is feel-good, romantic and effervescent, and for me, it is also addictive! I can watch it again and again and still be totally entertained. This is a film that really can make you feel good. Way to go, Mr. Banerjee and Mr. Deol.",oye lucky lucky rocks,dibakar banerjees oye lucky lucky oye is one my favourite hindi films recent years dark satirical comedy revolving around young thief it is amazingly enjoyable fresh can provide spectacular watch entire family all smart alecks banerjee does not try glorify theft or anything this sort but instead makes sure viewer does not take it seriously just enjoys this energetic engaging though somewhat slow paced film this is comic albeit bit sad story thief named lucky which follows his experiences while looking different people rob his subsequent attempts quit profession lucky is extremely indian its depiction humour heart banerjee skillfully captures unique atmosphere delhi its simple yet colourful lifestyle film is reminiscent those classic comedies made by hrishikesh mukherjee his style it is totally realistic is aided by excellent script brilliant witty dialogues hilarious situations many uplifting moments one must note that first portions film revolving around luckys adolescence are superbly portrayed romantic story between lucky sonal lovely girl he falls love with is also extremely alluring film is not your run mill masala comedy comedy lies writing script it does not even have song numbers actors lip sync you can only hear one song playing over certain montage sequences time time which song famous kishore kumar number which was taken right old hindi picture late 1970s mahesh bhatts lahu ke do rang be specific this along with other such aspects as great cinematography editing settings perfectly contributes films nostalgic simple feel which will certainly be identified with banerjees style film making coming days with lucky abhay deol ultimately became my favourite actor current generation he is outstanding start finish injects charm energy into his character which make it interesting memorable manjot singh is also fantastic as young lucky neetu chandra is also likable as his love interest paresh rawal plays three different characters movie as funny as it sounds three characters have absolutely no connection story rawal plays every role excellently though i liked character doctor most richa chadda archana puran singh kalpana stand out smaller comic parts what else can i say lucky is intelligent humorous movie it is stylish its own way it is feel good romantic effervescent me it is also addictive i can watch it again again still be totally entertained this is film that really can make you feel good way go mr banerjee mr deol,0.6824463118580766,0.27308123249299726,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.44, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.24}"
8.0,Ignore the Critics,"I am quite appalled at the critic's response to OLLO in India. The film has been given at best a rating of average to a complete dud. I can only imagine that the reason behind this response is the fact that there is no 'out and out' superstar in the film and hence the critics do not have to show any loyalty to the 'you can't do wrong' Khans, Kapoors or Kumars of Bollywood.I must admit I went to watch OLLO with quite low expectations given the lack of critical acclaim the film had received, despite the fact the film was directed by the very competent Dibakar Banerjee of 'Khosla ka Gholsa' fame and had an interesting ensemble cast. I can tell you that I was pleasantly surprised that the film definitely met my expectations and it proves that you can't trust the film critics in India  who practically live in the pockets of certain Bollywood stars.The problem in India now is that you have parallel cinema with your mainstream run of the mill films for the masses and artistic films for the more sophisticated pallet. Therefore the tendency for critics is now to first categorise the film in to either one of these categories and then review it on that basis. For me OLLO doesn't fall in to either one of these categories  it is just a simple tale told in a competent way  much like 'Khosla ka Ghosla'. OLLO captures the atmosphere of Delhi perfectly and the adolescent years of the main character Lucky are amazing. From thereon in OLLO becomes a simple tale of a thief who steals out of force of habit  that is the storyline in a nutshell.How the main characters interact with each other helps develop the story further and the storyline follows a natural progression of events (with some mirch masala) towards its climax. As for the performances  Abhay Deol is a natural. By far he stands head and shoulders above the rest of the star cast despite the fact that Paresh Rawal is given three clear opportunities to steal his thunder. Whilst I must admit that Abhay Deol is not blessed with typical Bollywood star looks and his screen presence isn't up there with the best of them (in saying that Shah Rukh Khan looks like a caricature with his big nose and lips) , but his honest portrayal of the characters he plays is always near perfect. The rest of the star cast is also very competent and compliment each other. Once again Dibakar Banerjee has proved that he can put together an amazingly entertaining film from a very simple storyline. He reminds me of the great Hrishikesh Mukerjee.Finally, I would like to recommend that true cinema-goers firstly ignore the trained critics of India and follow their instincts  OLLO is well and truly worth a watch.",ignore critics,i am quite appalled at critics response ollo india film has been given at best rating average complete dud i can only imagine that reason behind this response is fact that there is no out out superstar film hence critics do not have show any loyalty you cant do wrong khans kapoors or kumars bollywood i must admit i went watch ollo with quite low expectations given lack critical acclaim film had received despite fact film was directed by very competent dibakar banerjee khosla ka gholsa fame had interesting ensemble cast i can tell you that i was pleasantly surprised that film definitely met my expectations it proves that you cant trust film critics india who practically live pockets certain bollywood stars problem india now is that you have parallel cinema with your mainstream run mill films masses artistic films more sophisticated pallet therefore tendency critics is now first categorise film either one these categories then review it that basis me ollo doesnt fall either one these categories it is just simple tale told competent way much like khosla ka ghosla ollo captures atmosphere delhi perfectly adolescent years main character lucky are amazing thereon ollo becomes simple tale thief who steals out force habit that is storyline nutshell how main characters interact with each other helps develop story further storyline follows natural progression events with some mirch masala towards its climax as performances abhay deol is natural by far he stands head shoulders above rest star cast despite fact that paresh rawal is given three clear opportunities steal his thunder whilst i must admit that abhay deol is not blessed with typical bollywood star looks his screen presence isnt up there with best them saying that shah rukh khan looks like caricature with his big nose lips but his honest portrayal characters he plays is always near perfect rest star cast is also very competent compliment each other once again dibakar banerjee has proved that he can put together amazingly entertaining film very simple storyline he reminds me great hrishikesh mukerjee finally i would like recommend that true cinema goers firstly ignore trained critics india follow their instincts ollo is well truly worth watch,0.5586538461538461,0.2160381285381285,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.49}"
8.0,Relive your Delhi days!,"Simply one of the best characterization and caricature of Delhi-ites on big screen. The only other contender comes to my mind is Khosla ka Ghosla by the same director - that tells me the director is very familiar with Delhi and its lingo, culture, Punjabi-Hariyani laced Hindi! If you have ever lived in Delhi, you can relate to all the characters. Period! And that in itself will make the movie a fun-watch.Abhay Deol - I consider him the most capable of Deols. I am neither a big fan of the 'action hero' Sunny or Bobby (what's his genre btw?). But this Deol knows his strength and plays by that, and experiments with new characters each time. His acting makes up for all the muscles Sunny has or all lack of dancing skills of Sunny or lack of any skills of Bobby.The young Lucky played by Manjot is an absolute delight. Paresh Rawal is adequate, somehow I feel a Boman Irani could have been a better fit. I missed Ranvir Shorey or a Deepak Dobriyal in the movie, these guys are so Delhi-ish that you can create a character for them in such a movie.A word about music:... I think Dibakar Banerjee has a good ear for the Funjabi music. Like 'Chak de phatte' from KKG, this movie has few tracks, which are just fun Punjabi-Hiphop-Techno tracks! Sorry, I haven't checked the music credits yet, but the SuperChor is a cool gangsta-rap style track, while Jugni and Oye Lucky have nice raw Punjabi touch with some modern instrumentation. I would hate to call them Bhangraa, because they are a bit different. Although none of the songs are of 'Chak De Phatte' caliber, but are more than adequate.Overall, a fun movie to watch - as long as you can follow the Delhi-sense-of-humor!I still give it 8/10 because the script loses pace somewhat towards 3/4th of the movie. It should have been an out and out comedy like the way it started and ended.",relive your delhi days,simply one best characterization caricature delhi ites big screen only other contender comes my mind is khosla ka ghosla by same director that tells me director is very familiar with delhi its lingo culture punjabi hariyani laced hindi if you have ever lived delhi you can relate all characters period that itself will make movie fun watch abhay deol i consider him most capable deols i am neither big fan action hero sunny or bobby whats his genre btw but this deol knows his strength plays by that experiments with new characters each time his acting makes up all muscles sunny has or all lack dancing skills sunny or lack any skills bobby young lucky played by manjot is absolute delight paresh rawal is adequate somehow i feel boman irani could have been better fit i missed ranvir shorey or deepak dobriyal movie these guys are so delhi ish that you can create character them such movie word about music i think dibakar banerjee has good ear funjabi music like chak de phatte kkg this movie has few tracks which are just fun punjabi hiphop techno tracks sorry i havent checked music credits yet but superchor is cool gangsta rap style track while jugni oye lucky have nice raw punjabi touch with some modern instrumentation i would hate call them bhangraa because they are bit different although none songs are chak de phatte caliber but are more than adequate overall fun movie watch as long as you can follow delhi sense humor i still give it 8 10 because script loses pace somewhat towards 3 4th movie it should have been out out comedy like way it started ended,0.43964631859368697,0.15793230891915103,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.25, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,Awesome Funjabi movie,"If Khosla ka Glosla was good then this one is excellent.Direction of Dibakar is perfect and he really tried hard to cover the areas like Tilak Nagar, Defence Colony, Rajouri Garden, Rohini, etc. As a delhite I must say he covers the Delhi city in beautiful way. This story is a true story about a thief who steals vehicles. Movie has its comedy moments. Chemistry between Abhay and Neetu is good. All supporting cast including Paresh (in a triple role), Archnapuran, Manu, etc did a fantastic job. Lesson from the story is that 'Money is the boss' and its bigger than friendship, love, relations, etc. Neetu looks very sweet in the movie. But all credit of the movie goes to none other than Abhay Deol. I liked his few earlier flicks also like Socha na Tha and Ahista Ahista, but in this movie, he is best. Dibakar is a superb Director, he impress us again after his débutant venture (Khosla ka Ghosla). Music track is also good. Character uses the languages which delhite frequently use. Go for this, it's a must watch movie.",awesome funjabi movie,if khosla ka glosla was good then this one is excellent direction dibakar is perfect he really tried hard cover areas like tilak nagar defence colony rajouri garden rohini etc as delhite i must say he covers delhi city beautiful way this story is true story about thief who steals vehicles movie has its comedy moments chemistry between abhay neetu is good all supporting cast including paresh triple role archnapuran manu etc did fantastic job lesson story is that money is boss its bigger than friendship love relations etc neetu looks very sweet movie but all credit movie goes none other than abhay deol i liked his few earlier flicks also like socha na tha ahista ahista but this movie he is best dibakar is superb director he impress us again after his d butant venture khosla ka ghosla music track is also good character uses languages which delhite frequently use go this its must watch movie,0.6209848484848486,0.4631060606060606,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.31, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.31}"
7.0,Another act of defiance,"Dibakar Banerjee, director of the cult film(if i may say so) Khosla ka Ghosla, is back with another comedy. Unusually titled Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!, it is indeed quite different from the regular bollywood fare.True, this film isn't as good as Khosla, but it definitely has a lot of things going for it. This film is a splash of colour, and is set in Delhi, just like its predecessor. Dibakar once again succeeds in capturing the essence of this decadent city, and the old-world charm it carries.The film has its special moments, like the scene where lucky meets the card-seller girl. The innocence and the humanism is not lost, and one can almost feel oneself in the midst of the action.Paresh Rawal plays three characters, analogous to Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove, and does a fine job. Although his character of Dr. Handa was a little too absolute-evil types, the others showed shades of gray, and were executed well by Rawal.The dialogue is witty and funny, and resembles elements of the same in Pulp Fiction, one is inclined to think.The film does lose its way in the second half (the entire vacation episode), the story becomes a bit of a drag, and the ending carries no surprises, but as a whole, the film does well to keep its spectators glued to the screen.However, i must say, that most of the shortcomings of the film come to light only when it is compared to global standards. If one is talking about bollywood, and the trash it churns out regularly( Dostana, Yuvvraaj), then this film is truly light years ahead in every possible department.Its a sad truth in Bollywood, that talent dies a poor man. The ones with absolute power in the industry (Amitabh Bacchan, SRK, KJo) are mortified of experimentation, of serving up anything that hasn't been dumbed down to the average IQ of an American, to the Indian audiences.I yearn for the day when independent and original thought is given credence and respect in Bollywood. Agreed, that this film isn't stuff of legend, but its a start, and a symbol of defiance. And that is why it should be given even more credit than it deserves.Stylish, Witty, and Entertaining, this film is a must watch for all the people out there who have been suffering brain damage at the hands of Karan Johar, RGV, Yash Chopra and co. I give it an 8/10, mostly due to the brilliant first half of the movie. On the whole,well done Dibakar moshai!",another act defiance,dibakar banerjee director cult film if i may say so khosla ka ghosla is back with another comedy unusually titled oye lucky lucky oye it is indeed quite different regular bollywood fare true this film isnt as good as khosla but it definitely has lot things going it this film is splash colour is set delhi just like its predecessor dibakar once again succeeds capturing essence this decadent city old world charm it carries film has its special moments like scene where lucky meets card seller girl innocence humanism is not lost one can almost feel oneself midst action paresh rawal plays three characters analogous peter sellers dr strangelove does fine job although his character dr handa was little too absolute evil types others showed shades gray were executed well by rawal dialogue is witty funny resembles elements same pulp fiction one is inclined think film does lose its way second half entire vacation episode story becomes bit drag ending carries no surprises but as whole film does well keep its spectators glued screen however i must say that most shortcomings film come light only when it is compared global standards if one is talking about bollywood trash it churns out regularly dostana yuvvraaj then this film is truly light years ahead every possible department its sad truth bollywood that talent dies poor man ones with absolute power industry amitabh bacchan srk kjo are mortified experimentation serving up anything that hasnt been dumbed down average iq american indian audiences i yearn day when independent original thought is given credence respect bollywood agreed that this film isnt stuff legend but its start symbol defiance that is why it should be given even more credit than it deserves stylish witty entertaining this film is must watch all people out there who have been suffering brain damage at hands karan johar rgv yash chopra co i give it 8 10 mostly due brilliant first half movie whole well done dibakar moshai,0.5340332722832721,0.14694841269841274,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.08, 'Fear': 0.44}"
8.0,Excellent Flick,"Director Dibankar Banerjee comes up with another excellent movie with Oye Lucky.. after Khosla. If Khosla was good this one is even better. Abhay Deol has carved a niche for himself with films like Ek Chalis, Manorama, and now this one. Brilliant script was supported by brilliant acting. I am really happy that Bollywood has started making films the Hollywood style. The still photographs used in the movie was something new to Bollywood and it suited the script perfectly. Abhay Deol is turning out to be a good actor and he now can be placed in the category of his illustrious cousins.

8.0,Masterpiece of a movie !!,"Oye Lucky Lucky Oye ! Lucky to get such a wonderful movie. when bollywood is producing only crap on name of Big flicks, OLLO, comparatively very low budget flick, brings a Breeze of freshness. The movie is a true masterpiece and extremely original because of its sheer brilliant direction. Hats off to Mr.Dibakar Banerjee for this great, aesthetic and tasteful movie in all the aspects. Dibakar earns full points for being that courageous to experiment is all the parts of movie, whether it is characterization, or multiple roles by Paresh Bhai, or folk, traditional music. Creativity inside him seems to be boiling in full temperature and that really raises our expectation bar for the next time. Abhay Deol could be the only adequate choice for that Ultra cool ""Superchor"" and he proves it. Abhay, having a special crowd of fans, again gifts them a terrific movie. His acing is awesome and fits very nicely to the character. His chuckling face, innocent smile drives you crazy and evokes a sense of pristine happiness inside you. Paresh Rawal is one of the most talented character artist of Hindi film industry and this movie consolidates the fact. One thing, I am sure about the movie, those who will like it, wont be able to control himself watching it again and again. Very solid performance by young lucky and his cute, innocent greeting card girl. That sequence of movie is super cute and makes you hold your heart and breath. Music adds flavor in the movie and very nicely transplanted in background, that makes movie very speedy.

,Lucky Charm!,"'Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!' is a dark comedy satire that revolves around a young thief and is set in Delhi. Banerjee portrays Delhi and its inhabitants with a wonderful sense of humour and he brings out its essence while one can easily relate to the characters. The cool soundtrack, slick and witty dialogues, intriguing visuals and smooth camera-work brings style. The screenplay is solid but the pacing is a little uneven. In some parts, the film tends to drag. It needed a little more energy. I like how Banerjee makes the romance angles (Lucky' childhood romance and his romantic involvement with Sonal) a part of the story without allowing it to dominate the entire film (which is one mistake many directors seem to make).Abhay Deol is rightfully cast in the title role. He has definitely moved further ahead of all the actors of his generation by experimenting with different films and succeeding in delivering convincing performances. To Lucky he brings a certain class, slickness, depth and energy and yet, being a clever thief, there's a vulnerability about him that is very effectively portrayed. Neetu Chandra is gorgeous and has a strong screen presence. Three Paresh Rawals is a little too much to bear. I would have preferred him to play one character, Gogi Bhai. He doesn't bring that much difference between the characters other than what he achieved with make-up.'Oye Lucky!

8.0,Glad to see something New and So Interesting!,"I must say, I thought this was just gonna be another flop movie, but it really caught my attention since beginning. Abhay Deol is a very decent actor and his chemistry with the Legendary Presh Rawal in 3 different looks and roles worked really good. Abhay needs to do more roles like this. And the casting was done superbly, even the young boy playing Abhay's role did a very good too.

4.0,This one probably plays better if you are an Indian...,"This film covers the life of Lucky from being a cocky teenager to his coming to national attention when his huge cache of stolen items is seized by the police. In between, he tries very hard to romance a 'nice girl' and spends the rest of his time stealing--mostly, though not exclusively, luxury cars.I live in the States and am not Indian. This is important because I think ""Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!"" is a film that probably plays much better if you are Indian. As for me, I didn't see Lucky Singh as anything other than a fast-talking thief. I can only assume that Indians see him as a bit of an anti-hero because he mostly seems to steal from rich folks. So, for me, it was a film about a guy who was a crook and a cocky jerk. He'd steal and then flash his pretty eyes at the screen...but that wasn't enough for me. Overall, a very disappointing film because I simply disliked EVERYONE in the film...EVERYONE...and the plot never was particularly engaging.

He was strongly detested by the police and had stolen millions by the time he was caught. A modern day Robin Hood with a twist, he robbed both the rich and the poor without prejudice. Nothing was too big nor was anything too insignificant to escape his attention. The film opens with his trial and charts his rise from the projects of crime ridden suburban Delhi to the very heart of the corridors of power. Along the way he makes lifelong friends, falls in love an manages to outwit the entire law and order machinery.The writing is smart.The direction is fabulous.Kudos to Dibakar Banerjee!

7.0,Meet the New-Age Hindi Cinema,"I loved OLLO. Its a relief in the times of Karan Johars around. Its very Hollywood-ish, and that again is not the reason I love it.For people who have followed works of Martin Scorsese, they may find an impact of him on the director of OLLO. Take pictures shown in between scenes for example. Or take the un-usual-for-bollywood dialogue style of not saying the obvious thing. (Hope you get my point).You'll find these all similar to Scorsese's style, and for a bigger proof, you may like to know that the scene in which the Boss (Paresh Rawal) tries to break Abhay's balls a little bit when he doesn't greet him properly, is straight-away lifted from a very similar scene in Goodfellas (1990).Frankly speaking, I don't give a damn. OLLO is something that represents new-age bollywood, so what if the makers are inspired by others.

Though the film flopped at the box office, yet it has earned a cult following ever-since its DVD release. Watch this one, because its the best flick you'll see in months at least. Superb film!

He's excellent as the Punjabi, fantastic as the don and simply outstanding as the doctor. He's a legend and rightly so. Neetu Chandra is good. Archana Puran Singh is mind-blowing. She can never be doubted, she's an amazing actress. The actor who plays Abhay's friend is natural. The girl who plays Neetu's sister is adorable.On the whole 'Oye Lucky Lucky Oye' is as catchy as its title. A Winner all the way!

,"Good, entertaining Indian comedy/drama","Charming well made Indian comedy/drama based on the real life adventures of a charming, wildly successful thief. This owes more than a little debt to Scorsese, ""Goodfellas"" especially, crossing the line from homage to rip-off at moments. Meanwhile, it lacks Scorsese's eye for deeper pain and moral complexities. None-the-less, this is well filmed, well acted, and ultimately kind of moving, while revealing something of the Indian middle class to those of us half a world away. But at times the broadness of the comedy just feels like its from a different film, and that takes away from the effectiveness. Very catchy score, and the last 5 minutes helps pull it all together and gives the film something more.",good entertaining indian comedy drama,charming well made indian comedy drama based real life adventures charming wildly successful thief this owes more than little debt scorsese goodfellas especially crossing line homage rip off at moments meanwhile it lacks scorseses eye deeper pain moral complexities none less this is well filmed well acted ultimately kind moving while revealing something indian middle class those us half world away but at times broadness comedy just feels like its different film that takes away effectiveness very catchy score last 5 minutes helps pull it all together gives film something more,0.5222222222222223,0.26828703703703705,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.19, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9.0,Perhaps the Best Comedy of the Year. Brilliant in all sense.,"First of all, i regret to have OLLO( Oye Lucky Lucky Oye!) downloaded from the internet. I was anticipating for it's release for a long time, and i feel sorry for not watching it at the theater. And Why am i feeling sorry? For the fact that you cannot make me laugh at your jokes like you do in Golmaal Returns, Malamaal Weekly, Phir Hera Pheri or the sick Partner,for which i spent an over 1000 bucks, and miss OLLO at theater which made me LMAO.As a sensible movie-goer I always keep in mind whether the movie I am gonna watch is worth the money spending. And i bet you, OLLO wont let you down.I was wondering why do certain intelligent movie-goers have to wait for the year end to have a movie like OLLO. Abhay Deol has again proved himself as a actor with a niche. As critics have put him, he's certainly a Deol with a Difference. And he carries off with the role superbly. Even his last comic role as a detective-to-be in Manorama Under Six Feet was very funny indeed with the dialogs constituting slang's of North India. However,many movie goers would rarely get the jokes in Mumbai, as I already have observed the same situation with the masterpiece Omkara, where people in the cinema hall were scoffing at dialogs.Having my roots around Delhi I enjoyed the characters portraying their roles with such perfection. The slang, the half cut (not censored) abuses, and not to mention the detailing that went into styling the characters given the backdrop of the movie.Dibakar surely knows the Delhi Underbelly and we already can see with his two products viz KKG(Khosla Ka Ghosla) and OLLO, and he does it with panache which is true to its roots. As a Delhite, you can literally identify with the character as if you know him or you just feel like he's your next door neighbor. Now that is what i call sensible Cinema,and not like other slapstick silly jokes as observed in Golmaal Sequels or any other Malamaal Weekly. I mean if your script is that much sorts of a killer, you don't need to hire Akshay Kumar for deliverance. It comes out naturally.And OLLO does it with a flair.",perhaps best comedy year brilliant all sense,first all i regret have ollo oye lucky lucky oye downloaded internet i was anticipating its release long time i feel sorry not watching it at theater why am i feeling sorry fact that you cannot make me laugh at your jokes like you do golmaal returns malamaal weekly phir hera pheri or sick partner which i spent over 1000 bucks miss ollo at theater which made me lmao as sensible movie goer i always keep mind whether movie i am gonna watch is worth money spending i bet you ollo wont let you down i was wondering why do certain intelligent movie goers have wait year end have movie like ollo abhay deol has again proved himself as actor with niche as critics have put him hes certainly deol with difference he carries off with role superbly even his last comic role as detective be manorama under six feet was very funny indeed with dialogs constituting slangs north india however many movie goers would rarely get jokes mumbai as i already have observed same situation with masterpiece omkara where people cinema hall were scoffing at dialogs having my roots around delhi i enjoyed characters portraying their roles with such perfection slang half cut not censored abuses not mention detailing that went into styling characters given backdrop movie dibakar surely knows delhi underbelly we already can see with his two products viz kkg khosla ka ghosla ollo he does it with panache which is true its roots as delhite you can literally identify with character as if you know him or you just feel like hes your next door neighbor now that is what i call sensible cinema not like other slapstick silly jokes as observed golmaal sequels or any other malamaal weekly i mean if your script is that much sorts killer you dont need hire akshay kumar deliverance it comes out naturally ollo does it with flair,0.5582947530864195,0.16725639329805994,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.37}"
,Good Abhay Deol in fine follow up feature by Dibakar Banerjee,"This is Dibakar Banerjee's follow up to 'Khosla Ka Ghosla', and he doesn't disappoint this time either. The film is a lot of fun with Abhay Deol excelling in the title role of thief Lucky Singh. He has no qualms and is willing to steal just about anything that's available. Abhay brings a certain likability which makes it easy for the audience to sympathize with a clearly amoral character. The dialog sounds remarkably authentic and the film is very effective at exposing class differences. Paresh Rawal has three roles but doesn't do justice to all of them. The film is a tad overlong and Abhay's romantic life isn't particularly well developed.

7.0,Funny.,"The film is not too much to expect but in these depressing times of Hindi film cinema, it should be seen as a sign of relief. The film follows the story of a thief, whose ways to steal things are the basis of making the film funny.
