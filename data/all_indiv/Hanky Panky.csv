8.0,"A classic comedy of errors which has fun, suspense and soul","Hrishikesh Mukherjee directs another comedy movie involving simple middle-class people and presents it through their everyday struggle. The entire picture is simple, authentic and fun. The concept of a young guy who would go to any extent to not lose his job is very interesting, and Mukherjee handles it with great success. Gol Maal is a comedy of errors and it's wonderfully developed and narrated. It's not a complex story, but it's not a silly one either, and the simplicity works in its favour. The film benefits from its genuinely lifelike sets and costumes, its script, and its proceedings, which grow from humorous to amusing to suspenseful to hilarious. It gets funnier and funnier as it goes along, as the conflict gets more complicated, the obstacles are doubled, and the irony grows. But the movie also has soul, and that's one of its high-points. The characters are colourful and memorable, but they also have depth which makes them easy to identify with. The relationships are also very impressively portrayed and it's nice to see how united families and relatives can be and how they care for each other and help each other in times of need.Gol Maal is very well cast, and for me, there are three actors who totally nail their parts: Amol Palekar, Utpal Dutt and Dina Pathak. Palekar is excellent in the role of a simpleton who is forced to live a double life in order to save his job. He displays the differences between the two roles his character has to play brilliantly, with just subtle change in body language and a few nuances here and there. Dutt is hilarious, skillfully creating a memorable persona of a strict boss with a soft heart. His is the funniest performance in the film. Dina Pathak, one of Hindi cinema's greatest character actresses, is awesome as she is in all the films I've seen her in. She comes across as a vivacious, fun-loving and kind woman and, like Palekar, wonderfully plays her 'two' roles. Among the supporting cast, David stands out and is as always likable as the kind uncle. The film also has fantastic music by maestro R.D. Burman. ""Aane Wala Pal"" is my favourite number, and it is performed to perfection by the great Kishore Kumar. Gol Maal is overall a lighthearted and heartwarming comedy but it has the power to captivate, and it can always provide a fun watch for the entire family.",classic comedy errors which has fun suspense soul,hrishikesh mukherjee directs another comedy movie involving simple middle class people presents it through their everyday struggle entire picture is simple authentic fun concept young guy who would go any extent not lose his job is very interesting mukherjee handles it with great success gol maal is comedy errors its wonderfully developed narrated its not complex story but its not silly one either simplicity works its favour film benefits its genuinely lifelike sets costumes its script its proceedings which grow humorous amusing suspenseful hilarious it gets funnier funnier as it goes along as conflict gets more complicated obstacles are doubled irony grows but movie also has soul thats one its high points characters are colourful memorable but they also have depth which makes them easy identify with relationships are also very impressively portrayed its nice see how united families relatives can be how they care each other help each other times need gol maal is very well cast me there are three actors who totally nail their parts amol palekar utpal dutt dina pathak palekar is excellent role simpleton who is forced live double life order save his job he displays differences between two roles his character has play brilliantly with just subtle change body language few nuances here there dutt is hilarious skillfully creating memorable persona strict boss with soft heart his is funniest performance film dina pathak one hindi cinemas greatest character actresses is awesome as she is all films ive seen her she comes across as vivacious fun loving kind woman like palekar wonderfully plays her two roles among supporting cast david stands out is as always likable as kind uncle film also has fantastic music by maestro r d burman aane wala pal is my favourite number it is performed perfection by great kishore kumar gol maal is overall lighthearted heartwarming comedy but it has power captivate it can always provide fun watch entire family,0.5917418546365915,0.3081233386496544,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.29, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.38}"

9.0,Brilliant,"This has got to be one of the best movies I have, and will ever, see. It's comedy at its best.The casting is superb, with Amul Palekar, Dina Pathak, Utpal Dutt, Manju Singh, and of course, a whole lot of special appearances.The story is quite ridiculous at times, but the acting and music more than makes up for it. Some of the sequences such as Ramprasad's interview with Utpal Dutt and the scene where Dina Pathack comes into their house through the window, are out of this world.

10.0,Top Class Comedy !!!!!,"One of the best comedies of all time in Hindi cinema. Gone are the days when comedy used to be clean and without loud expressions or stupid facial gestures. Golmaal comes out to be one of the favorite comedies of all times. As an adamant businessman, Utpal Dutt excels in his performance. This is probably his best role in Hindi movies. Amol Palekar outrightly describes that why he is renowned as an actor of extraordinary caliber. The supporting cast viz. Deven Verma, Dina Pathak and David have added pinch of flavor to the outcome. Keshto and Om Prakash have done well in a small cameo. Salute to the great director, Hrishikesh Mukherjee who has given loads of humor with excellent movies viz. Chupke Chupke and Anand.

,Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Comedy of Error(s),"Well first thing's first. If you liked 'Chupke Chupke' (another comedy of error by Mr. Mukherjee) then you'll almost certainly enjoy 'Gol Maal'. Mukherjee does what he's very specialized in doing: telling the simple story of the common man and this time again he does it with comedy. The film opens with the hilarious title song and the story slightly falls on the same line of Mukherjee's 'Chupke Chupke' but the humour and the actors make the moments their own and 'Gol Maal' is very much its own film. Amol Palekar as the simpleton who is 'forced' to live a double life, Utpal Dutt as the opinionated boss and Dina Pathak as the vivacious mother/aunt create a wonderful comic team. Lending support are Manju Singh as the happy-go-lucky sister, Deven Verma as...himself and a cute Bindiya Goswami as the love interest. One will notice several cameos by stars like Rekha, Amitabh Bachchan etc. 'Gol Maal' presents several situations of confusion, suspense, and drama - all of it with a touch of comedy. The only thing that slightly irritated me was the poor cinematography as the camera was a little too shaky at times. I was watching it really late at night (a time during which most normal people have already entered REM sleep) and couldn't stop laughing. I think it would have been a lot more entertaining had I watched it with my parents (as was the case with 'Chupke Chupke'). Perhaps thats because there's the additional comedy of watching them laugh out loud.",hrishikesh mukherjees comedy error s,well first things first if you liked chupke chupke another comedy error by mr mukherjee then youll almost certainly enjoy gol maal mukherjee does what hes very specialized doing telling simple story common man this time again he does it with comedy film opens with hilarious title song story slightly falls same line mukherjees chupke chupke but humour actors make moments their own gol maal is very much its own film amol palekar as simpleton who is forced live double life utpal dutt as opinionated boss dina pathak as vivacious mother aunt create wonderful comic team lending support are manju singh as happy go lucky sister deven verma as himself cute bindiya goswami as love interest one will notice several cameos by stars like rekha amitabh bachchan etc gol maal presents several situations confusion suspense drama all it with touch comedy only thing that slightly irritated me was poor cinematography as camera was little too shaky at times i was watching it really late at night time during which most normal people have already entered rem sleep couldnt stop laughing i think it would have been lot more entertaining had i watched it with my parents as was case with chupke chupke perhaps thats because theres additional comedy watching them laugh out loud,0.5257076719576719,0.1965425084175084,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.19, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.33}"
8.0,Gut busting comedy,"A comedy of errors in which a lie and a mistaken identity sets into motion a domino effect of such proportions that every time a character faces an obstacle your heart leaps into your mouth, only to fall back with a thud because you continuously feel the urge to laugh uncontrollably.Like any Hrishikesh Mukherjee movie, Gol Maal tells the story of next door people in the most heart-warming manner with a good dose of clean and genuine humor that takes a clean bite at the culture and traditions of middle-class India. Ramprasad Sharma (Amol Palekar), a chartered accountant by profession, is a colorful personality who is a sports junkie in the afternoons and an amateur singer in the evenings. With the help of his uncle he lands up a job at a trading firm and embarks on a mission to please his boss Bhavani Shankar (Uttpal Dutt in a hilarious turn) because his whole identity is fake considering his boss disapproves fashion, vehemently opposes the obsession of sports among the youth (although he is a secret sports fan himself), dislikes people who abbreviate their names and use recommendation to get a job, encourages purity of language, and sees mustache as a symbol of pride and a window to the soul. Ramprasad has none of the ""good"" qualities sans the mustache, his only saving grace, which he ends up losing in an attempt to save his skin after being spotted at a Hockey match by his boss. Remembering the plot of a movie an actor friend of his is doing, he manages to convince Bhavani Shankar that it was not him whom he had seen at the stadium but his jobless, good-for-nothing, clean shaven identical twin Laxmanprasad Sharma aka Lucky. So, during the day Ramprasad works as a straight-as-a-reed worker bee quoting quasi intellectual teachings of his imaginary father and in the evening takes on the role of his mustacheless notorious twin brother who teaches music to the boss's daughter and also romances her on the sly.Hrishikesh Mukherjee, once again succeeds in creating a complex story around some simple and some quirky characters like Mrs. Kamala Srivastav (Dina Pathak) – a reluctant mother for hire and Bade Babu (Yunus Parvez), a not so bright colleague of Ramprasad whose favorite pastime is pulling hair out of his nostrils. He went so far as to mount this broad satire on the platform of Bollywood itself wherein an actor friend of Ramprasad Deven (Deven Varma as himself) mouthpieces the idea that life indeed is stranger than fiction as depicted in the movies and does the humble job of furnishing the fake mustache to the protagonist, the complex results of which sets the whole hanky-panky business into motion.The rest of the cast is mediocre except for Shobha Khote and David in minor roles. Bindiya Goswami as the love interest only shines in her introduction scene and has nothing better to do except look lovelorn. Needless to say, it is the comic timing between Uttpal Dutt and Amol Palekar that is the star of the movie and the two went on to do three more films together with mixed results.",gut busting comedy,comedy errors which lie mistaken identity sets into motion domino effect such proportions that every time character faces obstacle your heart leaps into your mouth only fall back with thud because you continuously feel urge laugh uncontrollably like any hrishikesh mukherjee movie gol maal tells story next door people most heart warming manner with good dose clean genuine humor that takes clean bite at culture traditions middle class india ramprasad sharma amol palekar chartered accountant by profession is colorful personality who is sports junkie afternoons amateur singer evenings with help his uncle he lands up job at trading firm embarks mission please his boss bhavani shankar uttpal dutt hilarious turn because his whole identity is fake considering his boss disapproves fashion vehemently opposes obsession sports among youth although he is secret sports fan himself dislikes people who abbreviate their names use recommendation get job encourages purity language sees mustache as symbol pride window soul ramprasad has none good qualities sans mustache his only saving grace which he ends up losing attempt save his skin after being spotted at hockey match by his boss remembering plot movie actor friend his is doing he manages convince bhavani shankar that it was not him whom he had seen at stadium but his jobless good nothing clean shaven identical twin laxmanprasad sharma aka lucky so during day ramprasad works as straight as reed worker bee quoting quasi intellectual teachings his imaginary father evening takes role his mustacheless notorious twin brother who teaches music bosss daughter also romances her sly hrishikesh mukherjee once again succeeds creating complex story around some simple some quirky characters like mrs kamala srivastav dina pathak reluctant mother hire bade babu yunus parvez not so bright colleague ramprasad whose favorite pastime is pulling hair out his nostrils he went so far as mount this broad satire platform bollywood itself wherein actor friend ramprasad deven deven varma as himself mouthpieces idea that life indeed is stranger than fiction as depicted movies does humble job furnishing fake mustache protagonist complex results which sets whole hanky panky business into motion rest cast is mediocre except shobha khote david minor roles bindiya goswami as love interest only shines her introduction scene has nothing better do except look lovelorn needless say it is comic timing between uttpal dutt amol palekar that is star movie two went do three more films together with mixed results,0.5652820910973084,0.14230072463768118,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.42}"
10.0,The greatest Bollywood comedy movie of all times!,"This classic 70's flick is regarded by many as undoubtedly the greatest Bollywood comedy movie of all times. Utpal Dutt is mostly remembered for his role as a strict boss and a person who holds the qualities of the Raj era to his heart, and in the process creating a generation gap between himself and the entire world. The ""Double Role"" played by the next door boy Amol Palekar in order to cover his real colors in front of his boss and his girlfriend makes a riot of a script such that you will remember for a long time.

,Golmaal Hai Bhai Sab Golmaal Hai . . .,"First of all, I sincerely thank my dear friend and esteemed MS member - Deepak Ji (@deepak27) for inspiring me to write a review of this classic comedy by the legendary director - Hrishikesh Mukherjee. I am sorry Deepak Ji for being late in posting this review. The delay took place because I wanted to watch it again before writing the review.Golmaal (1979) is one of the best and (commercially successful) movies of the perennial simpleton of Bollywood movies of the seventies - Amol Palekar. However, despite his straightforwardness, sincerity to work and middle-class manners, he is not that simpleton in this movie. He is smart enough to tackle his practical problems with the contingency approach of management and befool his employer by creating the fake identity of his look-alike twin brother. And this is the Golmaal (confusion / hodgepodge) in this movie which consists of not only the fake mother of the hero and his sister but also her (fake) look-alike twin sister as well. The end result of this Golmaal is plain and simple - laugh-filled healthy entertainment for the audience.Ram (Amol Palekar) is an orphan who lives with his sister Ratna (Manju Singh) and needs a decent job after passing the C.A. exam (just like the writer of this review). His maternal uncle - Kedar (David) directs him to an industrialist Bhavaani Shankar (Utpal Dutt) who is not only orthodox and old-fashioned but also a bit finicky. He does not like youths taking interests in extra-curricular things and has a special disliking for the clean-shaven males (not sporting a mustache). Ram presents himself before him the way he wants his employee to be and soon wins his confidence through his sincere work too. However the trouble starts with his being caught by Bhavaani Shankar while watching a Hockey match. Now to save his job, he creates the fake story of his vagabond look-alike twin brother - Lakshman. A new twist arrives with Bhavaani Shankar's hiring Lakshman's services to take music tuition of her daughter - Urmila (Bindiya Goswami). The young pair falls in love. Further, since Ram had taken leave to watch the Hockey match under the excuse of his mother's illness, now he has to create a fake mother also who is a theatre artist - Kamla Srivastav (Deena Pathak). Even worse, when she is caught by Bhavaani Shankar in a party, her fake twin sister is also to be created. And the climax comes when Bhavaani Shankar decides to marry his daughter to Ram but she is willing to marry Lakshman (without knowing like her father that both are the same). The laughter-filled climax leads to the union of the lovers and clarity of everything before Bhavaani Shankar (i.e., resolution of the Golmaal).The story based on the plot of fake identities and the lies spoken is not only full of laughs and entertaining sequences but also touches at several places through the human relations and sentiments among the middle class people. The brother-sister relation, the mother-daughter as well as the mother-son relation and the concern of the benevolent maternal uncle for his nephew and niece, everything is heart-warming and creating sublime feelings in the heart of the viewer. The characters of the helping friends of the hero are also to be seen in this context. Right from the start to the very finish, the movie is highly entertaining and impressive by all means.Amol Palekar was a master in performing such roles and it is undoubtedly one of his best performances. The artist matching him in performance is Utpal Dutt. Their amazing on-screen chemistry was later seen in Naram Garam too (which I found even better than Golmaal). Both these great actors have generated unlimited fun for the audience with their hilarious interactions. Deena Pathak, Manju Singh, Deven Varma, David and the other supporting actors in cameos, everybody has done well. Bindiya Goswami has filled the quota of heroine.Director Hrishikesh Mukherjee demonstrated his mastery in not only profound movies but also comedies. Golmaal was a box office hit because it effortlessly won the heart of the Indian audience. The movie does not contain a single boring scene. It starts hilariously and it ends hilariously as well. A perfect entertainment.Technically the movie is up to the mark. Hrishi Da's movies are always wrapped in simplicity. The same is with Golmaal. A middle class family environment has been maintained throughout the movie and there is no artificiality visible anywhere, may it be the office or the households. The length of the movie is also optimum.R.D. Burman has composed admirable music for the movie with the lyrics being penned by Gulzaar. The title track, Ek Din Sapne Mein Dekha Sapna and Ek Baat Kahoon Jo Maano Tum are all good. However the best number is Kishore Kumar's classic song - Aanewaala Pal Jaanewaala Hai.Golmaal has enormous repeat value. Anybody who watches it once, likes to watch it again.

10.0,The perfect comedy,"This is the perfect comedy! It has all the hallmarks of the genre. A delightful, optimistic young hero. A tempestuous young heroine. A stiff and prejudiced father. A garrulous uncle. A tough and sentimental aunt. Dopey friends. Misunderstandings. Seemingly unending conflict and a hilarious resolution.Amol Palekar shines as the hero, Ram. His character is absurdly unrealistic. He is a feckless youth and a devoted nephew and brother. He has a wicked sense of humour and strong religious devotion. He is a brilliant accountant and has a raft of boring opinions of Kabir. He is an incredibly hard worker and yet has a thriving social life. He loves sport more than anything else, but will sacrifice it for a job and for love. Ram is a chameleon, a supreme actor, and Palekar is utterly convincing as each of Ram's altar egos.The rest of the main cast are equally brilliant. Deven Verma is the best friend a young guy could ask for. Bindiya Goswami has just the right balance of disobedience and daughterly devotion to be utterly charming. Dina Pathak is hilarious as Kamla, the part-time actress who climbs through kitchen windows. And Utpal Dutt is nearly unbeatable as the fierce potential father-in-law, who thinks that only men with moustaches and without hobbies or nicknames have any value in modern India. He reminded me of Walter in Sterne's classic novel ""Tristram Shandy,"" a man of great status and absurd beliefs, but withal extremely likable.Like all the best comedies, this one takes place in a world just a little bit different from our own. Everyone is flawed, but there is no harm in that. Everyone misunderstands one another, but in the end all difficulties melt in the breeze.The plot unfolds breezily, and complication piles on complication as Ram's schemes get increasingly involved. I was grinning or laughing the whole way through, and I think you will too. 10/10",perfect comedy,this is perfect comedy it has all hallmarks genre delightful optimistic young hero tempestuous young heroine stiff prejudiced father garrulous uncle tough sentimental aunt dopey friends misunderstandings seemingly unending conflict hilarious resolution amol palekar shines as hero ram his character is absurdly unrealistic he is feckless youth devoted nephew brother he has wicked sense humour strong religious devotion he is brilliant accountant has raft boring opinions kabir he is incredibly hard worker yet has thriving social life he loves sport more than anything else but will sacrifice it job love ram is chameleon supreme actor palekar is utterly convincing as each rams altar egos rest main cast are equally brilliant deven verma is best friend young guy could ask bindiya goswami has just right balance disobedience daughterly devotion be utterly charming dina pathak is hilarious as kamla part time actress who climbs through kitchen windows utpal dutt is nearly unbeatable as fierce potential father law who thinks that only men with moustaches without hobbies or nicknames have any value modern india he reminded me walter sternes classic novel tristram shandy man great status absurd beliefs but withal extremely likable like all best comedies this one takes place world just little bit different our own everyone is flawed but there is no harm that everyone misunderstands one another but end all difficulties melt breeze plot unfolds breezily complication piles complication as rams schemes get increasingly involved i was grinning or laughing whole way through i think you will too 10 10,0.6702678571428572,0.2488343253968254,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.26, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.39}"

8.0,What a movie!!,"Someone has rightly said, you can watch this movie any number of times. The best part of Hrishikesh Mukharjee's movies is that he captures the time period, the lifestyle of that era where movie is setup, simple events or references from day to day life that reveals a lot about the time and society. This one is no exception.It will always give you a feeling of freshness even if you watch it continuously for a week. Pleasant is the one word I would like to associate with this movie in it's true sense. Utpal Datt is outstanding in his act, but he is Amol Palekar who stole the show.

9.0,"Good, clean fun","This is one of my favorite Hindi comedies of all time, as it is completely family friendly, has some genuinely hilarious moments and adheres to a subtlety in comedy which seems lost in the gyrating Govinda era of Hindi comedies.This is one of the few movies one can watch with the entire family and everyone, from the oldest to the youngest member, will enjoy it.A comedy of errors, our story begins with young CA grad Ram Prakash Sharma who is looking for modest employment. Enter his uncle, who advises him on how to behave to gain a position at the uncle's childhood friend, Bhawani Shankar's, company. Unfortunately, Bhawani Shankar is a man of strict tastes and fancies all young men of the time to be lazy and far too preoccupied with time-wasting activities such as sports, music and parties. Ram Prakash presents himself (according to the tutelage of his uncle) as the quintessential, too-good-to-be-true young man with no time for leisure and frivolities and all the time in the world for work and the serious things in life. Unfortunately, Ram Prakash's true self cannot be suppressed and he schemes to get out of work to watch a hockey match. Unluckiloy for him, Bhawani Shankar happens to see him at said match and confronts him, because of which Ram Prasad is forced to invent a twin, Laxman aka Lucky who is the very epitome of the sort of young man Bhawani Shankar detests. Things get further complicated when Ram Prasad is forced to invent a mother, having told Bhawani Shankar that she is still alive and ill as an excuse to go to the hockey match. What ensues due to the confusion is a tangled web of good old fashioned mix-ups and lies to keep the whole thing from falling in around Ram Prasad's ears.I would definitely recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys an interesting, non Givinda-esquire comedy, and of course, anyone who enjoys music as this movie has the very well known and loved Kishore Kumar number, ""Aane Wala Pal"".",good clean fun,this is one my favorite hindi comedies all time as it is completely family friendly has some genuinely hilarious moments adheres subtlety comedy which seems lost gyrating govinda era hindi comedies this is one few movies one can watch with entire family everyone oldest youngest member will enjoy it comedy errors our story begins with young ca grad ram prakash sharma who is looking modest employment enter his uncle who advises him how behave gain position at uncles childhood friend bhawani shankars company unfortunately bhawani shankar is man strict tastes fancies all young men time be lazy far too preoccupied with time wasting activities such as sports music parties ram prakash presents himself according tutelage his uncle as quintessential too good be true young man with no time leisure frivolities all time world work serious things life unfortunately ram prakashs true self cannot be suppressed he schemes get out work watch hockey match unluckiloy him bhawani shankar happens see him at said match confronts him because which ram prasad is forced invent twin laxman aka lucky who is very epitome sort young man bhawani shankar detests things get further complicated when ram prasad is forced invent mother having told bhawani shankar that she is still alive ill as excuse go hockey match what ensues due confusion is tangled web good old fashioned mix ups lies keep whole thing falling around ram prasads ears i would definitely recommend movie anyone who enjoys interesting non givinda esquire comedy course anyone who enjoys music as this movie has very well known loved kishore kumar number aane wala pal,0.5695121951219512,0.11504065040650409,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.28, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.34}"

9.0,Simply Superb,"Review By Kamal KWhat a beautiful way it was to end the 70s era with a happy laughing ride family entertainer by Hrishikesh Mukherjee.""Gol maal hai bhai sab gol maal hai"", is how movie stars and give viewers an idea of how its gonna be but it goes more than there expectations for sure where the laughing ride starts with Ram Prasad Sharma (Amol Palekar) getting a job by faking his personality to impress Bhawani Shankar( Utpal Dutt). "" pitaji kaha karte the"" already starts giving joy before main dialogue . The entry of Lakshman Prasad Sharma take it to an all-new height where the error comedy starts and viewers go on the laughter ride through a guy playing a double role in his life to save his job. R. D. Burman as always gives beautiful musical experience and ""Aane wala kal, Jaane wala hai"" is beautifully placed in the movie where the romance starts. We see more and more characters coming one by one like Lakshman, fake mother, then twin of fake mother(shubha khote) creating more curiosity in viewers and still, movie keep taking more and more hype which shows how a complicated story can be simply well scripted and picturized. Comic timing is very well applied with some physical comedy as well in last 20 min., Even characters with less screen time did amazing work such as ""Bade Babu"" in office and friends of ""Ram Prasad Sharma"" and also few special appearances.Behind the comedy, it shows a message that how society needs to be attached to its roots and also open to adapt to other cultures in terms of sports, music, dance, appearance for a development, which is portrayed in the very end when Bhavani Shankar shaves his mustaches. Overall it is a perfect combination of pure comedy and family entertainment which can be forwarded to the generations.",simply superb,review by kamal kwhat beautiful way it was end 70s era with happy laughing ride family entertainer by hrishikesh mukherjee gol maal hai bhai sab gol maal hai is how movie stars give viewers idea how its gonna be but it goes more than there expectations sure where laughing ride starts with ram prasad sharma amol palekar getting job by faking his personality impress bhawani shankar utpal dutt pitaji kaha karte already starts giving joy before main dialogue entry lakshman prasad sharma take it all new height where error comedy starts viewers go laughter ride through guy playing double role his life save his job r d burman as always gives beautiful musical experience aane wala kal jaane wala hai is beautifully placed movie where romance starts we see more more characters coming one by one like lakshman fake mother then twin fake mother shubha khote creating more curiosity viewers still movie keep taking more more hype which shows how complicated story can be simply well scripted picturized comic timing is very well applied with some physical comedy as well last 20 min even characters with less screen time did amazing work such as bade babu office friends ram prasad sharma also few special appearances behind comedy it shows message that how society needs be attached its roots also open adapt other cultures terms sports music dance appearance development which is portrayed very end when bhavani shankar shaves his mustaches overall it is perfect combination pure comedy family entertainment which can be forwarded generations,0.533960258960259,0.25358897858897855,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.5}"
