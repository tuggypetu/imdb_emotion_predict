8.0,Classic RomCom,"As others mentioned, this checks all the boxes in a romcom. What is a great bonus is the location and cinematography. It really is beautiful looking film which makes it all the more enjoyable.The story is of Lola that decides to leave her current job as a wine sales person and venture out on her own with her own company. She decides the best way to start is to convince the owner of Vaughn wines in Australia that when distributing in the US they should use her new company. So off to Australia she goes to end up on a sheep farm. Never before has sheep farming been so lovely, beautiful, fun and happy. The leads have nice chemistry and no one is really bad. Even in a bar fight everyone is friends right after. And the big secret, all romcoms have it, isn't really terrible or tragic.Good escapism and nice time. Enjoy it with a glass of wine.",classic romcom,as others mentioned this checks all boxes romcom what is great bonus is location cinematography it really is beautiful looking film which makes it all more enjoyable story is lola that decides leave her current job as wine sales person venture out her own with her own company she decides best way start is convince owner vaughn wines australia that when distributing us they should use her new company so off australia she goes end up sheep farm never before has sheep farming been so lovely beautiful fun happy leads have nice chemistry no one is really bad even bar fight everyone is friends right after big secret all romcoms have it isnt really terrible or tragic good escapism nice time enjoy it with glass wine,0.665566378066378,0.3057810245310245,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.41, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.14, 'Fear': 0.28}"

7.0,Surprisingly Good,"I expected the usual romantic comedy, with a cliche plot, cheesy writing, and standard acting. But I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.Victoria Justice was never my favorite actress but she was actually really good in this. Her acting seemed more natural than the usual actresses that get casted in these types of movies. She had a good amount of chemistry with her male lead which made the movie easy to watch.I really liked how her character wasn't the usual over the top American female who suddenly turns into some clumsy fool who squeels after stepping in mud. Sure, Lola did some of that but it was admirable the way she embraced Australia and work on the farm.The plot, while enjoyable, is pretty standard. The male lead is hiding a secret, which is revealed after being intimate with the female. She feels betrayed after they both opened up to each other, blah blah blah.Have I seen this story before? Absolutely. But this movie is enjoyable if you like the familiar pacing of a rom com.",surprisingly good,i expected usual romantic comedy with cliche plot cheesy writing standard acting but i was actually surprised by how much i enjoyed this film victoria justice was never my favorite actress but she was actually really good this her acting seemed more natural than usual actresses that get casted these types movies she had good amount chemistry with her male lead which made movie easy watch i really liked how her character wasnt usual over top american female who suddenly turns into some clumsy fool who squeels after stepping mud sure lola did some that but it was admirable way she embraced australia work farm plot while enjoyable is pretty standard male lead is hiding secret which is revealed after being intimate with female she feels betrayed after they both opened up each other blah blah blah have i seen this story before absolutely but this movie is enjoyable if you like familiar pacing rom com,0.4778528528528528,0.15360360360360362,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.33, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.22}"

7.0,It is what it is with hood views,"All the other reviews reference it being a rom com and while true, there is a big difference between the ""Hallmark"" rom coms (which this movie fits squarely into the category) and blockbuster or theatrical release type rom come and they should be judged differently.The lead actors are good, side characters too much as usual (but pretty good casting job all around), scenery is beautiful, story is fine for this genre but not overly memorable. Falls square into the formula that's created a niche audience for hundreds of these types of movies.Run time is about an hour 45 and it provided for an entertaining early Friday evening movie.Not the best, but better than a lot of them (as it should be as Netflix has deep pockets and creates less per year than say Hallmark does per season)",it is what it is with hood views,all other reviews reference it being rom com while true there is big difference between hallmark rom coms which this movie fits squarely into category blockbuster or theatrical release type rom come they should be judged differently lead actors are good side characters too much as usual but pretty good casting job all around scenery is beautiful story is fine this genre but not overly memorable falls square into formula thats created niche audience hundreds these types movies run time is about hour 45 it provided entertaining early friday evening movie not best but better than lot them as it should be as netflix has deep pockets creates less per year than say hallmark does per season,0.49675925925925934,0.21250000000000002,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.35, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.06, 'Fear': 0.41}"

There wasn't an ounce of originality in the plot- literally every typical trope was used, leading to one of the most predictable films in existence.

5.0,Chance For a Passable Rom-Com Ruined By Lola,"Eventually, one gets tired of the stupid, mental games that immature people play. There's always an excuse to duck out of something that can potentially be good. What amazed me was that in the end, Lola tells Max that it won't work, and she gives him a list of reasons why. In short, SHE shot HIM down. And yet, she expects Max to step up and make an effort to keep her as she confesses to Audra? What supreme arrogance!In the Rom-Com world, things are always resolved and put together in a nice little box with a nice little bow. The proverbial ""happy ending"" is always the safe play. But it's rarely ever the smart one or the realistic one.I don't know many people--let alone guys--who would ""step up"" when they've just had the door slammed in their face. Why would anyone? These typical ""Hallmark"" plot ploys are tiresome and overused, and it makes Lola come across as conceited and immature to expect anyone to make a play for her after what she did.Lola is an former LA wine executive who is trying to land a major client in Australia after quitting her job and going solo. Victoria Justice does a decent job, even if she does look like a ""fish out of water"" in this role. She acts like someone who doesn't want to break a nail or get their hands dirty. Frankly, Kristin Davis did a far more convincing job in ""Holiday in the Wild"" and perhaps Justice should have gotten some tips. Her inept attempts of trying to adjust to farm life were over-contrived which made them not very convincing as someone who keeps causing and getting into accidents. In short, her physical comedic attempts often came up short, leaving me shaking my head with a ""Really? That's the best you could do?"" An actor shouldn't look like they're ""trying"" to be inept in these types of situations. It just comes off badly.Even after a couple of months, she's still the only one in heavy make-up and expensive clothes, while the rest of the women have the rugged/worn look that anyone would bound to have! I guess Justice has to ""look good"" no matter what.Still, the one saving grace of the film is the scenery. I'm sure a number of people will want to visit Queensland after watching this film. Most of the rest of the cast--except for Lucy Durak who was just absolutely awful--are pretty good.The story is fairly typical and predictable for a Rom-Com.

,Enjoyable; solid acting; meh troupy plot,"I always think of Victoria Justice from her younger teenage roles, but she surprised me in this one. Even though it is a typical cheesy RomCom, her acting felt solid to me. Justice and Demos played well off one another. The scenery/cinematography is lovely. The storyline is predictable, but enjoyable. The writer's needed classic drama (SPOILERS) near the story's ending, but the cheesy reaction of Justice's character (due to script, not the acting itself) to the news of Demos' identity was over the top. The best parts of this film were the scenery and the pure, sappy RomCom-ness of it all. The most trite and annoying part was Justice's character going into business with her prior co-worker, who was written as goofy/backstabbing. In the real world, we don't go all ""love u 4ever, work-wife; we can be besties again,"" to a deceitful co-worker. That part was too lame, even for a RomCom.
