10.0,A powerful film that shows the true cost of war,"""Grave of the Fireflies"" is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics, like Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Akira,"" or ""Princess Mononoke,"" or ""Spirited Away"" (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is ""Grave of the Fireflies.""What we have with ""Grave of the Fireflies,"" is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter), I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is. The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them.""Grave of the Fireflies"" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways, but this film has to be the ""Schindler's List"" of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone.",powerful film that shows true cost war,grave fireflies is one most ambitious depressing quite frankly best films that ive ever seen i was nearly moved tears by this films brave treatment such critical subject matter yes its anime piece but surprisingly it came out 1988 during time where most japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths borderline pornography or both as fan anime genre film making many great pieces have achieved some sort cult status here america yet none have really reached mainstream success some have broken through barrier have gained acceptance with american critics like katsuhiro otomos akira or princess mononoke or spirited away both films directed by hayao miyazaki one that ive seen has been barely mentioned by most critics is grave fireflies what we have with grave fireflies is story innocence lost two children who ultimately face losing battle with trying survive small japanese village closing days world war ii wwii was costliest conflict world history with millions dead thousands left pick up pieces center it are aforementioned two children who are pretty much left fend themselves after their mother is killed bombing raid because their father is off fighting war they have no way contacting any other family theyre sent live with their aunt who is at first warm welcoming them but eventually becomes very cruel children are forced live nearby bomb shelter that point two children embark journey that is every bit as unpleasant difficult as grim realities world around them very easily one best anime films that ive ever seen or any animated film that matter i find it difficult believe just how truly overlooked grave fireflies is animation is beautiful though certainly not dated by any means even though japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made we get sense dread two lead characters who watch as world around them crumbles into heaps ashes aircraft loom ominously overhead dropping their deadly incendiary cargo unsuspecting japanese villagers director isao takahata obviously has special resentment war but manages avoid condemning it outright director instead lets us focus conflict as seen through eyes two children who watch unflinchingly as realities their world begin falter before them grave fireflies is bold statement condition human soul during conflict i probably shouldnt say this but i am anyways but this film has be schindlers list animated pieces its brave its not overly sentimental but it is relentless its dramatization dangerous reality it should be required viewing any high school world history class beautiful film not be missed by anyone,0.5248531746031746,0.10812878787878785,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.3, 'Fear': 0.28}"
10.0,"A masterpiece, whose beauty is often overlooked","When I watched this movie, I steeled myself for a traumatic experience, based on every review I'd ever read of it, which usually include phrases like ""don't watch this if you're suicidal."" Instead, if I had to pick a single word to sum up the movie I saw, it would probably be 'beautiful'.Certainly it was sad, and arguably depressing, but I've read this movie compared with 'Saving Private Ryan'. That's ridiculous. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is gentle and poetic more often than it's violent, and it's remarkably restrained in its anti-war message. It simply tells a story : there's very little at all in the way of moralizing or polemics. Why would a story like this need such heavy-handed tactics?I've also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it's revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead. I have a quite different view of that device.Firstly. the beginning of 'Fireflies' is, for all intents and purposes, a 'happy ending'. This is such a non-linear plot development that you could fail to notice it, and thereby only see the movie's gloom. The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko's hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment, it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come, as far as the viewer is concerned - is over, and they are together again (albeit still without parents).As for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie, this is a device which has been used in centuries if not Milena. The crucial thing here is that 'Fireflies' isn't _about_ tension. It tells a story whose ultimate conclusion you already know (a legitimate narrative approach), and everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with a foreknowledge of its ending. You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power. You know the characters are going to die, but you hope things won't be so bad in the meantime. It doesn't take much of an effort to make that an analogy for our own lives, which makes us all fireflies.Perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that it's so damn honest. I mean that: it's one of the most honest, artifice-free movies I've ever seen. It doesn't even really try to ram an anti-war message down your throat there is very little overt violence, and if there are some scenes of corpses and suffering, it's never gratuitous, and it's over quickly. Compare this with 'Private Ryan', where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts, only to reach a conclusion which, after much blood and thunder, signifies very little.'Fireflies', OTOH, has far more beauty than gore. This is what really surprised me about it. Probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn, tranquil rural or urban settings, with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality - even when the American bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal, almost serene sense to it - and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes.Perhaps best of all, Setsuko is one of the very, very few (if not the only) animated 4 year-old I've ever seen who actually _behaves_ like a four year old. I'm so sick of seeing preternaturally smart, sassy, sophisticated and precocious children in Hollywood movies. Setsuko's emotion and behaviors are _exactly_ right for a completely normal four year-old, and recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy. Similarly, Seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride, compassion and hubris which you'd expect of someone his age. He still believes that Japan will win the war he thinks it's up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where. This leads him to make mistakes: possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmer's advice, swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again. You would probably have to say his decision not to even try - to go it alone instead, was a very bad one, but - hello, people - here is a character who makes mistakes because he's actually human: a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation, who doesn't miraculously save the day, because his best judgment just isn't good enough.Of course, his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway. Who knows?Don't go into the film expecting tension, drama or even a tirade against war. It's a movie about the beauty and fragility of life and youth. If you think Japanese animation is all giant robots and superhuman schoolgirls, this could be the film which changes your mind. It's slow, poetic, beautiful and sad, and extraordinarily honest.I must be the only person who didn't cry during this film (and I mean, I get choked up during some Disney movies). Yes, it is sad, but its beauty and honesty is what I'll remember.NB: this review refers to the subtitled version of the film.",masterpiece whose beauty is often overlooked,when i watched this movie i steeled myself traumatic experience based every review id ever read it which usually include phrases like dont watch this if youre suicidal instead if i had pick single word sum up movie i saw it would probably be beautiful certainly it was sad arguably depressing but ive read this movie compared with saving private ryan thats ridiculous grave fireflies is gentle poetic more often than its violent its remarkably restrained its anti war message it simply tells story theres very little at all way moralizing or polemics why would story like this need such heavy handed tactics ive also read it argued that movie is robbed any suspense or impact when its revealed opening scene that main characters are dead i have quite different view that device firstly beginning fireflies is all intents purposes happy ending this is such non linear plot development that you could fail notice it thereby only see movies gloom moment where ghostly seita takes ghostly setsukos hand nods her is not only happy moment it signifies that suffering which is yet come as far as viewer is concerned is over they are together again albeit still without parents as character revealing that he is dead first line movie this is device which has been used centuries if not milena crucial thing here is that fireflies isnt about tension it tells story whose ultimate conclusion you already know legitimate narrative approach everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with foreknowledge its ending you find yourself hoping that things will go right now setsuko seita then knowledge that ultimately it wont undercuts you with real emotional power you know characters are going die but you hope things wont be so bad meantime it doesnt take much effort make that analogy our own lives which makes us all fireflies perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that its so damn honest i mean that its one most honest artifice free movies ive ever seen it doesnt even really try ram anti war message down your throat there is very little overt violence if there are some scenes corpses suffering its never gratuitous its over quickly compare this with private ryan where you have suffer through 40 minutes most horrific blood guts only reach conclusion which after much blood thunder signifies very little fireflies otoh has far more beauty than gore this is what really surprised me about it probably two thirds movie takes place gorgeously drawn tranquil rural or urban settings with almost pleasant dreamlike quality even when american bombers are flying overhead at one point there is surreal almost serene sense it there are plenty moments happiness offset undeniably sadness frustration other scenes perhaps best all setsuko is one very very few if not only animated 4 year old ive ever seen who actually behaves like four year old im so sick seeing preternaturally smart sassy sophisticated precocious children hollywood movies setsukos emotion behaviors are exactly right completely normal four year old recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy similarly seita is teenage boy who behaves with sort mixture pride compassion hubris which youd expect someone his age he still believes that japan will win war he thinks its up him take care his sister with their mother gone father who knows where this leads him make mistakes possibly most obvious one being where he fails take farmers advice swallow his pride ask his nasty aunt take them back again you would probably have say his decision not even try go it alone instead was very bad one but hello people here is character who makes mistakes because hes actually human believable teenage boy extraordinary situation who doesnt miraculously save day because his best judgment just isnt good enough course his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway who knows dont go into film expecting tension drama or even tirade against war its movie about beauty fragility life youth if you think japanese animation is all giant robots superhuman schoolgirls this could be film which changes your mind its slow poetic beautiful sad extraordinarily honest i must be only person who didnt cry during this film i mean i get choked up during some disney movies yes it is sad but its beauty honesty is what ill remember nb this review refers subtitled version film,0.5958212868480725,0.08176321570294783,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.31}"
,Powerful and Heartbreaking,"""September 21, 1945...That was the night I died.""-- SeitaReading war statistics and even seeing bloody images on television does not fully communicate the horror of war as well as the heartbreaking Grave of the Fireflies, an anime feature directed by Isao Takahata, a long-time colleague of Hayao Miyazaki. The film tells the story of two children, Seita, a 14-year old boy and Setsuko, his 4-year old sister and their uphill struggle to survive the effects of American firebombing in Kobe near the end of World War II. Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave is a powerful experience that powerfully communicates the strength of the human spirit to carry on against overwhelming odds. Though despairing, the film does not resort to cheap melodrama to achieve its effect but delineates simple and direct images that are not watered-down to appeal to the children's market. It would indeed be too sad for most children under 13. In an interview with Cedric Littardi, AnimeLand magazine from 1992, Takahata said that he did not set out to depress the audience but to show a natural death, as opposed to a ""scientific"" death, the way most of us view it -- behind closed curtains in a sanitized hospital. Takahata in some ways softens the impact of the tragedy at the outset by showing Seita dying outside a subway station and his spirit reunited with his little sister Setsuko. The story is told by flashback as the two children are left alone to fend for themselves when their mother is killed in the bombing campaign. When their father is also killed in the Navy, they must struggle against starvation, the cruelty of an aunt they trusted, people's general indifference, and their own pride. Though both children eventually succumb to malnutrition (or radiation poisoning), the animation is so lyrical that it creates a magical, dream-like effect. This does not mask the tragedy but makes it all the more poignant. Nothing sums up the message of this film better than the beautiful poem, ""I Come and Stand at Every Door"" by Nazim Hikmat, one of the most important and influential figures in 20th-century Turkish literature. I come and stand at every door. But no one hears my silent tread. I knock and yet remain unseen. For I am dead, for I am dead.I'm only seven although I died. In Hiroshima long ago. I'm seven now as I was then. When children die they do not grow.My hair was scorched by swirling flame. My eyes grew dim, my eyes grew blind. Death came and turned my bones to dust. And that was scattered by the wind.I need no fruit, I need no rice. I need no sweet, nor even bread. I ask for nothing for myself. For I am dead, for I am dead.All that I ask is that for peace. You fight today, you fight today. So that the children of this world. May live and grow and laugh and play.	-- Nazim HikmetIn our day where our leaders are busily preparing for another war, it is important to remember the human cost of these plans and the untold suffering they will inevitably bring.

I hesitated at first, but then I said ""Oh well, I'll give it a try."" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I've ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn't trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.I am kind of upset, that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.An Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.Quite Simply 10/10",beautiful unforgettable masterpiece that shows true cost war,i decided watch grave fireflies yesterday my friends told me it was extremely moving sad i hesitated at first but then i said oh well ill give it try at end film i was crying my eyes out this was best animated film ive ever seen this is moving depiction fates cast off children who become casualties war this movie isnt your regular animated film pixar disney put films out there with happy endings im not saying there bad films at all they are also great pieces work but grave fireflies tells you truth this movie isnt trying entertain you it wants inform you about how war is really like there were many moments movie that just brought me tears i am kind upset that this movie didnt get many awards as it should that regards it is very underrated it is kind thrown apart when it should really be respected praise it if this movie was made our time period right now i would be 100 sure this would won oscar best animated film this is studio ghilbis best movie they have ever released i truly advice you bring handkerchief cause chances are that you will cry emotional epic animated film that i recommend everyone watch quite simply 10 10,0.5860238967381824,0.3110969387755102,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.27}"
,One of the finest films ever made.,"Occasionally there's a film that literally changes one's perceptions of the world. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is one of those films. No movie ever made generates such an intense and powerful emotional response as this one.It's an animated film set in Japan during the closing days of World War II. Two children; a boy named Seita and his much younger sister Setsuko; must quickly learn to cope with life after their mother is killed during a fire-bombing raid by American B-29's. The film starts with the children and their mother preparing for the attack, then follows the children as they attempt to survive the death of their mother, and the possible death of their father, a naval officer serving aboard the Japanese heavy cruiser 'Maya.' (A US submarine torpedoed the 'Maya' in late October of 1944 during the battle of Leyte Gulf.)The story of two orphans trying to survive in war-ravaged Japan is not the subject of your typical light-hearted animated film. In fact it may be much too serious for anyone under the age of 14. The first five minutes of the film hits one like a sledgehammer - by far the most emotional opening scene I've ever come across. I found myself already reaching for the tissues, and trying to choke back the tears.Yet there's more than just tragedy in 'Grave of the Fireflies.' It is the most awesome love story one is ever likely to see. But it's far from the typical Hollywood idea of a love story. Instead of the usual highly attractive Hollywood actors of the opposite sex pining for one another in front of the camera, we have an animated Japanese brother and his much younger little sister. It's not a tale of romantic love, but one of 'brotherly' love.Seita loves his little sister, and once he discovers that his mother has been killed in the bombing, he does everything he can to keep his sister from finding out about her horrible death. Then, with typical Japanese seriousness, he begins to immediately provide for and comfort Setsuko; she being the only member of his immediate family he has left. Though not stated in the film, it seems obvious that part of Seita's motivation for looking so carefully after his sister has to do with avoiding his own pain and despair having been left with NOTHING after the bombing attack. No mother, no father, no home. The war Japan is waging against the rest of the world takes its toll on these two little ones, without regard for their feelings or emotions.That which truly broke my heart into ten thousand tiny pieces was the selfless way Seita looked after his younger sister, and shielded her from the horrors all around, especially the lack of food. Films show us many things, some good, some evil, but rarely has any film shown how one person so unselfishly puts another ahead of them self. Seita does makes some mistakes in the way he goes about taking care of his sister, but I can't fault him for his love and his devotion. Who of us have always chosen the best path, the most perfect way of doing things? Surely not I! Seita's obvious love and devotion to Setsuko is the most moving and convicting thing I've ever come across on film.I use the word 'convicting' because this movie convicted me of my own very selfish nature. 'Grave of the Fireflies' caused me sadness not just because of Seita's brave attempts to take care of his little sister; but because he gave of himself so totally and completely, even though his sister was a liability to his own survival. I could not help to be convicted concerning all the many times there have been family and friends who have needed my help or understanding, but I ignored them in favor of 'doing my own thing.' How sad I am for all those times I've ignored the suffering of others and their cries for help. This film showed the evil in my own heart - something that I would not have noticed on my own. But now that the blinders have been removed, I can repent of my selfishness, and look for ways to help others, instead of avoiding them.Some Japanese anime I've seen are very much anti-American. But even though it's the Americans dropping the bombs in this film, there is no overt anti-American message. In many ways, the Japanese civilians are shown in as bad a light as is the American air and naval forces! Their hard hearts and stubborn ways are displayed on the screen without apology; and one can see how the plight of the two children is made even worst by the selfishness of the adults that they have come to rely upon.It would be easy for someone from 'the West' (i.e. The USA, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, etc.) to think that the two children depicted in this animated marvel were the exception, rather than the rule. They lived in very trying times, and surely children in this day and age do not have to go through experiences similar to Seita's and Setsuko's. Unfortunately, that's not the case. There are still major problems with orphans and unwanted children in the former communist block countries of Eastern Europe and Russia itself. There are also large numbers of unwanted children roaming the streets of China, India, Mongolia, and various other Asian nations. We may not here about it on the news, or hear our friends talk about it; but I assure you that there are literally millions of children around the world whose situation is no better, if not much worst than that of Seita and Setsuko.I am very thankful I had the honor of watching this film. I'm also very thankful for the people who put it together. But most of all, I'm very thankful for the positive impact it has had on my life.",one finest films ever made,occasionally theres film that literally changes ones perceptions world grave fireflies is one those films no movie ever made generates such intense powerful emotional response as this one its animated film set japan during closing days world war ii two children boy named seita his much younger sister setsuko must quickly learn cope with life after their mother is killed during fire bombing raid by american b 29s film starts with children their mother preparing attack then follows children as they attempt survive death their mother possible death their father naval officer serving aboard japanese heavy cruiser maya us submarine torpedoed maya late october 1944 during battle leyte gulf story two orphans trying survive war ravaged japan is not subject your typical light hearted animated film fact it may be much too serious anyone under age 14 first five minutes film hits one like sledgehammer by far most emotional opening scene ive ever come across i found myself already reaching tissues trying choke back tears yet theres more than just tragedy grave fireflies it is most awesome love story one is ever likely see but its far typical hollywood idea love story instead usual highly attractive hollywood actors opposite sex pining one another front camera we have animated japanese brother his much younger little sister its not tale romantic love but one brotherly love seita loves his little sister once he discovers that his mother has been killed bombing he does everything he can keep his sister finding out about her horrible death then with typical japanese seriousness he begins immediately provide comfort setsuko she being only member his immediate family he has left though not stated film it seems obvious that part seitas motivation looking so carefully after his sister has do with avoiding his own pain despair having been left with nothing after bombing attack no mother no father no home war japan is waging against rest world takes its toll these two little ones without regard their feelings or emotions that which truly broke my heart into ten thousand tiny pieces was selfless way seita looked after his younger sister shielded her horrors all around especially lack food films show us many things some good some evil but rarely has any film shown how one person so unselfishly puts another ahead them self seita does makes some mistakes way he goes about taking care his sister but i cant fault him his love his devotion who us have always chosen best path most perfect way doing things surely not i seitas obvious love devotion setsuko is most moving convicting thing ive ever come across film i use word convicting because this movie convicted me my own very selfish nature grave fireflies caused me sadness not just because seitas brave attempts take care his little sister but because he gave himself so totally completely even though his sister was liability his own survival i could not help be convicted concerning all many times there have been family friends who have needed my help or understanding but i ignored them favor doing my own thing how sad i am all those times ive ignored suffering others their cries help this film showed evil my own heart something that i would not have noticed my own but now that blinders have been removed i can repent my selfishness look ways help others instead avoiding them some japanese anime ive seen are very much anti american but even though its americans dropping bombs this film there is no overt anti american message many ways japanese civilians are shown as bad light as is american air naval forces their hard hearts stubborn ways are displayed screen without apology one can see how plight two children is made even worst by selfishness adults that they have come rely upon it would be easy someone west i e usa canada western europe australia etc think that two children depicted this animated marvel were exception rather than rule they lived very trying times surely children this day age do not have go through experiences similar seitas setsukos unfortunately thats not case there are still major problems with orphans unwanted children former communist block countries eastern europe russia itself there are also large numbers unwanted children roaming streets china india mongolia various other asian nations we may not here about it news or hear our friends talk about it but i assure you that there are literally millions children around world whose situation is no better if not much worst than that seita setsuko i am very thankful i had honor watching this film im also very thankful people who put it together but most all im very thankful positive impact it has had my life,0.5276073068345795,0.10967325855962214,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.26}"
10.0,Soul Breaking,"This is a film about the sad reality of war. When war is waged, we often think of it as this army against that army. Lost in the mix are the civilians who die horrible deaths--not just from the weapons of war but from disease and starvation. We give great power to the power structure that makes the decision to wage conflict. Often their words sound good and we embrace those words. This film shows what happens to a small, seemingly insignificant pair of children, trying to get a roof over their heads and have a bit to eat. Their mother has been killed in a fire bombing and their father is in the Japanese navy. It shows the efforts to maintain dignity and the cruelty of those who could help but don't. Japan paid a huge price for trying to expand the Empire. The leadership convinced the populace that they were driven by a higher power that wanted them to crush their enemies at whatever cost. But here we see the price. Fire bombings, air raids, and, of course, eventually Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is the saddest of stories, shown in spotless animation.

8.0,A magnificent piece of work and one of the most heartbreaking tales ever told,"Animation is often seen as a childish medium, and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.I'm not a big fan of animation, but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant, and this is one of those films. The animation is beautiful and certain scenes, including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art. The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful, and helps add to the tragedy of the story. Because we are able to care for the characters, the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one, but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair. The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched, let alone animated pictures. The fact that it's so plain and blatant, with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion.This film is a must see.",magnificent piece work one most heartbreaking tales ever told,animation is often seen as childish medium good reason as kids films often are animated however every now then animated film comes along that extends its boundaries manages deliver very adult story grave fireflies is one those films through its well observed very real characters grave fireflies portrays story loss heartbreak effect war civilians manner that is more effective more firmly based reality than many live action films about same subject are we follow seita setsuko brother sister that have lost their parents war are now forced fend themselves war torn country how two go about doing that boys development child somewhat responsible adult due change surroundings makes up spine movie im not big fan animation but there are some films that are so great that persons personal preferences are irrelevant this is one those films animation is beautiful certain scenes including air raids anything with fireflies are amazing works art way music blends with images screen is haunting beautiful helps add tragedy story because we are able care characters tragedy is increased ten fold story whole is sad one but few movies have ever matched up this films ending terms pure despair conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching extent that few movies have ever matched let alone animated pictures fact that its so plain blatant with no attempt console audience takes tragedy whole new level i dont doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon films conclusion this film is must see,0.4956451272304931,0.1801303980572273,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.36}"

10.0,The best movie you'll never want to see again,"I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago. It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions. At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up. It would've seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.I've made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn't moved (usually to tears) by this movie, you've found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.There are many other reviews of this movie, and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I'll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.When you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper, think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened, and your eyes opened a bit more.I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to ""decompress"" after watching it.

10.0,Heartbreaking...,"This film proves without any doubt that animation isn't just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seito and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.The story itself, based on a true story, is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama, along the lines of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun or even Schindler's List. However, the Studio Ghibli team, have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters, but especially the young siblings. Now we're not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic, they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans, large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental, but coupled with the characters movements and actions, it gives the characters such a strong, and very human, presence. You truly care for these kids, which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.It is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves, just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.The greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness, it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don't need to see anymore. Another of it's strengths is that it really doesn't comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.This is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren't moved by these characters, you really need to check your pulse. 10/10",heartbreaking,this film proves without any doubt that animation isnt just suited tales fantasy sci fi or cartoon comedy violence this absolutely heartbreaking japanese anime tells story young boy seito his younger sister setsuko as they attempt survive american bombings japan last year world war ii story itself based true story is powerful enough but decision animate film truly elevates this film higher level this would have been powerful enough live action drama along lines spielbergs empire sun or even schindlers list however studio ghibli team have brought extraordinary amount life all characters but especially young siblings now were not talking realism as such here characters are no way photo realistic they do have usual characteristics japanese anime humans large eyes exaggerated expressions what this achieves however is heightened level subtle nuances expression which are arguably more powerful provocative than anything real life actor may achieve some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental but coupled with characters movements actions it gives characters such strong very human presence you truly care these kids which is astonishing achievement voice cast original japanese contributes significantly here also it is tiny moments which give this film so much power emotional depth subtle expressions brief scenes showing seito playing with his sister at bath time attempting unsuccessfully cheer her up when she misses her mother painted backgrounds are works art themselves just beautiful course scenes with fireflies bring touch pure magic heightened innocent reality contrast horrific realities war greatest achievement this film is that apart couple obviously sentimental scenes such as setsukos sobbing or illness it doesnt force any false emotion viewer it really comes your involvement with characters its completely honest its own story even cuts off scenes abruptly which could potentially have been milked cheap sentiment it often seems say this is what happened you dont need see anymore another its strengths is that it really doesnt comment politics war any way just effects innocent people this is intensely moving film masterpiece animation if you arent moved by these characters you really need check your pulse 10 10,0.5779701372074255,0.14163731748477512,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.41}"

Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and ""depressing"" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty.

10.0,"a combination of Rome Open City and Wiesel's Night (and like both, an extreme, personally felt story)","In 1988 Grave of the Fireflies was placed on a double-bill alongside My Neighbor Totoro. Two of the most endearing films ever created- animated of otherwise- were paired alongside one another, more than likely to balance each other out; after being submersed in a pure tale of innocence and delight like Miyazaki's great film, there could be accepted such a bleak, heartbreaking story of survival. And both films, incidentally, were based on true experiences, and while Miyazaki's story wasn't without some sadness in real life (his mother was really sick with TB in the hospital), Akiyuki Nosaka's story is one drenched in the worst horrors imaginable for a child. It's basically about two siblings, an older brother and younger sister, who are left practically orphans in a Japan completely devastated by the constant barrage of bombs falling all around, and with very little hope in sight. This lays the groundwork for their relationship, a bond very fragile and incredibly endearing.Not since Rossellini and De Sica had a filmmaker, in this case Isao Takahata, touched a nerve so deeply etched out in deconstructing the horrors of wartime. By leaving us with these two characters, who piece by piece are stripped of their innocence in just the simple task of fending for themselves in a shelter (they at first stay with an aunt who considers them freeloaders) and scrounging for food any way possible, we're left with nothing else but their struggle, essentially. The backdrop itself almost becomes abstract, something so huge that we don't even know that it's Americans dropping the bombs, as it's already too much to grasp that a child's parent is no longer with them. Like Elie Wiesel's book Night, the backdrop and horror is used to pit these people in an untenable situation, and it can only end, honestly, without compromise.So, indeed, Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell, but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters, and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature (though, ironically, as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD, the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films). The animation is exceptionally refined without being excessive in violence; images are visceral for just what is briefly revealed, without the extraneous shots that one might see in a work not meant in a G-rated film (i.e. when Seita sees her mother, dead and wrapped in bandages with the maggots and bugs crawling all over), and at the same time there's a sense of wonderment as the two children watch the fireflies in the shelter. The voice-work, too, doesn't strain credulity- these sound like, if it were a regular live-action feature, the kids who would play these parts (and, speaking of neo-realism, the two credited for Seita and Setsuko never worked before or again).Most often, the film is heart-rending because of how things build with the situation. It's tragic enough to see the loss of the mother on the son, but then to hide it from the little girl becomes a greater challenge. Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back, it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters, such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time, or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko. And, finally, there's the last ten or so minutes, which I won't mention here. Suffice to say it's one of those times in movies where the opening of the film- Seiko dying homeless and famished- is explained to a perfect degree by film's end. It's a harrowing experience, and one of the very best animated films.",combination rome open city wiesels night like both extreme personally felt story,1988 grave fireflies was placed double bill alongside my neighbor totoro two most endearing films ever created animated otherwise were paired alongside one another more than likely balance each other out after being submersed pure tale innocence delight like miyazakis great film there could be accepted such bleak heartbreaking story survival both films incidentally were based true experiences while miyazakis story wasnt without some sadness real life his mother was really sick with tb hospital akiyuki nosakas story is one drenched worst horrors imaginable child its basically about two siblings older brother younger sister who are left practically orphans japan completely devastated by constant barrage bombs falling all around with very little hope sight this lays groundwork their relationship bond very fragile incredibly endearing not since rossellini de sica had filmmaker this case isao takahata touched nerve so deeply etched out deconstructing horrors wartime by leaving us with these two characters who piece by piece are stripped their innocence just simple task fending themselves shelter they at first stay with aunt who considers them freeloaders scrounging food any way possible were left with nothing else but their struggle essentially backdrop itself almost becomes abstract something so huge that we dont even know that its americans dropping bombs as its already too much grasp that childs parent is no longer with them like elie wiesels book night backdrop horror is used pit these people untenable situation it can only end honestly without compromise so indeed grave fireflies is bleak as hell but compelling because it doesnt stray its path with these characters that many scenes were connected them without overbearing heart tugs common disney feature though ironically as ebert points out interview with dvd big eyes most anime is based upon those early disney films animation is exceptionally refined without being excessive violence images are visceral just what is briefly revealed without extraneous shots that one might see work not meant g rated film i e when seita sees her mother dead wrapped bandages with maggots bugs crawling all over at same time theres sense wonderment as two children watch fireflies shelter voice work too doesnt strain credulity these sound like if it were regular live action feature kids who would play these parts speaking neo realism two credited seita setsuko never worked before or again most often film is heart rending because how things build with situation its tragic enough see loss mother son but then hide it little girl becomes greater challenge each time layer emotional defense is peeled back it becomes harder not connect strongly with these characters such as when seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries fireflies seita finally cries out first time or when seita is left broken humiliated after being beat up by farmer stealing food sick setsuko finally theres last ten or so minutes which i wont mention here suffice say its one those times movies where opening film seiko dying homeless famished is explained perfect degree by films end its harrowing experience one very best animated films,0.5050915750915751,0.05284239162663819,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.42}"

10.0,Brutally honest and heartbreaking,"Being my first Anime review I thought I'd start off with my one of my favourite pieces of work from who else but Studio Ghibli. Ghibli have rarely produced anime that doesn't fall short of great but Graveyard is something different indeed.Set in the aftermath of World War II, Graveyard is focused on the lives of a caring brother and his young sister (Setsuko and Seita) and how they struggle against both the elements of wartime and a depreciating Japanese empire. The most striking thing about Graveyard is probably how real everything seems. The animation is very unconventional to the likes of say Spirited Away or Laputa but in a good way. The horror of war is beautifully realised through the animation, whether it be the American destruction being shown or the bleak outlook on peoples lives, namely the two main characters. Thankfully it earns every shred of emotion it conveys through these two sympathetic characters that only the coldest of hearts wouldn't warm up to. Avoiding any Hollywood sentimentality, it is often a bleak and depressing perspective depicted but all the more brutally powerful in the process. With my eyes welling up through the duration of the film, it occured to me just how well the Director understands what raw heartfelt emotion is and how to play the audiences heart strings. Nevertheless nothing is shown in a heavy handed approach, no empthasis is put on the Americans nor is there any special attention taken to the war details. If anything the citizens of Japan are shown in the coldest light often giving little help to the plight of others, but demonstrating furthermore what desperate situation everyone is in.Takahata instead decides to focus on the plight of it's title characters against the background of war. With the empire of Japan in crisis and food shortages everywhere it is heart breaking to see a brother struggle to meet ends meet for his sister. Due to the approach taken it borders on being horrifying but fortunately the tone is changed with the spirit put into Setsuko's character. Much like 'The Pianist' the issue is not the war but the struggle and will to survive in it. This is clearly displayed in a plot that revolves around the downward spiral Setsuko trying to feed himself and more importantly the younger and more vulnerable sister Seita. The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title), is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly. It's the perfect mixture of such animation, realistic and highly likeable characters that makes the whole film one tearful experience. Dealing with such difficult issues it's very hard to imagine this being a film and if it was I don't think it would of been done as well.Part of the brilliance also comes from symbology and the association to many different worlds in such a understanding depiction. The child, Seita, is nothing short of perfection in child like behaviour happily oblivious to the desperate situation, amusing herself with simplicity and the quirks of nature and the outdoors. The older brother Setsuko who must carry the burdon of everything is also perfectly portrayed and to watch there decent is painful to say the least. To struggle is one thing but to have shock, shattered dreams and be depended on is something anyone can empthasise with. There may be some people who will shy away from Anime, disregarding it as a mere cartoon. To those people and everyone else I recommend Graveyard as the tonic, which can be appreciated by anyone with a heart and soul.

10.0,"Heartrendering, moving masterpiece from Isao Takahata, and a triumph for animation.","Truly one of Studio Ghibli's greatest crowning achievements, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is a brilliant masterpiece fully deserving of a place in any of the best movies ever made. Not just an astonishingly great (and, at the risk of coming off as cliché, perfect) work of art, this is a moving, thought-provoking, and ultimately heartbreaking tale about the loss of innocence and the tragedies of war.Based on an autobiography by Akiyuki Nosaka, the film, set during the bombing of Japan in --of all times-- World War II, centers on Seita, a loving, headstrong Navy soldier's son and his innocent little sister, Setsuko. Their fatal struggle for survival begins right at the start, when both are bombed out of house and home by American B-29s. Mom is seriously wounded and found wrapped in bandages at a hospital, where she dies shortly after. The children move to Nishinomiya to stay with their aunt. Auntie, a cold, bitter, self-serving woman, has no patience with Seita or Setsuko, especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight, play by the beach, or lounge around the house instead of helping out. After butting heads with Auntie long enough, the children decide to run away, setting up home in an abandoned cave by the lake. Both try by all means to live off of vegetables or whatever food they can afford to trade and/or steal, to no avail....The outcome of the story is actually showcased at the opening of the movie, where we see a ghostly specter of Seita watching a more malnourished version of himself die a painful, lonely death at a train station. Indeed, as we see how these events came to pass, we find ourselves rooting for Seita and Setsuko to find a way to stay alive, but alas, it is not to be, given Seita's stubborn pride. The overall tone of the movie is of a very tragic nature--even such lighthearted moments as the aforementioned sequences involving Seita and Setsuko playing around the house or gathering fireflies as lights for their cave are all tainted with a touch of sadness, for we know that these brief scenes of happiness will not last.Who is to blame for the plight of these children? The movie never addresses this question to the audience, nor does it really care to. It would be easy for director Isao Takahata to make this an anti-American movie, but he does better than that. Instead, he aptly conveys that war can spell serious--and deadly--consequences for victims. He also eschews casting any character as a hero or villain, and instead makes this a very human story, with no clear-cut ""good"" or ""bad"" characters. The aunt, for example, is not evil; she is merely an angry, desperate woman who is only struggling to survive just as much as Seita and Setsuko are. Atrocious as her treatment of the children is, we somehow never see her as a true baddie, but a very flawed, multi-faceted human being.Normally one would think of this kind of story as suitable for live-action, but GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES proves that it can be told through the art of animation as well. This is no mindless showcase of gorgeous visuals--although the artistic merits of the movie are, as with Ghibli productions, sumptuous and at times breathtaking--but a display of real characters struggling with very tangible emotions. And the most amazing accomplishment about this movie is how much we grow to care for Seita and Setsuko--their inseparable bond of love and companionship is the heart and soul behind the movie.There are long stretches of silence on the soundtrack, with music used very sparingly, yet the movie is all the more powerful for it. The most effective moment is where we hear a scratchy rendition of ""Home, Sweet Home"" over a montage of Setsuko playing by the shelter. It's a simplistic, sweet, yet very saddening moment that not only works in the context of the movie, but on its own as well.I don't normally say this in my reviews, but I would definitely recommend watching this movie in its native language of Japanese for a truly powerful and memorable experience. That's not to imply, however, that the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media, is inferior; on the contrary. It is, in fact, surprisingly good, with an effective lead in J. Robert Spencer and noteworthy cameo appearances by Anime voice-over actors Veronica Taylor, Crispin Freeman, and Dan Green. Rhoda Chrosite's Setsuko is the one voice that doesn't fare so well; she sounds more like an adult pretending to be a young girl, and comes across as strained during most scenes (save for when she is sick from diarrhea). Still, for those who can't read subtitles, the dub is more than adequate (although not as high-profile as others that I've heard).Even in a genre as multi-faceted as Japanese Anime, there are few films that literally everyone really MUST see. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is one such movie.",heartrendering moving masterpiece isao takahata triumph animation,truly one studio ghiblis greatest crowning achievements grave fireflies is brilliant masterpiece fully deserving place any best movies ever made not just astonishingly great at risk coming off as clich perfect work art this is moving thought provoking ultimately heartbreaking tale about loss innocence tragedies war based autobiography by akiyuki nosaka film set during bombing japan all times world war ii centers seita loving headstrong navy soldiers son his innocent little sister setsuko their fatal struggle survival begins right at start when both are bombed out house home by american b 29s mom is seriously wounded found wrapped bandages at hospital where she dies shortly after children move nishinomiya stay with their aunt auntie cold bitter self serving woman has no patience with seita or setsuko especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight play by beach or lounge around house instead helping out after butting heads with auntie long enough children decide run away setting up home abandoned cave by lake both try by all means live off vegetables or whatever food they can afford trade or steal no avail outcome story is actually showcased at opening movie where we see ghostly specter seita watching more malnourished version himself die painful lonely death at train station indeed as we see how these events came pass we find ourselves rooting seita setsuko find way stay alive but alas it is not be given seitas stubborn pride overall tone movie is very tragic nature even such lighthearted moments as aforementioned sequences involving seita setsuko playing around house or gathering fireflies as lights their cave are all tainted with touch sadness we know that these brief scenes happiness will not last who is blame plight these children movie never addresses this question audience nor does it really care it would be easy director isao takahata make this anti american movie but he does better than that instead he aptly conveys that war can spell serious deadly consequences victims he also eschews casting any character as hero or villain instead makes this very human story with no clear cut good or bad characters aunt example is not evil she is merely angry desperate woman who is only struggling survive just as much as seita setsuko are atrocious as her treatment children is we somehow never see her as true baddie but very flawed multi faceted human being normally one would think this kind story as suitable live action but grave fireflies proves that it can be told through art animation as well this is no mindless showcase gorgeous visuals although artistic merits movie are as with ghibli productions sumptuous at times breathtaking but display real characters struggling with very tangible emotions most amazing accomplishment about this movie is how much we grow care seita setsuko their inseparable bond love companionship is heart soul behind movie there are long stretches silence soundtrack with music used very sparingly yet movie is all more powerful it most effective moment is where we hear scratchy rendition home sweet home over montage setsuko playing by shelter its simplistic sweet yet very saddening moment that not only works context movie but its own as well i dont normally say this my reviews but i would definitely recommend watching this movie its native language japanese truly powerful memorable experience thats not imply however that english dub produced by new york based central park media is inferior contrary it is fact surprisingly good with effective lead j robert spencer noteworthy cameo appearances by anime voice over actors veronica taylor crispin freeman dan green rhoda chrosites setsuko is one voice that doesnt fare so well she sounds more like adult pretending be young girl comes across as strained during most scenes save when she is sick diarrhea still those who cant read subtitles dub is more than adequate although not as high profile as others that ive heard even genre as multi faceted as japanese anime there are few films that literally everyone really must see grave fireflies is one such movie,0.5632609771181197,0.16106050298907437,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10.0,One for the unknown victims.,"Just marvellous! This hearty masterpiece of Japanese animation is incredibly moving, sincere, haunting and captivating in detailing the special bond between brother and sister caught up in the horrifying and unforgiving face of war. It guides us on one really tragic, but rewarding trip where it truly has an impact. Never does it get overwrought or push itself onto the viewer, but still it manages to leave a lump in your throat and have you emotionally drained when the credits begin to roll. This one is not afraid to stay gloomy, and because you know the outcome at the beginning, this makes the significance of the story's journey more potentate in its increasing pain and devastation. By that alone, the wonderfully textured plot doesn't take the easy way out and the reality of the situation is never lost because it's animated.Staying simple and focused, kept it rather flawless in its in-depth story telling of emotional pride and lasting effects. Slow it might be, but there's too much subtle richness within its characters, premise and visuals to really bother about the loose pacing and lack of action. Isao Takahata adapts the novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, and gets us deeply involved with the civilians, and the mere war stays in the background. A contrast between two different worlds, one being the war itself and secondly the one the two children find themselves in to forget it. Namely those scenes where they're experiencing the beauty and freeness of nature (at if they might never get that chance again) and those sequences with the fireflies admirably paint the feelings of what's to come. The budding relationship between Seita and Setsuko is tremendously done, innocent and full of colour. Even capturing the Japanese citizens and families in this cold plight is believability achieved, as it throws questions, issues and metaphorical messages. These people (including our two central characters) are doing it hard, but their wills won't collapse after what they've been through, but things do take their toll when everything you ever care for can suddenly vanish and the heartache turns to utter numbness. Because what kept you living, is no longer there to hold you.Breathing heavily on the mood is the soft, lovely musical score that certainly weeps with its melodic tone. The vivid animation is gorgeously crisp and enchanting, and the background scenery is profoundly vivid and convincing. Many beautiful, striking illustrations are framed with a sincere touch, where darkness treads neatly together with the lighter moments. What a delightfully effective and soulful meditation piece of sublime art by director/writer Isao Takahata. This one has plenty to say on the topic at hand, and it gets even more relevant everyday.Magnificently heart-wrenching and sensitive war-time story on the people who find themselves dealing with the unbearable consequences of war.",one unknown victims,just marvellous this hearty masterpiece japanese animation is incredibly moving sincere haunting captivating detailing special bond between brother sister caught up horrifying unforgiving face war it guides us one really tragic but rewarding trip where it truly has impact never does it get overwrought or push itself onto viewer but still it manages leave lump your throat have you emotionally drained when credits begin roll this one is not afraid stay gloomy because you know outcome at beginning this makes significance storys journey more potentate its increasing pain devastation by that alone wonderfully textured plot doesnt take easy way out reality situation is never lost because its animated staying simple focused kept it rather flawless its depth story telling emotional pride lasting effects slow it might be but theres too much subtle richness within its characters premise visuals really bother about loose pacing lack action isao takahata adapts novel akiyuki nosaka gets us deeply involved with civilians mere war stays background contrast between two different worlds one being war itself secondly one two children find themselves forget it namely those scenes where theyre experiencing beauty freeness nature at if they might never get that chance again those sequences with fireflies admirably paint feelings whats come budding relationship between seita setsuko is tremendously done innocent full colour even capturing japanese citizens families this cold plight is believability achieved as it throws questions issues metaphorical messages these people including our two central characters are doing it hard but their wills wont collapse after what theyve been through but things do take their toll when everything you ever care can suddenly vanish heartache turns utter numbness because what kept you living is no longer there hold you breathing heavily mood is soft lovely musical score that certainly weeps with its melodic tone vivid animation is gorgeously crisp enchanting background scenery is profoundly vivid convincing many beautiful striking illustrations are framed with sincere touch where darkness treads neatly together with lighter moments what delightfully effective soulful meditation piece sublime art by director writer isao takahata this one has plenty say topic at hand it gets even more relevant everyday magnificently heart wrenching sensitive war time story people who find themselves dealing with unbearable consequences war,0.5949280251911832,0.17695038879249406,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.26, 'Fear': 0.28}"

10.0,"""Hard to recover from, impossible to forget""","This is one of those reviews where I will say at the outset that, if you haven't yet seen the film, you should go see it. As soon as (or even before, if you're the impatient type) you read this review, I urge you to run out and buy or rent it.Because my words simply cannot convey what Isao Takahata's animated masterpiece Hotaru no haka conveys.Known in the English-speaking world as Grave of the Fireflies or, in some countries, Tombstone for Fireflies, Hotaru no haka is the single most powerful anti-war film I have ever seen. As a work of art, it ranks among Picasso's Guernica and Elgar's cello concerto. It succeeds where many American filmslike Fahrenheit 9/11, Apocalypse Now, and even Schindler's Listsimply don't. Hotaru no haka is a grim depiction of innocence lost, not just of its two young protagonists, but of the entire Japanese nation.The story centers around two children: Seita, who is about thirteen; and his younger sister Setsuko, who is four. Their mother dies of wounds when their town is attacked during the firebombing of Japan in World War II, and they go to live with an aunt. While kind at first, she grows to resent the two siblings she must now feed and shelterwhy can't Seita ""work for the war effort,"" as his cousin and uncle are doing? Seita and Setsuko eventually set out on their own to live in an abandoned shelter. But food is hard to come by, and they gradually succumb to malnutrition.Yes, they die. That is obvious from the film's exposition, which shows Seita sitting ragged and obviously malnourished in a train station, a mysterious tin on his person. A janitor throws the tin into the night, where fireflies encircle it and the spirit of Setsuko emerges. She joins her brother's ghost, they board a train to the next world, and the story is told in flashback. ""September 21, 1945... that was the night I died"" is the opening line.The interesting thing about this film is that, although it is Japanese, it neither victimizes the Japanese nor demonizes the Americans. In fact, its deepest disdain is reserved perhaps for the Japanese people themselves, who turn a cold shoulder to the suffering of their children and fellow citizens. Takahata shows us that the true casualty of war is not life, but innocence.The animation, while in the stylized animé tradition, is rooted in realism and rich detail; and, while it strikingly depicts the tragic demise of the characters, it also has many moments of beauty. There is much to be admired visually in this filmhardly surprising, since it comes from Japan's legendary Studio Ghibli, which has produced the most breathtaking traditional animation that I have ever had the privilege to see.All these elementsstory, symbolism, animationcombine to make one big emotional punch in the gut that is hard to recover from and impossible to forget. It's an animated film, sure; but it is one of the most bitingly real films you'll ever see, and the simple fact that it is not live-action doesn't diminish its power. If you have a night to ruin, watch Hotaru no haka. It's a film that you don't want to see, but one that you will never regret having seen.My inevitable ""dub vs. sub"" commentary: The DVD contains two versions of the film: one is a dubbed English version, and the other is the original Japanese with English subtitles. I urge you to do yourself a favor, and watch the Japanese version. I see no point in watching the dub, since you won't be showing Hotaru no haka to younger children anyways....right?",hard recover impossible forget,this is one those reviews where i will say at outset that if you havent yet seen film you should go see it as soon as or even before if youre impatient type you read this review i urge you run out buy or rent it because my words simply cannot convey what isao takahatas animated masterpiece hotaru no haka conveys known english speaking world as grave fireflies or some countries tombstone fireflies hotaru no haka is single most powerful anti war film i have ever seen as work art it ranks among picassos guernica elgars cello concerto it succeeds where many american films like fahrenheit 9 11 apocalypse now even schindlers list simply dont hotaru no haka is grim depiction innocence lost not just its two young protagonists but entire japanese nation story centers around two children seita who is about thirteen his younger sister setsuko who is four their mother dies wounds when their town is attacked during firebombing japan world war ii they go live with aunt while kind at first she grows resent two siblings she must now feed shelter why cant seita work war effort as his cousin uncle are doing seita setsuko eventually set out their own live abandoned shelter but food is hard come by they gradually succumb malnutrition yes they die that is obvious films exposition which shows seita sitting ragged obviously malnourished train station mysterious tin his person janitor throws tin into night where fireflies encircle it spirit setsuko emerges she joins her brothers ghost they board train next world story is told flashback september 21 1945 that was night i died is opening line interesting thing about this film is that although it is japanese it neither victimizes japanese nor demonizes americans fact its deepest disdain is reserved perhaps japanese people themselves who turn cold shoulder suffering their children fellow citizens takahata shows us that true casualty war is not life but innocence animation while stylized anim tradition is rooted realism rich detail while it strikingly depicts tragic demise characters it also has many moments beauty there is much be admired visually this film hardly surprising since it comes japans legendary studio ghibli which has produced most breathtaking traditional animation that i have ever had privilege see all these elements story symbolism animation combine make one big emotional punch gut that is hard recover impossible forget its animated film sure but it is one most bitingly real films youll ever see simple fact that it is not live action doesnt diminish its power if you have night ruin watch hotaru no haka its film that you dont want see but one that you will never regret having seen my inevitable dub vs sub commentary dvd contains two versions film one is dubbed english version other is original japanese with english subtitles i urge you do yourself favor watch japanese version i see no point watching dub since you wont be showing hotaru no haka younger children anyways right,0.4756928697404888,0.10135710849996563,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.27}"
