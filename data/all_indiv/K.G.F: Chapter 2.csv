10,Paisa Vasool movie - KGF Chapter 2,"KGF Chapter 1 movie was just a Trailer, But this movie is a feast. Prashanth Neel kept his words and wrote such a Marvellous script. Some fools may say that KGF Chapter 2 is terrible, but being a movie lover I really loved the content. This really did well above the expectations and I really loved it. This movie is only made for action movie lovers only, Family sentiment and love story movie lovers will surely dislike due to it's action scenes. That's because these guys ain't have brain and Intelligence Quotient in their brain to understand this movie.

10,Expectations surpassed!,"""Hindi viewers, please don't regret later on when it'll be playing on TV and internet."" This is what I mentioned in my review of KGF Chapter 1 after I watched it in cinemas. And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.KGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky's character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn't really necessary).The biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.One thing I'd definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it's an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022.",expectations surpassed,hindi viewers please dont regret later when itll be playing tv internet this is what i mentioned my review kgf chapter 1 after i watched it cinemas today as i witnessed second chapter this epic action saga cinemas as well i found myself blown away by gripping plot gorgeous visuals stunning action sequences most importantly yashs screen presence as rocky i can safely proceed state that my expectations were not only met but also surpassed by this fine sequel kgf chapter 2 expands scale story introduced us part 1 ends up raising bar higher makers were definitely quite confident making it it shows every single frame beautifully picturizing kgf kolar gold fields explosively choreographing action sequences elevating rockys character at multiple occasions they have shown they knew what viewers wanted delivered promise product without any hassle i was also glad see heavy cheering whistling throughout almost entire duration some credit goes dialogue writer as well music was also good delivered without interfering with storytelling though one song second half wasnt really necessary biggest plus point film is its screenplay re introducing our favorite characters introducing new ones building up conflicts backing them with explosive action kgf chapter 2 has all ingredients proper mass entertainer not single scene where it feels dragged or overdone sure it does feel long at times but it never gets boring with several twists turns story remains intriguing till end one thing id definitely want tell viewers is not simply get up walk away once credits start rolling there is mid credits scene its important one other than that this film should be your watchlist if you like period action films end i just feel glad kind proud seeing film i liked 2018 going receive much bigger hype viewer turnout with its second part 2022,0.5128397679418086,0.1974622316459051,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.17, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.15, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.43}"

10,KGF - Chapter 2 is The Super-Duper Blockbuster Movie of 2022 !!!,"KGF - Chapter 1, set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down.The story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky's journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time.This film gets to showcase the emotional side of Rocky too, with a love story and even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition. The love story doesn't take away too much from the tale either. One of the best shots in the film is the introduction of Adheera played by Sanjay Dutt. It is pure magic on screen and evokes whistles organically. Raveena Tandon as the Prime Minister also has a good track. The other interesting addition is Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer. Prakash Raj also makes for a good narrator, with his baritone adding an immersive experience.The film belongs as much to filmmaker Prashanth Neel as it does to Yash. Both of them have managed to deliver a sequel that seems more immersive than the first part. Albeit, Prashanth has always maintained that the second part had the bigger chunk of his original story when they decided to break it into two parts.For the audience who wants to watch a loaded action film with style, heavy-duty stunts, and dialogues, this one is simply made to order. KGF: Chapter 2 might not appeal to the seemingly woke audience, who would question consent or nitpick on commercial staples like violence. But for those who love such films, here's an essential spoiler, as there is a hint at a possible third chapter in the end credits, so wait until the end.",kgf chapter 2 is super duper blockbuster movie 2022,kgf chapter 1 set tone slick gangster franchise high style details first part was all about establishing intentions power raja krishnappa bairya aka rocky bhai second part has managed create hype with its promotional content that gives peek into film does film manage match build up it does provides better sequel also has big surprise fans end too film begins with vijayendra ingalagi son anand ingalagi taking over as narrator rocky has won over people kgf he is now process dreaming bigger treading more dangerous paths this process he encounters adheera who is inspired by vikings evokes visceral fear who wants kgf back simultaneously he also has encounter righteous prime minister ramika sen who also wants rocky taken down story progresses at brisk pace racy tale rockys journey top film like first part presents dark dreary world that is stylishly shot while first part took time prove who protagonist was included more time establish same this second part moves quicker one gets meet more characters conflicts battles are more interesting this time this film gets showcase emotional side rocky too with love story even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition love story doesnt take away too much tale either one best shots film is introduction adheera played by sanjay dutt it is pure magic screen evokes whistles organically raveena tandon as prime minister also has good track other interesting addition is rao ramesh as cbi officer prakash raj also makes good narrator with his baritone adding immersive experience film belongs as much filmmaker prashanth neel as it does yash both them have managed deliver sequel that seems more immersive than first part albeit prashanth has always maintained that second part had bigger chunk his original story when they decided break it into two parts audience who wants watch loaded action film with style heavy duty stunts dialogues this one is simply made order kgf chapter 2 might not appeal seemingly woke audience who would question consent or nitpick commercial staples like violence but those who love such films heres essential spoiler as there is hint at possible third chapter end credits so wait until end,0.405868523510033,0.2047559149445942,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.13, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.27, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.33}"

5,"An improvement over the original in the technical aspects, but not the writing! [+53%]","K. G. F: Chapter 2 is a film that purely runs on technical finesse. There are impressively staged set-pieces, sophisticated production design, a pan-Indian (and possibly international) plot setup, and thumping background score. But the writing, something that didn't work for me in Chapter 1, is still very superficial. In Chapter 2, Rocky (Yash, with commanding screen presence) is no longer an underdog. He has already achieved legendary levels of notoriety with his deeds, even attracting the attention of the nation's Prime Minister. Prashanth Neel is great at crafting mass moments one after the other, in quick succession. The film, as a whole, is a carefully designed collection of mass moments - with frequent interludes of mother-son sentiment and a drab romance.In my review for Chapter 1, I'd hoped to see Srinidhi Shetty get at least a decent arc but alas, it's even worse than the first. Not only is she deemed mere entertainment for the protagonist, her only task in the film is to say the three magical words to the guy who's been holding her captive (Stockholm Syndrome max?). Okay, I get it. My bad to even think she'd have anything worthwhile to do in the film other than ""spoilers: die while pregnant"". The mother-son flashbacks are as weird as they can get - she whines and delivers a whole massy sermon to hospital personnel when her son is battling for life. I couldn't even buy the reason for Rocky's excessive greed - it's an attempt at painting him grey alright, but it's not written well. Neel shouldn't ever attempt family dramas or rom-coms. Like, ever.Sanjay Dutt's Adheera has got the look for sure, but the nature of his character is so utterly generic that he fails to rise above Chapter 1's Garuda. Raveena Tandon's PM Ramika Sen should have been the film's trump card, but the whole angle around her is played in the safest possible manner, giving Rocky a few more instances of elevation. The mass film tropes are scattered all over the place. But if you need a filmmaker to inventively visualize your action, Neel is the man you should call. Maybe, he can make a full-blown actioner (where the core focus is just on the action) without the build-ups, the monologues, or the exaggerated sentiments. I'd definitely buy a ticket to that film!",improvement over original technical aspects but not writing,k g f chapter 2 is film that purely runs technical finesse there are impressively staged set pieces sophisticated production design pan indian possibly international plot setup thumping background score but writing something that didnt work me chapter 1 is still very superficial chapter 2 rocky yash with commanding screen presence is no longer underdog he has already achieved legendary levels notoriety with his deeds even attracting attention nations prime minister prashanth neel is great at crafting mass moments one after other quick succession film as whole is carefully designed collection mass moments with frequent interludes mother son sentiment drab romance my review chapter 1 id hoped see srinidhi shetty get at least decent arc but alas its even worse than first not only is she deemed mere entertainment protagonist her only task film is say three magical words guy whos been holding her captive stockholm syndrome max okay i get it my bad even think shed have anything worthwhile do film other than spoilers die while pregnant mother son flashbacks are as weird as they can get she whines delivers whole massy sermon hospital personnel when her son is battling life i couldnt even buy reason rockys excessive greed its attempt at painting him grey alright but its not written well neel shouldnt ever attempt family dramas or rom coms like ever sanjay dutts adheera has got look sure but nature his character is so utterly generic that he fails rise above chapter 1s garuda raveena tandons pm ramika sen should have been films trump card but whole angle around her is played safest possible manner giving rocky few more instances elevation mass film tropes are scattered all over place but if you need filmmaker inventively visualize your action neel is man you should call maybe he can make full blown actioner where core focus is just action without build ups monologues or exaggerated sentiments id definitely buy ticket that film,0.552154195011338,0.09689018464528666,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.02, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.24, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.48}"

1,A 'mass' movie for low IQ people.,"I am from South India and I am used to a lot of so-called 'mass commercial' movies which have a ton of illogical heroism and gravity-defying fights which I really hate. The thing that set apart KGF 1 from those sorts of movies was the fact that the movie made sense and it did not really feel out of the world.I cannot say the same with KGF 2. It was so disappointing. The movie is nothing but hero worship throughout the span of the movie.Some scenes of this movie did not make any sense at all, they assumed that the viewers are of low IQ and not able to reason whatever they show in the movie.Some scenes like the hero using a helicopter as a fan for the heroine were so cringe! (BTW, who in the world dries pappad in front of a Bungalow!). Then there was this scene when the villain asks the doctor retrieving bullets from his body to keep a metal piece in his body to feel the pain! Bruh!The hero worship even goes to the baby hero! There is a scene towards the end of the movie when the hero's mom takes a baby hero to a hospital with pneumonia. The doctor instructs her to take the child to a better hospital in the city, to which she responds with some heroic dialogue as if it is a super baby! It was so cringy.The heroine character is useless in this movie. Just for the sake of the tradition of Indian movies that there should be a heroine! There is no use for her in the storyline at all, both in KGF 1 and 2! When the villain killed her, I was actually glad that I do not have to see her cringe scenes again!After the villain is killed in the movie, the hero's enemy is the Government of India. They made it look like India is some third-world country with a clownish military! Beyond this point, the hero himself was acting more like a terrorist and I really would have felt better if he was killed! Because he was led by nothing but selfishness to keep the so-called 'promise' he gave to his late mom! He becomes akin to the villain of KGF 1. He does not care about the people who work under him and constantly pushes them to dig more and more gold!There is a scene where the mentor of the hero questions him about the purpose of what he is doing and how he is any different from Garuda. (KGF 1 villain). The response from the hero is something lame inline of the promise he has to keep and for that he will do whatever it takes! All of a sudden, everyone's mind is changed and they are Ok with whatever he is doing!Some other things which I noted are that everyone has a gun in the movie unless and until there is a fight with the hero. In that case, they will come running with some knives and axes! And the hero conveniently takes one of them and stabs everyone else to death!The BGM used in this movie was nowhere near KGF 1 and I never felt any goosebumps! BGM was not cleverly used in this movie.The much-discussed black screens during some shots also felt really weird!Whatsoever, the movie has grossed some 1000 Crores or more and it shows how a movie does not have to be really good or logical to be a blockbuster. It only has to please the majority. These sorts of movies are generally meant for the low IQ audience and children who doesn't question the logic behind the scenes and the storyline. And it has worked.Whoever sharing any opinions against this movie are being canceled here in India and being called an anti-national!",mass movie low iq people,i am south india i am used lot so called mass commercial movies which have ton illogical heroism gravity defying fights which i really hate thing that set apart kgf 1 those sorts movies was fact that movie made sense it did not really feel out world i cannot say same with kgf 2 it was so disappointing movie is nothing but hero worship throughout span movie some scenes this movie did not make any sense at all they assumed that viewers are low iq not able reason whatever they show movie some scenes like hero using helicopter as fan heroine were so cringe btw who world dries pappad front bungalow then there was this scene when villain asks doctor retrieving bullets his body keep metal piece his body feel pain bruh hero worship even goes baby hero there is scene towards end movie when heros mom takes baby hero hospital with pneumonia doctor instructs her take child better hospital city which she responds with some heroic dialogue as if it is super baby it was so cringy heroine character is useless this movie just sake tradition indian movies that there should be heroine there is no use her storyline at all both kgf 1 2 when villain killed her i was actually glad that i do not have see her cringe scenes again after villain is killed movie heros enemy is government india they made it look like india is some third world country with clownish military beyond this point hero himself was acting more like terrorist i really would have felt better if he was killed because he was led by nothing but selfishness keep so called promise he gave his late mom he becomes akin villain kgf 1 he does not care about people who work under him constantly pushes them dig more more gold there is scene where mentor hero questions him about purpose what he is doing how he is any different garuda kgf 1 villain response hero is something lame inline promise he has keep that he will do whatever it takes all sudden everyones mind is changed they are ok with whatever he is doing some other things which i noted are that everyone has gun movie unless until there is fight with hero that case they will come running with some knives axes hero conveniently takes one them stabs everyone else death bgm used this movie was nowhere near kgf 1 i never felt any goosebumps bgm was not cleverly used this movie much discussed black screens during some shots also felt really weird whatsoever movie has grossed some 1000 crores or more it shows how movie does not have be really good or logical be blockbuster it only has please majority these sorts movies are generally meant low iq audience children who doesnt question logic behind scenes storyline it has worked whoever sharing any opinions against this movie are being canceled here india being called anti national,0.44399224806201554,0.03507751937984496,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.01, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.36, 'Fear': 0.24}"

1,What's more overrated than this movie ? Nothing.,Finally decided to watch the second part after all the hype even after finding first part to be just average. Thought the director might have actually improved but ohh no i was so wrong it's worse now.The movie starts with the entry of our Rocking Star Yash with a BGM and they Forgotted to off that BGM throught the film. BGM plays on throughout the whole movie yeah it's good but after one points it's just unbearable and can cause headache even during normal talking scenes there is a BGM. Then the film proceeds to have 20 more entry scenes of Yash till the end of the movie. Everyone comes praises Rocky then disappear oh gosh. The second half bores you in place of being entertaining specially during romantic scenes which you seriously don't care about. The romance seems very forced just to make Rocky Bhai furious enough to kill Adheera.The action sequences are just as poorly edited as the first part the most awkward is the car chase scene where it continuously blacks out for no reason dude show it clearly it's a action movie after all. The action in other parts is also medicore and again fast paced with many cuts. The supporting actors are there just for the sake of it. Sanjay Dutt is wasted with very minimum screen time and no character depth at all you know already he would get defeated by Rocky Bhai easily. Raveena is decent in her role but again not much importance given to her . Plus the movie is filled with many absurd scenes which don't make any sense.Overall the second part is even worse than first and only cinematography can't save a bad film infact i founded the first part to have better colours and better frames than this. How are people calling this mess a masterpiece is beyond my understanding. It's just too much to take. Chapter 3 is also coming which I'm not even tiny bit interested about after this movie's experience.,whats more overrated than this movie nothing,finally decided watch second part after all hype even after finding first part be just average thought director might have actually improved but ohh no i was so wrong its worse now movie starts with entry our rocking star yash with bgm they forgotted off that bgm throught film bgm plays throughout whole movie yeah its good but after one points its just unbearable can cause headache even during normal talking scenes there is bgm then film proceeds have 20 more entry scenes yash till end movie everyone comes praises rocky then disappear oh gosh second half bores you place being entertaining specially during romantic scenes which you seriously dont care about romance seems very forced just make rocky bhai furious enough kill adheera action sequences are just as poorly edited as first part most awkward is car chase scene where it continuously blacks out no reason dude show it clearly its action movie after all action other parts is also medicore again fast paced with many cuts supporting actors are there just sake it sanjay dutt is wasted with very minimum screen time no character depth at all you know already he would get defeated by rocky bhai easily raveena is decent her role but again not much importance given her plus movie is filled with many absurd scenes which dont make any sense overall second part is even worse than first only cinematography cant save bad film infact i founded first part have better colours better frames than this how are people calling this mess masterpiece is beyond my understanding its just too much take chapter 3 is also coming which im not even tiny bit interested about after this movies experience,0.45090745732255166,0.07107816711590298,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"

Loud background music gave me a headache. It's not art. It's business that has profited by exploiting low IQ teenage emotions by showing romance and action.

8,The perfect mass masala superstar vehicle!,"OMG. What did I just watch! KGF Chapter 2 is a blistering, adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes sequel to what was an era-defining part 1 that propelled not just Prashant Neel and superstar Yash but also the entire Kannada film industry, into national prominence. The team has clearly made the best use of the higher budget it received after the first film's success, keeping the emotional resonance from the original intact and building elaborate, well written and intelligently shot and edited mass elevation scenes that will keep you clamouring for more till the awe-inspiring climax.We rejoin our hero, Rocky Bhai as he takes over control of the Kolar Gold Fields after having killed the demonic ""Garuda"" in the first film, only to have an entire can of worms open up as a consequence with everyone ranging from Garuda's vengeful uncle ""Adheera"" (Sanjay Dutt) to the Prime Minister of India ""Ravika"" (Raveena Tandon) training their sights on his lucrative fiefdom. Director Prashant Neel gets his casting choices spot on with both these Bollywood biggies bringing in their A-game as menacing antagonists that hold their own against Yash's sheer swag and star power.The void left by legendary Kannada actor Anand Nat opting not to return to the franchise due to personal reasons was ably filled by National-award winner Prakash Raj, while the rest of the returning cast play their roles with flourish, especially Ayyappa P Sharma as ""Vanaram"", Harish Rai as ""Khasim"", Achyuth Kumar as ""Guru Pandian"" and Govinda Gowda as the cheeky ""office assistant"". Srinidhi Shetty is nondescript as Rocky Bhai's love interest ""Reena"", with their romance track bordering on an extreme case of Stockholm Syndrome, being the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless mass masala entertainer.Prashant Neel's ability to smoothly intercut the main timeline with flashbacks to Rocky Bhai's childhood means that the mother character, played ably by Archana Jois, makes an even more emotionally endearing impact on Chapter 2, with the mother-son bond continuing to be the glue that holds together what would otherwise have been a shallow massy outing.Prashant Neel has made creating innovative mass elevation sequences an art form and with a star of Yash's natural badassery and swagger as his foil, the auteur has clearly cut loose with the sheer scale and scope of his sets rising to earthshattering levels, without sacrificing on ingenuity and the ability to catch the audience by surprise. The intro sequences of our three primary characters, played by Yash, Dutt and Tandon are choreographed with pinpoint precision to evoke maximum mass impact and are custom-made to play to each performer's strengths. While Neel uses Dutt's eyes and hulky silhouette to portray his beastly and brutal nature, with Tandon, he resorts to using minimal hand and facial gestures to showcase the sheer unspoken power wielded by her character, inspired by India's Iron Lady, Indira Gandhi herself.And what can I say about Yash that hasn't been already said? Irrepressible swag, a natural coyness and obnoxious body language mean he is a natural fit as the morally ambiguous gangster and it is this very nature that adds to the unpredictability of the KGF universe with the audience constantly on the ropes, unable to guess or comprehend what the crazy mafioso will do next. Music director Ravi Basrur carries on the same rich vein as in the first part, elevating each punch sequence with layers of feeling and goosebumps, switching over effortlessly from the massy highs of ""Sulthana"" to the emotionally wrought ""Thannane"".""KGF Chapter 2"" stands head and shoulders over other recent Indian blockbuster fan service mass vehicles like ""Pushpa (2021)"" and ""RRR (2022)"" because of the editing and staging prowess of its director, with seemingly unrelenting action and a narrative that constantly keeps you guessing and on a knife-edge. A mandatory theatre watch! Highly, highly recommended! And don't forget to catch the post-credits scene!",perfect mass masala superstar vehicle,omg what did i just watch kgf chapter 2 is blistering adrenaline pumping high stakes sequel what was era defining part 1 that propelled not just prashant neel superstar yash but also entire kannada film industry into national prominence team has clearly made best use higher budget it received after first films success keeping emotional resonance original intact building elaborate well written intelligently shot edited mass elevation scenes that will keep you clamouring more till awe inspiring climax we rejoin our hero rocky bhai as he takes over control kolar gold fields after having killed demonic garuda first film only have entire can worms open up as consequence with everyone ranging garudas vengeful uncle adheera sanjay dutt prime minister india ravika raveena tandon training their sights his lucrative fiefdom director prashant neel gets his casting choices spot with both these bollywood biggies bringing their game as menacing antagonists that hold their own against yashs sheer swag star power void left by legendary kannada actor anand nat opting not return franchise due personal reasons was ably filled by national award winner prakash raj while rest returning cast play their roles with flourish especially ayyappa p sharma as vanaram harish rai as khasim achyuth kumar as guru pandian govinda gowda as cheeky office assistant srinidhi shetty is nondescript as rocky bhais love interest reena with their romance track bordering extreme case stockholm syndrome being only hiccup otherwise flawless mass masala entertainer prashant neels ability smoothly intercut main timeline with flashbacks rocky bhais childhood means that mother character played ably by archana jois makes even more emotionally endearing impact chapter 2 with mother son bond continuing be glue that holds together what would otherwise have been shallow massy outing prashant neel has made creating innovative mass elevation sequences art form with star yashs natural badassery swagger as his foil auteur has clearly cut loose with sheer scale scope his sets rising earthshattering levels without sacrificing ingenuity ability catch audience by surprise intro sequences our three primary characters played by yash dutt tandon are choreographed with pinpoint precision evoke maximum mass impact are custom made play each performers strengths while neel uses dutts eyes hulky silhouette portray his beastly brutal nature with tandon he resorts using minimal hand facial gestures showcase sheer unspoken power wielded by her character inspired by indias iron lady indira gandhi herself what can i say about yash that hasnt been already said irrepressible swag natural coyness obnoxious body language mean he is natural fit as morally ambiguous gangster it is this very nature that adds unpredictability kgf universe with audience constantly ropes unable guess or comprehend what crazy mafioso will do next music director ravi basrur carries same rich vein as first part elevating each punch sequence with layers feeling goosebumps switching over effortlessly massy highs sulthana emotionally wrought thannane kgf chapter 2 stands head shoulders over other recent indian blockbuster fan service mass vehicles like pushpa 2021 rrr 2022 because editing staging prowess its director with seemingly unrelenting action narrative that constantly keeps you guessing knife edge mandatory theatre watch highly highly recommended dont forget catch post credits scene,0.5515205505279034,0.14064573906485667,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.23, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.43}"
8,"In terms of Pure Charisma, there's nobody like Yash, he is something else!","The people who fell in love with the first chapter, I can safely say that they are in for an absolute delight. It's bigger, better and more grand in the truest sense of the word! Prashant Neel knew what the fans wished for and he duly delivers. With electrifying Cinematography, phenomenal background score and a surplus of action set pieces, it's nothing but an Action Junky's dream come true.Regardless, speaking of my personal opinion on it, I did enjoy my time in the theatres, and did take a strong liking to whatever this had in its offerings; However, I wasn't fully sold on it.Halt the hate train and just let me clarify...I have mainly two criticisms, one is about the forceful incorporation of romance (which was mostly counterproductive) and the other one is a somewhat loose portrayal of Sanjay Dutt as ""Adheera"". Just try to remember what Prashant Neel previously did with Ramachandra Raju as Garuda. That character, not only looked ferocious and frightening he also talked evil, acted evil, and the whole aura around him was appalling to say the very least.Now when it comes to Adheera, the impression is quite distinct. Don't get me wrong, he still is efficient enough and Mr Dutt played the role remarkably well, it's just that his character appeared more like a murderous, bloodthirsty warrior (inspired by Viking traditions) than a vicious, vile adversary against our lead protagonist.For Srinidhi Shetty (as Reena); My qualms are a little different. I would not put the entire blame on her, as she did whatever the director had made her do. It's her character, or the writing rather, that leaves much to be desired. On a side note, I admire what they did with Ramika Sen; she's fierce, desperate and very much to the point. Needless to say, Raveena Tandon did an incredible job as well.Looking at how my review had gone so far, you guys might be having some doubts regarding my judgements, well, don't get any wrong ideas cause I wholeheartedly appreciate the film for what it is and what it represents. And the main reason for my fondness goes to Yash aka Rocky!I'm telling you, this man is something else. I have seen lots of superstars over the years but none come remotely close to what Yash brings to the table. His magnetic personality, the specific way in which he delivers his lines, and the undeniable charisma that he possesses; it's truly one of a kind, unparalleled in every sense.",terms pure charisma theres nobody like yash he is something else,people who fell love with first chapter i can safely say that they are absolute delight its bigger better more grand truest sense word prashant neel knew what fans wished he duly delivers with electrifying cinematography phenomenal background score surplus action set pieces its nothing but action junkys dream come true regardless speaking my personal opinion it i did enjoy my time theatres did take strong liking whatever this had its offerings however i wasnt fully sold it halt hate train just let me clarify i have mainly two criticisms one is about forceful incorporation romance which was mostly counterproductive other one is somewhat loose portrayal sanjay dutt as adheera just try remember what prashant neel previously did with ramachandra raju as garuda that character not only looked ferocious frightening he also talked evil acted evil whole aura around him was appalling say very least now when it comes adheera impression is quite distinct dont get me wrong he still is efficient enough mr dutt played role remarkably well its just that his character appeared more like murderous bloodthirsty warrior inspired by viking traditions than vicious vile adversary against our lead protagonist srinidhi shetty as reena my qualms are little different i would not put entire blame her as she did whatever director had made her do its her character or writing rather that leaves much be desired side note i admire what they did with ramika sen shes fierce desperate very much point needless say raveena tandon did incredible job as well looking at how my review had gone so far you guys might be having some doubts regarding my judgements well dont get any wrong ideas cause i wholeheartedly appreciate film what it is what it represents main reason my fondness goes yash aka rocky im telling you this man is something else i have seen lots superstars over years but none come remotely close what yash brings table his magnetic personality specific way which he delivers his lines undeniable charisma that he possesses its truly one kind unparalleled every sense,0.5994846153846153,0.02789725274725277,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.39}"
