8,Another Sachy Brilliance,"Felt the storyline very similar to 'Driving License'. Still liked the movie. As a flaw to point out, the film is a bit lengthy around 3 hrs, could have made it short.

9,"Capsule Review: Ayyappanum Koshiyum / Gritty, Powerful Drama About the Male Ego / 9 Stars","It's pure, almost sadistic joy to watch the story unfold and slip into total chaos in Ayyappanum Koshiyum (Ayyappan and Koshy; given names in Malayalam) where a grim-looking police officer with a sinister past named Ayyappan (Biju Menon) locks horns with an influential, alcoholic ex-army businessman Koshy (Prithviraj) after the latter gets into trouble with the law for possessing liquor while travelling through a dry area. The drama begins without preamble and lets the effervescent male ego take the baton ahead as the two adults get into the rink to fight it off even as a tit-for-tat game emerges between them that sees collateral damage of the highest order. It is rather difficult to describe the ways in which these two characters behave but you are bound to get it from the first frame as the thirst for revenge quickly encapsulates them, one after other. Both Menon and Prithviraj put up a show that is hard to resist, backed with Sachy's linear storytelling and thumping music by Jakes Bejoy that does not ever get dull despite the 3-hour running time tag. And when a drama - that although tends to become repetitive in the middle - manages to keep you glued to the screen for such a long time with some terrific sequences of violence, it should be praised and watched on the big screen. But even then, Ayyappanum Koshiyum is not just about the male ego, but also aspires to describe the workings of it which is where Ranjith's father character comes and takes you by the collar. Also notable is the character played by Gauri Nanda and the fluid performances of Sabumon and Anil Nedumangad. Watch it because it is a rare feat for Malayalam cinema.

8,Prithviraj is on a roll.,Another impressive offering featuring Prithviraj after the much enjoyable Driving License. Truth be told I remember watching the early parts of the movie and thinking that this is a role tailor-made for Prithviraj. He is almost brilliant in the first half as the prick. I thought the first half of the movie was cinema gold. The second half is not as great as the first half but it is still pretty good. I think they were struggling to write a proper climax for the movie and thus it stretches for close to 3 hours. Its not a bad ending but its not as good as the ending of Maheshinthe Prathikaram.I was really impressed with the actor who plays Prithviraj's father. I was honestly wondering why he doesnt get many more roles. Turns out he is the producer. Its not the greatest acting ever but I reckon he is as good as anyone in the Malayalam film industry who could have played that role. Biju Menon is brilliant as usual.Even at 3 hours long at no stage does the movie lag. Fantastic movie.

7,A good entertainer.,"AK is a duel between rich and poor. We the audience will support both. That's where the script wins. It keeps us on the edge of our seats to see who wins this duel. Eventhough the around 3 hour length wears a little, we don't get bored because of the excellent performance of the duel stars and very good script writing. Prithviraj and Biju Menon were l fighting in real life to be the best actor in the movie and both of them wins. The dialogues are also very good. The music was also good to bring that wilderness feel in Attapadi. The movie is similar to Driving License which also starred Prithviraj but AK is a better version of DL. Ranjith also did a very good job in a supporting role and his character was also developed in a good manner as with the two leads. The action choreography was top notch and one of the best in Mollywood in recent times.

9,Retired soldier vs Ex Assassin,"Like driving license, ayyappanum koshiyum is a rivalry between an influential and common man. But it's not an ego clash but a revenge drama. The speciality of sachi's scripts is neatness. But in ayyapanum koshiyum he makes it rustic too. The show stealer is biju menon who is finally freed from that vellimoonga zone. He's impeccable as ayyapppan nair since he has the physique of a beast. Biju menon's character is elevated only because prithviraj underplayed his character. Despite being lengthy, one wont feel bored. Cinematography, music is top class.

8,Ayyappanum Koshiyum - A gripping entertainer,"It is really remarkable to realize that 2 different Malayalam films released in less than 2 months under the same story writer with almost a similar thread come up with an above par narrative nullifying any similarity in the treatment. This reinstates the fact the films are not only about stories but also how it is told, the making, and there lies the magic.Ayyappanum Koshiyum, in a nutshell, is a gripping tale of 2 male egos fighting their guts out to prove their supremacy, strength, influences. The 2 male characters Ayyappan & Koshi coming from the different socio-economic backgrounds are drawn to a scenario where they have to deal with the ego conflicts and it reaches a point where it becomes difficult for them to tame their egos.From a plot perspective, when we look at a very high level, it is a saga of revenge drama episode after episode, and there is no major revelation in the storyline. The makers compensate this aspect with interesting scenes, extracting some real good performances from the lead characters, the use of music, the location backdrop making the overall film-viewing experience satisfactory, it hooked me till the running time.The film with its almost 3-hour running time is a complete entertainer where it attempts to pamper the chauvinist ideologies still relevant in any society, and at the same time mocking these ideologies and that's where the film stands out completely for me. The film also brings out the social disparity that exists in our ecosystem and it does not stop there, the makers etch out a strong female character (Ayyappan's wife) who has this revolting mindset trying to be the change for equal rights.The performances from the lead characters were top-grade, especially Prithviraj, probably due to the layered characterization of Koshi bringing out strength, vulnerability, compassion, anger. The ensemble cast was good, not great, they provide apt support to the overall film to sail through the running time.Ayyappanum Koshiyum - Highly recommended, available on Amazon Prime",ayyappanum koshiyum gripping entertainer,it is really remarkable realize that 2 different malayalam films released less than 2 months under same story writer with almost similar thread come up with above par narrative nullifying any similarity treatment this reinstates fact films are not only about stories but also how it is told making there lies magic ayyappanum koshiyum nutshell is gripping tale 2 male egos fighting their guts out prove their supremacy strength influences 2 male characters ayyappan koshi coming different socio economic backgrounds are drawn scenario where they have deal with ego conflicts it reaches point where it becomes difficult them tame their egos plot perspective when we look at very high level it is saga revenge drama episode after episode there is no major revelation storyline makers compensate this aspect with interesting scenes extracting some real good performances lead characters use music location backdrop making overall film viewing experience satisfactory it hooked me till running time film with its almost 3 hour running time is complete entertainer where it attempts pamper chauvinist ideologies still relevant any society at same time mocking these ideologies thats where film stands out completely me film also brings out social disparity that exists our ecosystem it does not stop there makers etch out strong female character ayyappans wife who has this revolting mindset trying be change equal rights performances lead characters were top grade especially prithviraj probably due layered characterization koshi bringing out strength vulnerability compassion anger ensemble cast was good not great they provide apt support overall film sail through running time ayyappanum koshiyum highly recommended available amazon prime,0.4940256410256409,0.13961752136752134,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.17, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.34}"

The clash is between the high society individual with high level connections and police officer with an unblemished service record, where the former is ego hurt and the later is fighting for his credentials and his family. The fight is against the social evils of influences for personal gains, against the criminals looking for loopholes, to escape from the hands of law and against the rugged mind which could be controlled by discipline.Kannamma, Ayyappan Nair's wife is a trial activist and her dialogues are strong for her personality. Kurien, Koshy's father is a typical high range landlord. Every character of this presentation has their importance and well placed to unfold the story. Background music and songs play to keep the audience more tensed. Camera work keep the details well, for our entertainment. Action sequences are choreographed well.

7,Indian Cinema can never create that superlative ethical face off like Batman vs Joker from The Dark Knight but let's just be happy that we have a Superb attempt like this.,"Ayyappanum Koshiyum (2020) : Brief Review -Indian Cinema can never create that superlative ethical face off like Batman vs Joker from The Dark Knight but let's just be happy that we have a Superb attempt like this. AK - Ayyappanum Koshiyum is Malayalam Cinema's attempt to explore the clash between titans with less violence. Remember that Joker vs Batman face Off in The Dark Knight? Joker don't want to kill Batman because he wants a comfortable enemy and Batman can't kill Joker because of his ethics. So here, we just have to exclude that No-killing policy and rest we are all set for a Ethical and Respectable face off. The story revolves around the clash between Ayyappan, a senior police officer who serves at the Attappadi Police Station and Havildar Koshi, who comes to the village with a motive to humiliate or rather say ruin Ayyappan. This face off is extremely intense from the start to the end. Every single frame shows the high-quality vision of Director Sachy. How amazingly has he crafted this story. I mean, the story isn't anything out of the world or that, it becomes quite predictable after a while but Sachy has kept the atmospheric tension intact for 170 minutes. That's too long you know and that's why it is commendable. Sachy's vision deserves to be noted by filmmakers more than audience. The way he moves camera, those frames and that chilling background score everything is so excruciating. Prithviraj Sukumaran, what a performer he is. When it comes to intense roles, he just can't stop making it better. I was expecting him to do well but Biju Menon came as a surprise to me. What a fantastic act he has delivered and that too when his character wasn't a young one, yet he brought that machoism.

9,A Performance packed egoistic taming competition,"The outright taming competition between Prithviraj Sukumaran and Biju Menon, resulted in one of the best dramas I witnessed in recent times. Portraying egoistic adults is not an easy job. If one slightly misses his tone, it will have a drastic effect on the overall tone of the film. In this case, Prithviraj and Biju complemented each other, giving out the much needed breathing space for themselves and audience alike. The effective use of forest area and the background music, brought out the rawness of the nature. The film shows that each and every person should be tamed to a particular yield point (as in engineering), from which they can bounce back, when in need. Looking forward for its Thamizh adaptation! Hope its not a remake..",performance packed egoistic taming competition,outright taming competition between prithviraj sukumaran biju menon resulted one best dramas i witnessed recent times portraying egoistic adults is not easy job if one slightly misses his tone it will have drastic effect overall tone film this case prithviraj biju complemented each other giving out much needed breathing space themselves audience alike effective use forest area background music brought out rawness nature film shows that each every person should be tamed particular yield point as engineering which they can bounce back when need looking forward its thamizh adaptation hope its not remake,0.4381944444444444,-0.011805555555555567,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.0, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.47}"

10,An extremely engaging duel of 2 men who are as different as chalk & cheese !,"Synopsis: ""Ayyappanum Koshiyum"" revolves around the protracted duel between Ayyappan Nair (Biju Menon playing the role of a Senior Sub-Inspector of Police who comes from an unprivileged background), and Koshy Kurien (Prithviraj as a retired Army Havildar who belongs to a wealthy & influential family). The seeds of the conflict between these 2 characters are sown within the first few minutes of the movie, and the story goes on to detail the methods these men use to destroy each other, even without caring for the larger consequences of their actions.Review: This is Sachy's second Directorial venture in Malayalam after 2015's Superhit ""Anarkali"" that had the same duo of Prithviraj & Biju Menon in the lead. While they were cast as close friends in that film, this film pits them as enemies. And in my personal opinion, for both Prithviraj & Biju Menon the characters of Koshy & Ayyappan are among the most uncharacteristic roles they have ever played, and to their credit they have succeeded at breathing life & blood into both these characters. As the egoistic bigmouth who masks his insecurities and humanity most of the time - Prithviraj is fabulous as Ex-Havildar Koshy. The actions of his character are quite unlikable, but even so Prithviraj manages to make the viewer empathize with him. In contrast, Biju Menon plays Sub-Inspector Ayyappan Nair with superb restraint; though the character appears sober and civilized on the surface, we can also see that he is hiding a raging storm within that can demolish anyone when its lets loose. Its really good to see Biju Menon play such a meaty character that highlights his underrated acting prowess (instead of the usual comic roles he usually does), and let's hope that he gets to play more of such weighty roles. Everyone in the supporting cast has performed their roles to perfection, though the standout is veteran Director Ranjith playing the role of Kurien John (Koshi's father) - an arrogant man of wealth & privilege, with a conceited sense of Male Ego. Also notable are Gowri Nandha as Ayyappan's wife and Anil Nedumangad as Circle Inspector Sathish. The screenplay deserves credit for efficiently spacing out the various conflicts even while allowing us to get a good look into the mindset of the different characters. The story and events are narrated quite realistically, and even though a couple of sequences are not entirely convincing, that does not effect the flow or substance of the film. The Cinematography & Background score ably complement the various hues & tones of the film. As both the Writer & Director of this movie, Sachy has done a commendable job in extracting fine performances from the entire cast, and he has also succeeded in depicting this story of conflict in an extremely engaging manner.Conclusion: In these times when most people have short attention spans and low patience, Directors naturally find it difficult to keep the audience involved in any movie that is over 2 hours long. However, Writer-Director Sachy has managed to go against the trend and made an extremely engaging movie with a runtime of nearly 3 hours (177 minutes). He deserves all the applause for this cinematic achievement.
