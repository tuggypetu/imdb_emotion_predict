10,Kamal version of Kaithi...Highly recommended,"RATED 10/10 Language: Tamil Media Partner: Hotstar Source: NIL RECOMMENDEDKamal's most action packed film delivered without any lag from beginning to end. Even though we have bunch of stars in the cast, Vikram shines out everyone, at the same time everyone's space is kept well... Movie has lot of Easter eggs from the beginning to end. Lot of reference to Lokesh and Kamal movie references.The movie is surprise sequel to ""kaithi"".Lokesh compromised little bit in master, here its full and full Lokesh show with mass moments. First half Kamal is there in very few scenes only, but shown as much as possible shades of him. The first half belongs to Fahad and VS. The interval block with Vikram BGM ending is ultimate. The first half is kind of perfect version of ""valimai"".Second half is filed with action sequences. The Milk fight scene and climax Kaithi fights are top notch. Movie has more gore and violent graphics...Lokesh handled the second half brilliantly and balanced with all cast perfectly. Very big Kudos to Lokesh...

9,"Once upon a time, there lived a ghost!","Call it a magnum opus, or larger than life, but Vikram has been worth the wait. A Kamal Haasan film always brings innovation with it, and Vikram aces it in action. Mounted on superlative production values and a breathtaking pace, Vikram doesn't have one dull moment in its 146 minutes of running timeThe film starts with a series of murders, including that of Karan (Kamal Haasan) perpetrated by a team of vigilantes that claims to be cleaning up the system by waging a war against the system. Two of the three people murdered were policemen who had captured a large consignment of drugs and hidden the same in an unknown place, and Karan was the foster father of one of them. This is just the beginning. The Chennai Police Commissioner calls upon a crack team of sleuths led by Amar (Fahadh Faasil) to trace down the culprits as they are the best in the business. Amar and team go about systematically and conclude the case with a warning to the Commissioner himself - that Amar knew who murdered one of the two policemen, and that Vikram, the original leader of the Black Squad from the 1980s, taken for dead, is back to life and out on a mission to rid the nation of the drug menace.Vikram (Kamal Haasan) is in reality an undercover agent leading a team of vigilantes, cleaning up drug mercenaries knowing very well that their current crop of antagonists headed by a local drug lord Chandhan (Vijay Sethupati) are just small fish that must be dealt with. The real big fish Rolex is who their ultimate aim is.Vikram, helmed by Lokesh Kanagaraj is visually spectacular. A taut action adventure, it extracts Kamal Haasan to his fullest potential, but doesn't showcase him in every frame to make sufficient space for Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupati too. In fact, the three men are the core of Vikram, in very different roles that make the movie immensely watchable with a mix of myriad emotions and action at its best. The climax is violent, with the use of an arsenal of firearms and hand to hand combat, setting up a finger licking wait for the potential sequel where Vikram will lock horns with Rolex (Suriya, playing a surprise cameo). Don't wait for Vikram to drop into OTT platforms, for a film like this must only be watched in the theatres.",once upon time there lived ghost,call it magnum opus or larger than life but vikram has been worth wait kamal haasan film always brings innovation with it vikram aces it action mounted superlative production values breathtaking pace vikram doesnt have one dull moment its 146 minutes running timethe film starts with series murders including that karan kamal haasan perpetrated by team vigilantes that claims be cleaning up system by waging war against system two three people murdered were policemen who had captured large consignment drugs hidden same unknown place karan was foster father one them this is just beginning chennai police commissioner calls upon crack team sleuths led by amar fahadh faasil trace down culprits as they are best business amar team go about systematically conclude case with warning commissioner himself that amar knew who murdered one two policemen that vikram original leader black squad 1980s taken dead is back life out mission rid nation drug menace vikram kamal haasan is reality undercover agent leading team vigilantes cleaning up drug mercenaries knowing very well that their current crop antagonists headed by local drug lord chandhan vijay sethupati are just small fish that must be dealt with real big fish rolex is who their ultimate aim is vikram helmed by lokesh kanagaraj is visually spectacular taut action adventure it extracts kamal haasan his fullest potential but doesnt showcase him every frame make sufficient space fahadh faasil vijay sethupati too fact three men are core vikram very different roles that make movie immensely watchable with mix myriad emotions action at its best climax is violent with use arsenal firearms hand hand combat setting up finger licking wait potential sequel where vikram will lock horns with rolex suriya playing surprise cameo dont wait vikram drop into ott platforms film like this must only be watched theatres,0.4931976446492576,0.09221710189452123,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.03, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.46}"

9,A fanboy film that celebrates Kamal Hassan to the fullest extent!,"The buildup and marketing to Lokesh Kanagaraj's Kamal Hassan starrer ""Vikram"" has been nothing short of all-encompassing, driven primarily by the fact that the 36-year old young director is yet to direct a sub-par movie, with ""Maanagaram (2017)"", ""Kaithi (2019)"" and ""Master (2021)"", all having been well-received by audiences. And the precocious storyteller delivers, with a mazy yet continuously engaging crime saga with resounding mass elevation sequences and enough emotional hooks to keep the audience invested.3-time National Award winner for Best Actor Kamal Hassan stars as a grieving father heartbroken at the loss of his son, who was a policeman investigating the burgeoning drug mafia in Chennai and who had, before his mysterious murder, uncovered a staggering cache of illegal drugs the syndicate safeguarded . Enter Fahadh Faasil, a black ops specialist charged with unraveling the mystery around the carnage unleashed by the cartel as a result. Vijay Sethupathi stars as the head honcho of the vicious and vengeful mafia operation and is first shown to the audience in one of the most intricately weaved, deliciously bonkers intro sequences for an antagonist in recent memory.It is testament to Lokesh Kanagaraj's directorial genius that he manages to give his three lead actors enough room to develop their characters and build a connect with the viewers. If it is Sethupathi's quirky eccentricities that catch the eye, Fahadh's intensity weaves a subplot of its own while Kamal excels in the emotional sequences. Lokesh Kanagaraj had told us to rewatch his classic ""Kaithi (2019)"" before we went to theaters to watch ""Vikram"" and with good reason, with the two movies being intricately connected and seemingly leading up to an extensive LKU-A mouth-watering Lokesh Kanagaraj Universe! A fantastic cameo from superstar Suriya is the cherry on the cake, with the actor looking the most stylish and massy he has in years!The director's penchant for crime thrillers, retro music and biryani continues to hold good for ""Vikram"" with Anirudh Ravichander's music rendering a soaring sheen to the narrative being built. The callbacks and references to old Kamal classics blend smoothly with the storytelling and are never jarring or contrived. The actor's phenomenal voice modulation and expressive eyes elevate even simple sequences to another level, especially his interactions with his toddler grandson.Master stunt choreographer duo Anbariv continue the same rich vein of form they displayed in the KGF franchise, but this time sacrificing the larger canvas for more close-quarters, hand-to-hand combat in tight spaces. Girish Gangadharan's cinematographer is other-worldly as usual, soaking up the bone-crunching action in all its glory. Editor Philomin Raj also deserves praise for ensuring that a movie with a seemingly daunting 3 hour run-time is never boring at any stretch.While you might see many of the plot's twists coming, the visual grammar, treatment and picturization takes your breath away, nevertheless. ""Vikram"" is yet another endeavor from a superstar fanboy that pays rich dividends, along the lines of Prithviraj's Mohanlal tribute ""Lucifer (2019)"", Karthik Subbaraj's Rajnikanth-starrer ""Pettah (2019)"" as well as Amal Neerad's ode to Mammootty, ""Bheeshma Parvam (2022)"".

7,"Loud, obnoxious and fun... At least for the most part","As much as I enjoyed this movie, I still feel like this shouldn't have been a Kamal Haasan movie.Kamal has had a string of great movies recently... With Unnaipol Oruvan; a dialogue-heavy movie where the conflict required no excessiveness, with Vishwaroopam; a movie while flawed, was ambitious enough to take Tamil cinema to a non-Tamil accustomed front, with Uttama Villain; one of Kamal Haasan's best movies to date that is one of the very few movies in this exaggerated industry to consciously portray cinema as an actual art form, with Papanasam; one of the most simplest, yet a brilliantly made thrillers, with Thoongavanam; a movie that seemed to rid itself of every cliche that plagues the Tamil cinema industry (this includes the runtime as well), and Vishwaroopam 2; well.... Vishwaroopam 2 never happened.And after 4 years, we have a new Kamal Haasan movie; which while enjoyable by Tamil cinema standards, doesn't have the ambitions and the cinematic progressiveness that Kamal movies have had. It was very well written, especially in its first half, but ultimately ends up being a Tamil action movie and I need not asterisk anything. The energy of the movie never waned and while it did seem like the writers hyped the story into a cliche third act, the movie holds up well, very well in fact, in the entertainment box.Overall, I'd rather have seen this movie with some other actor since I feel like this macho persona is best left for someone that is not Kamal Haasan... not that he's bad at it, he actually did a stellar job, but because as of right now, he's the only big name Tamil actor to push the boundaries of this cursed industry. The last thing I'd want from him is the usual Tamil archetype overpowered Super Saiyan freak that we've seen a million times.",loud obnoxious fun at least most part,as much as i enjoyed this movie i still feel like this shouldnt have been kamal haasan movie kamal has had string great movies recently with unnaipol oruvan dialogue heavy movie where conflict required no excessiveness with vishwaroopam movie while flawed was ambitious enough take tamil cinema non tamil accustomed front with uttama villain one kamal haasans best movies date that is one very few movies this exaggerated industry consciously portray cinema as actual art form with papanasam one most simplest yet brilliantly made thrillers with thoongavanam movie that seemed rid itself every cliche that plagues tamil cinema industry this includes runtime as well vishwaroopam 2 well vishwaroopam 2 never happened after 4 years we have new kamal haasan movie which while enjoyable by tamil cinema standards doesnt have ambitions cinematic progressiveness that kamal movies have had it was very well written especially its first half but ultimately ends up being tamil action movie i need not asterisk anything energy movie never waned while it did seem like writers hyped story into cliche third act movie holds up well very well fact entertainment box overall id rather have seen this movie with some other actor since i feel like this macho persona is best left someone that is not kamal haasan not that hes bad at it he actually did stellar job but because as right now hes only big name tamil actor push boundaries this cursed industry last thing id want him is usual tamil archetype overpowered super saiyan freak that weve seen million times,0.43202999381570817,0.12389868068439494,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.29}"
9,Good movie with Great Performances,"Vikram is one of the most interesting and anticipating movie for everyone because of the massive star cast. After Pushpa, RRR and KGF Chapter 2, Vikram is released to roar. The film is a complete commercial paisa wasool movie.First half of the movie is fantastic. Fahadh Faasil is the best young actor in today's time according to me. He has done a superb job. Vijay Setupathy is a gem of an actor. I loved his entry scene here. No other actor can pull up this entry scene as he has done it. Other star cast is also very much suitable and provide a good support. First half belongs to FaFa and Vijay.While, the second half is a treat for Kamal Haasan fans. Ulaga Nayagan- Kamal Haasan is extremely good in the post interval portion. You will be surprised to see him firing constantly from the giant machine gun. That scene is on another level.Though, one may find first half awesome and second half a bit stretched. I found that there are some surprises in the later half, but there are a few blunders too. But just a few. Like I didn't get the scene of child re-breathing.Special mention to the actress who played the role of a maid. She is superb.Lokesh's direction is improving gradually. This film will be considered his finest directorial product. He has done a fine job, without getting caught by the idea of too much slow-motion, which many people hate including me, and which were too much in KGF. Though, this film is different from RRR and KGF, it can be compared with Pushpa. As part 2 is coming here too. People are going to love Surya as the bad guy in part two.
