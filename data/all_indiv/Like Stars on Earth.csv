10.0,Best Depiction of Dyslexia Ever in a Fictional Film,"As I just became aware of this film a few weeks ago, and ordered a DVD and watched it today (10-9-11) this review is unlikely to be seen by many because the film is 4 years old and there are nearly 250 user reviews already. So rather than rehash the plot, I will first mention that I have been an Educational Therapist for over 45 years, and have worked extensively with dyslexic and ADD and ADHD children in my practice, so this film had intrinsic interest to me going in. But despite seeing many films on learning problems through the years, some very good, I have never seen any movie that can come close to this one both in emotional power and subject accuracy. When I saw that the film is 165 minutes long, I was expecting to watch it in two sittings, but I never once felt the need to take a break, and in the second half of the film, when the director Aamir Khan enters the story, I was riveted continuously, and embarrassingly shed more than a few tears. If you have any interest in education and the problems the outsiders face, this is a must-see. And if you just want to see an intelligent drama with no car chases, explosions, sex scenes, or ultra violence, then you will be glad you saw this wonderful film, which, by the way, while it is about children, is not really for children, unless they are over about 11 or 12, or have suffered the experience of failing due to undiagnosed or treated reading or similar learning difference. Don't let the Disney Studio name fool you, this does not feel like a typical Disney movie, but the film does point out that Walt Disney himself had school learning problems as a child. Another aspect of the film is something I always try to impart to my clients: There is life after school. And it is not necessary to be the best at everything to be successful. Just become the best you are able and try to find something you like doing that makes you happy.The rest will take care of itself. What a great film!Since I first wrote this review, I have rewatched it 5 more times, and now consider it the best film I have ever seen, and that encompasses about 2500 films.",best depiction dyslexia ever fictional film,as i just became aware this film few weeks ago ordered dvd watched it today 10 9 11 this review is unlikely be seen by many because film is 4 years old there are nearly 250 user reviews already so rather than rehash plot i will first mention that i have been educational therapist over 45 years have worked extensively with dyslexic add adhd children my practice so this film had intrinsic interest me going but despite seeing many films learning problems through years some very good i have never seen any movie that can come close this one both emotional power subject accuracy when i saw that film is 165 minutes long i was expecting watch it two sittings but i never once felt need take break second half film when director aamir khan enters story i was riveted continuously embarrassingly shed more than few tears if you have any interest education problems outsiders face this is must see if you just want see intelligent drama with no car chases explosions sex scenes or ultra violence then you will be glad you saw this wonderful film which by way while it is about children is not really children unless they are over about 11 or 12 or have suffered experience failing due undiagnosed or treated reading or similar learning difference dont let disney studio name fool you this does not feel like typical disney movie but film does point out that walt disney himself had school learning problems as child another aspect film is something i always try impart my clients there is life after school it is not necessary be best at everything be successful just become best you are able try find something you like doing that makes you happy rest will take care itself what great film since i first wrote this review i have rewatched it 5 more times now consider it best film i have ever seen that encompasses about 2500 films,0.45473684210526316,0.3035526315789474,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.22}"
10.0,"'My child always comes first in class', this syndrome has truly ruined everything.","The film brings to light what it is truly like to be dyslexic. Aamir Khan succeeded in creating the awareness about dyslexia thru this film. Sometimes we really need to step into the shoes of kids and see the world thru their point of view. The irony is that we all were kids, we all went thru the pressure of performing in sports n studies but yet we push our kids, especially in India n China.The child actor is amazing, Aamir stole the show, the music is great, the pacing is very good n the film's script is one of the best to come out from Bollywood.",my child always comes first class this syndrome has truly ruined everything,film brings light what it is truly like be dyslexic aamir khan succeeded creating awareness about dyslexia thru this film sometimes we really need step into shoes kids see world thru their point view irony is that we all were kids we all went thru pressure performing sports n studies but yet we push our kids especially india n china child actor is amazing aamir stole show music is great pacing is very good n films script is one best come out bollywood,0.6204166666666666,0.52,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.17}"
10.0,Among the best films I've ever seen...and the best Indian one...and that's saying A LOT!,"I love Indian films and have seen more than most Americans. However, considering the country makes more films than any other (about 800 a year), I really have only seen a small number of their films. But, I must say that ""Tarre Zameen Par"" (""Like Stars on Earth"") is the best Indian film I've seen...even slightly better than ""Kahaahi"" and ""Three Idiots"" (another Aamir Khan film). It truly is a wonderful film and is better than nearly anything coming out of Hollywood these days.The story is a sad but ultimately happy one. Eight year-old Ishaan is a problem child. Nearly everyone around him sees him as a trouble maker and kid with a horrible attitude. But no one bothers looking at these behaviors as signs of a deeper problem...the boy is illiterate and also cannot do math because he has very severe Dyslexia. At first, you see him acting out. Later, when he's been punished for this by sending him off to a boarding school, his spirit is crushed. He's sullen, and most importantly, severely depressed and almost non-communicative. And then...he has a new art teacher who has worked with disabled kids before...and he recognizes the kid's problems...as well as the kid's potential! Considering it's a nearly three hour film, there of course is much more to it...and the film is a joy to watch.Brilliant writing, brilliant acting and a very brave and lovely production overall make this an amazing and perfect film. I have no complaints about ANYTHING in the film...nothing. It's perfect.",among best films ive ever seen best indian one thats saying lot,i love indian films have seen more than most americans however considering country makes more films than any other about 800 year i really have only seen small number their films but i must say that tarre zameen par like stars earth is best indian film ive seen even slightly better than kahaahi three idiots another aamir khan film it truly is wonderful film is better than nearly anything coming out hollywood these days story is sad but ultimately happy one eight year old ishaan is problem child nearly everyone around him sees him as trouble maker kid with horrible attitude but no one bothers looking at these behaviors as signs deeper problem boy is illiterate also cannot do math because he has very severe dyslexia at first you see him acting out later when hes been punished this by sending him off boarding school his spirit is crushed hes sullen most importantly severely depressed almost non communicative then he has new art teacher who has worked with disabled kids before he recognizes kids problems as well as kids potential considering its nearly three hour film there course is much more it film is joy watch brilliant writing brilliant acting very brave lovely production overall make this amazing perfect film i have no complaints about anything film nothing its perfect,0.5389290633608815,0.3161673553719008,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.2, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.2}"
8.0,Every Child is Special,"I'm not always a fan of the Bollywood style of filmmaking: overrun with musical montages and exaggerated dialogue and acting. But 'Like Stars on Earth' is a magical film about the magnificent abilities that children have, even when all the odds are against them. With a story as powerful as this one, it doesn't matter where or how the story is told.Luckily, most of the Bollywood clichés actually enhance the film experience. Being such an integral part of the story, the soundtrack and score complement the film wonderfully. Each song aligning nicely with the film's dramatic but hopeful tone. Admittedly, having a rap song play over Ishaan's family getting dressed and ready for the day is a bit jarring, but the songs that play after Aamir Khan appear are nothing short of enchanting.This film is about a dyslexic child who has basically given up on school as no one seems to think he's worth anything. His father beats him for goofing off and all of his teachers scold him for not being able to do the simplest of tasks. So, Ishaan finds his way to a boarding school where he meets Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) who may change his life forever. Everybody had that teacher who changed the way you approached school and perhaps even life itself, which is why I thought this movie was so effective. There's nothing more gratifying than watching someone struggling to find their way, only to have one uniquely suited person put them back on track. It seems so simple but coming from a teaching background, I'll be the first person to say that it can be nearly impossible to connect with someone who doesn't want any help. However, when and if that connection is made, it's possibly the most fulfilling thing a person can do. Aamir Khan captures these emotions perfectly near the end of Like Stars on Earth. I don't think I'll ever get the image of Ishaan's father breaking down into tears out of my head. There's some really powerful stuff here.8.6/10",every child is special,im not always fan bollywood style filmmaking overrun with musical montages exaggerated dialogue acting but like stars earth is magical film about magnificent abilities that children have even when all odds are against them with story as powerful as this one it doesnt matter where or how story is told luckily most bollywood clich s actually enhance film experience being such integral part story soundtrack score complement film wonderfully each song aligning nicely with films dramatic but hopeful tone admittedly having rap song play over ishaans family getting dressed ready day is bit jarring but songs that play after aamir khan appear are nothing short enchanting this film is about dyslexic child who has basically given up school as no one seems think hes worth anything his father beats him goofing off all his teachers scold him not being able do simplest tasks so ishaan finds his way boarding school where he meets ram shankar nikumbh aamir khan who may change his life forever everybody had that teacher who changed way you approached school perhaps even life itself which is why i thought this movie was so effective theres nothing more gratifying than watching someone struggling find their way only have one uniquely suited person put them back track it seems so simple but coming teaching background ill be first person say that it can be nearly impossible connect with someone who doesnt want any help however when if that connection is made its possibly most fulfilling thing person can do aamir khan captures these emotions perfectly near end like stars earth i dont think ill ever get image ishaans father breaking down into tears out my head theres some really powerful stuff here 8 6 10,0.6121223758320533,0.165373783922171,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.39, 'Sad': 0.19, 'Fear': 0.22}"
8.0,Some intelligent film-making there,"How many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you've seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you've been through in your life? As I saw Ishan (Darsheel Safary) today, I felt, somewhere deep within that that's me.Notwithstanding the slight retard nature, dyslexia and bad academic performance, the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish  just like he did. I painted, I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly, I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to ""move"" me, but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact, the scene where Ram (Aamir Khan) walks into Ishan's room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings, it made me feel like somebody had in fact, opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (Believe me, I still have them.) This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That's for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don't know and I don't care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don't watch this film if you're looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don't even skip this film thinking it's children's movie  no it isn't. In fact, Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies, then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people's lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.Okay, enough of fantasies. Technically, writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde, Leonardo da Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) Musically, it's two-thumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They're there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show. Tisca Chopra grabs attention.Aamir Khan, however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. That's the surprise but you don't miss Aamir in the first half because Darsheel will definitely grab your attention and Aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.All in all, I'd say go and watch the film. I wouldn't recommend if you're addicted to Yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent film-making, then Taare Zameen Par is a treat.",some intelligent film making there,how many times has there been movie you could really relate how many times has it happened that youve seen character screen that reminds something that youve been through your life as i saw ishan darsheel safary today i felt somewhere deep within that thats me notwithstanding slight retard nature dyslexia bad academic performance character ishan really made me remember my childhood today i remember i was something like him as child creative imaginative my imagination always went unappreciated i used curate gibberish just like he did i painted i dreamed i fantasized about different things so i feel writer amol gupte director aamir khan what wonderful debut have picked incredibly moving story frankly i am not easily moved by movies not even greatest tearjerkers have managed move me but moment i was stunned is this really happening me am i trying cry fact scene where ram aamir khan walks into ishans room discovers score sketches drawings it made me feel like somebody had fact opened my closet discovered my secret childhood fantasies believe me i still have them this movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents their lives thats sure i am moved i love this film i dont know i dont care how this film does box office but let me tell you dont watch this film if youre looking regular boy meets girl story dont even skip this film thinking its childrens movie no it isnt fact taare zameen par is movie potentially targeted towards parents but if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts lived life where people around you refuse appreciate your fantasies then definitely go it tzp mirrors many those peoples lives that looks just plain simple but those who compromised their dreams sake earthly existence okay enough fantasies technically writer amol gupte delivers grade script aamir khan shows his talent not just as actor but very versatile intelligent oscar wilde leonardo da vinci sally gardner were hardly ever heard hindi cinema before this writer just does not deliver well written script but also his knowledge research which other filmmakers hardly ever do musically its two thumbs up shanker ehsaan loy title song is fascinating maa jame raho combine talents all respects music words voice production design is superb not moment you feel anything is fake they even managed squeeze some quick visual effects animated scenes theyre there add another dimension great story telling casting is good well justified little darsheel steals show tisca chopra grabs attention aamir khan however stuns audience by appearing at almost near half film thats surprise but you dont miss aamir first half because darsheel will definitely grab your attention aamir gets show some good directorial talent all all id say go watch film i wouldnt recommend if youre addicted yashraj stuffs but if you really want see some intelligent film making then taare zameen par is treat,0.5466781269412849,0.19572890559732664,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.31}"
9.0,"Aamir scores an Ace, TZP a natural delight.","The ghost (director) has been resurrected in human flesh and yes, Mr Perfectionist has got it all perfect. His maiden directorial venture is a delight for one and all. Whether you are a kid, or a teenager, just married, or if you are a parent -- Yes... You'll love it! Pre-release in what appeared to be a non mainstream film, shines like a UNIVERSAL film which will keep the box office abuzz.The story moves along at a very natural pace at which the viewer is able to connect to the 8 year old dyslexic boy played by Darsheel Safary. That is the biggest plus point of the movie, the viewer draws parallel with the boys character connecting with him at a very high emotional level. You'll reminisce and be transported back to those wonderful years of your childhood and will have more than a tear in the eye. The scene where the boy is admitted in the boarding school and bidding goodbye to his parents and brother followed by the 'Maa' song is a real tear jerker. But tears is not all what you are going to have, the screenplay makes sure that those tear jerking moments are followed by heavy doses of laughter with some lovely and innocent humorous moments.If you thought that only Sanjay Leela Bhansali knew how to capture art on celluloid then watch TZP. The boy's bunked day at school, his room, classroom decor, and the painting competition in the end are a colorful visual delight expressing a million words to the viewers.Yes, its true. Aamir's character appears just before the end of the first half, but one is so engrossed that Aamir - The actor's absence is not felt. Thats remarkable! All the credit goes to the protagonist played by Darsheel who in my books gives the best performance till date by a child artist in Hindi Cinema. He is the heart and soul of the movie and how naturally this boy handles scenes of intense emotions with such ease in his first movie is stunning. Tisca Chopra as the boy's mother gives a top notch performance at par, if not above the likes of roles played by Nirupa Roy, Rakhi and Kirron Kher.Aamir the actor has a shorter but powerful role which he performs decently. But at the end of the day its Aamir - The Director who wins hands down by extracting 'A GRADE' performances from all the cast, and making a movie which connects to the heart of the viewer. The second half becomes a little slow in between and it could have been more crisp. But thats negligible because in the end the movie manages convincingly to convey a very important message to today's parents - Your kids are not race horses of a derby. Let them travel life at their pace as each has their unique mission which only they can fulfill.Lastly, TZP just made 2007 better and interesting.

And when in this moment of dearth one gets treated to a movie that simply touches the soul - needless to say - Taare Zameen Par - does just that.Aamir Khan proves his mettle as a director.

The younger one is always struggling with his ABCs and spends more time out of his class rather than inside.Its only when he is sent to boarding school with the hope that an iron fist will help him improve that he comes across art teacher (Aamir Khan) who correctly identities his problem of suffering from dyslexia and decides to unleash his creativity and make him an achiever.To know more one should watch this movie since it has elements that everyone could relate towards while at school or boarding, and brings into focus the need for underprivileged and slow learning children to be given the chance to prove themselves with patience and love that would help them merge with mainstream education and become worthwhile contributors.Brilliant job Aamir and your team for treating the subject with respect, honesty and flair.

10.0,This has rocked the core in me !,"I sat down in my local theatre with no expectations at all, and what I was in for, for the coming couple of hours, was just mind boggling. Taare Zameen Par might not win any awards, might not get the praise it so surely deserves, but don't let that fool you. For this movie is not just a story about Ishaan, but a masterpiece ! Ishaan is a 8 year old boy who suffers from dyslexia, no matter how hard he tries he just doesn't succeed in day to day activities. But what is mostly the case in our hard society is that people don't understand him and his shortcomings. Most of the times they paint him off as a lazy-no good-brat and this drives his father so far that he will have no more of this nonsense and sends young Ishaan off to boarding school, where he gets treatened even worse. But one day arrives Mr Ramshankar Nikumbh, a temporary art-teacher and the only person in the world that understands Ishaan's problem. Taare Zameen Par moves on as Mr Nikumbh tries to understand and help out Ishaan with his problem. This starts a journey far greater and more beautiful we could ever imagine.I have seen a thousand movies and I must say that I haven't seen a script acted out so well for quite a while now. For non-movie buffs let me explain good acting, there are a few ways to tell brilliant acting from good acting . Just look for the quality, view every character as the character itself and not as the actor behind it acting the part out. If you don't see the actor, only the character that means you are convinced of the quality of acting. A view examples, Marlon Brando played The godfather so convincingly that for years to come people didn't see Brando but Vito Corleone same goes for Pacino when he played Scarface and so forth. Taare Zameen Par is a work of great acting by everyone, it feels so real and the characters grow on to you as the movie continues. And this is very strange for a Bollywood movie. Let's be real this is the film industry who had us believing that Hritik was a jewel thief and that Abishek was a police officer, how entertaining it might be, but it just doesn't feel real. For a character to feel real, like they do in Taare Zameen Par, there is need for a great written script and clever dialogue. The actors just do what they are supposed to and the movie plays out nicely. Then there's only the editing, the background score, the location, ... to worry about. And if everything is according to a pallet, compare it to a painting, where every element blends in with the other we get a great movie. And only once in a while we witness a masterpiece and that's exactly what TZP is, and this time it's not because of Mr Khan but because of his apprentice Darsheel Safary. The young boy who played Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) is one of the best child- artists I've seen coming out of Bollywood and what a first starrer this kid got. I surely would like to see more of him in the near future. And for Aamir Khan's first movie TZP wouldn't have been the same without Safary. Although some credit goes to Mr Khan himself as well. Known to be a perfectionist, his directional debut is a clear-cut proof of this. TZP is not just a movie about kids, it's a movie about life, society and yourself as a personality. The story moves you, into nostalgic days of your childhood when you were forced and pressured by your parents or teachers, into the world of a child who is ill-treated an misunderstood, into the hard truths of our society were failure is looked down on.

10.0,Carries a lot of emotional weight and room for connection...,"I was impressed with this movie. Even more than with the Kite Runner. Mainly because it is one of the most sensitive and realistic Hindi movies that I have ever seen in my life. The first thing my sister said when we were out of the theater was ""I want that kid's autograph."" Darsheel Safary did a brilliant job as the dyslexic but cute Ishaan. I recommend that ALL parents watch this movie WITH their kids. This movie shows the effects of parental pressure, social isolation, andinspiration, of course. Aamir Khan was very provoking as the caring art teacher, Nikumbh, that recognizes young Ishaan's mental withdrawal yet his amazing ability to paint and build. It is one thing to imagine such bizarre things, but to put it on paper or construct things in an appealing way is definitely a gift. I thought that no part of the movie was melodramatic or overly done which is a major concern in Indian movies. Instead, I thought that there was a lot of promise in this movie just like how there is a promise in every child that has the motivation and faith to achieve something. And the title translated as ""Little Stars on Earth"" describes all children that are looking for this promise although they may not have everything that most children have.

I went in with huge expectations, and this movie exceeded them.Some reviews have complained about situations in the movie being too simple or repetitive in parts, but I have absolutely no problems with that. This is no thriller. You know what's going to happen, but you are looking forward to it too.The songs might not be great hits, but they gel really well with the movie.

10.0,"Taare Zameen Par: Rated ""PRG"" (Parents Required Guidance)","If all start living on their own terms, this world will be altogether a different place. Childhood is that juvenile period in life when the dreams have no boundaries and sky is the limit. It's only when the weight of someone else's dream comes on your shoulder; life turns full circle and you start as if there was no past. Resisting sticking with past raises questions to your capabilities as in this world there is only one way to get praised which is to perform the best in all the fields.This is not just a movie but this is a world from a child's view. Here 3*9 can be 3 and yes it's logical since Pluto (The 9th planet) has no more existence. Ishaan is an eight year old boy who is little different from others. Lost in his own world, always short of words but yet understands every single aspect of life. Problem with him is to express himself loudly, no one understands the way he behaves since he himself is puzzled the way things are going around him. Unclear in expressing himself, he presses his parents and teachers to start thinking that he is not one of the normal child but someone who requires special attention. This forces his demanding father to sent him to a boarding school, an eight year old boy who always lived his life in shadow of his mother couldn't adjust to this abrupt distance from her and goes into mental trauma which makes him a speechless kid, Berated by the teachers and friends around, this new world takes every color from his life until his new art teacher Ram comes in and helps him to get outside the nutshell to prove that Ishaan is no less than a brilliant artist in making.It's a lesson for all those parents who expect their child to win all the races; one has to accept that you can't have no# 1 in every house, someone has to be in lower down the order. Actual problem starts when parents start pushing their child to fulfill their own dreams which they saw but couldn't convert into realities. It's not always about being in the race and finishing first, sometimes finishing it gracefully also matters. In a way, everyone can relate to it, especially if you have grown up in India where most children are classified as dumb or unintelligent if they ""can't"" become engineers or doctors. Movie is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile, laugh, cry, nod in agreement and seethe with anger; everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think; to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more. This is outstanding heart-warming stuff, hats off to Aamir for once again taking on an off- beat topic and bringing it to life in his directorial debut. This movie surely belongs to children and their childhood.I myself have worked with kids who require help like Ishaan and I know it very well how do they feel when the world is too demanding and there is less power in you to fulfill them. I am happy that I saw this movie well in advance, now surely I am going to do justice to the new age coming.

10.0,Every child is special,"Anyone who has rated Tare Zameen Par lower than 8 out of 10 (especially those who have given it a 1 out of 10 rating) either has not seen the movie or has a heart of stone because this was an absolute beautiful and heart touching film about a relationship between a teacher and a student. I felt really sorry for the boy Eshaan and his main problem was that he has a learning disability and is always lost in his fantasy world. The film gave a terrific insight to his fantasy world by showing spinning objects around his head and by an animated sequence. The best scene was the first appearance of Aamir Khan. I have always liked Aamir Khan's films and I would put Tare Zameen Par number 2 on his top 5 best movies & number 1 would be Lagaan. The story was very uplifting, which shows that even the worst student can become the best. It was already on the IMDb top 250 when it came out and was on about 180 place but sadly not anymore and I'm disappointed. There is a huge list of crappy films that are on the top 250 but not a single Bollywood movie and this gem is original.",every child is special,anyone who has rated tare zameen par lower than 8 out 10 especially those who have given it 1 out 10 rating either has not seen movie or has heart stone because this was absolute beautiful heart touching film about relationship between teacher student i felt really sorry boy eshaan his main problem was that he has learning disability is always lost his fantasy world film gave terrific insight his fantasy world by showing spinning objects around his head by animated sequence best scene was first appearance aamir khan i have always liked aamir khans films i would put tare zameen par number 2 his top 5 best movies number 1 would be lagaan story was very uplifting which shows that even worst student can become best it was already imdb top 250 when it came out was about 180 place but sadly not anymore im disappointed there is huge list crappy films that are top 250 but not single bollywood movie this gem is original,0.641407867494824,0.27976190476190477,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.31, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,Every child is special!!! (Our answer to 400 Blows),"(I notice that there are many spoilers here already,therefore I wont go much into the plot detail)There seems to be an implied understanding that Aamir Khan represents the last word on intellectual mainstream cinema.It was many years back when he decided to curtail the number of projects he takes up in an year which was considered suicidal then but now is the norm for most of the top stars.For last 14 years this man has pushed the envelope for mainstream by taking some unprecedented risks with young directors and pulling it off time and time again.For some of us who have followed his career choices,there was a feeling that he would make a great director.His choices of films are a testimony to his understanding of the medium and the audience within the mainstream perspective.""Taare Zameen Par"" is his first directorial venture,less by design and more by circumstances.Based on the brilliant script by Amol Gupte who is one of the innovative painters and theater personalities,the story dwells into the life of boy struggling to find himself in this ruthless world.Briefly,the boy ""Ishan"" who suffers from dyslexia comes from a middle class Indian family who is unable to read/learn or identify letters.Constantly bombarded with unrelenting taunts for his poor academics and being labeled as a ""duffer"",he is isolated into his world of colors which is the only place he can seek solace in.But Ishan reaches a new low when he is packed off to boarding school by his father.The hard regimen and discipline of the school frustrates the boy out of his wits and he is finding drastic ways to put an end to his misery.He no longer feels th need to communicate .Just when things seem irrevocable,comes the art teacher,Aamir Khan,who being a dyslexic himself and working with the ""less privileged"" children identifies Ishan's troubles and can read through his silence,is sanitized by the apathy towards him.Then starts the process of resurrecting the boy's dying self belief and charting out a way for him to read and learn.The boy starts to slowly but surely come out of his shell and become a ""child"" again.One of the many aspects of a perfect film is that nothing seems to stand out,every aspect whether it be the performances,the camera work,the sound mixing,the lighting,the editing etc everything seems in sync.Same can be said about this movie.But the thing that I found overwhelming as a viewer is the music by ""Shankar""-Ehsaan-Loy"" and the lyrics by ""Prasoon Joshi"".Watch out for ""taare zameen par"",""Meri Maa"",these will definitely break you down.The cinematography by Setu is flawless and Aamir does not fall into the trap of being slick or showing off in his debut effort.(Watch how the camera is usually at Ishan's height to show his perspective,watch how slowly the camera pans into Ishan's space and how still and focused it is on his face when he is about to bare his emotions) The performances are top draw.Darsheel who plays Ishan is the crux of the film.Being the main protagonist his performance was critical to the film.I dare say,we have found a new star.The boy is brilliant in his joy,in his enthusiasm,in his loneliness as he allows us to enter his world.I feel he represents children all over the world and more critically the ""child"" within all of us.Of the support cast Tisca Chopra and Aamir Khan are brilliant as his mother and teacher respectively.Because the movie revolves around a middle class family in suburban Mumbai,I guess these characters and their emotions are something I can relate to.Finally(on the movie),kudos to Amol Gupte and Aamir Khan.Let us not forget this was Amol's baby and he had worked with children and done research for 7 years.What he came with was a near perfect script and it is only fair that he was credited as a creative director.What can I say about Aamir Khan that hasn't been said before?I think with every movie he is setting new yardsticks for Indian cinema.His movies clearly have elaborated that our movies can have all the commercial trappings yet need not be ""dumbed down"".They can be as intellectually stimulating.All I can say is that it is privilege to be in an era where this champion actor is at the absolute peak of his powers.With this movie he goes into the elite list of actors who happen to be great story tellers.But is this movie about dyslexia?Is this movie about the failure of our education system in not nurturing the individual talent but creating assembly line products?Are we as a society so obsessed with the ""idea"" of security through academics that creativity is of no accord to us?Are we preparing our children for a rat race or we preparing them for life?Are parents right in imposing their ambitions on the life they bring to this earth ?Some question that I have asked of myself before and some that I ask now.I guess the main motive of the film is as the tag line says ""every child is special"" for the talent he has.Our job is to nurture it,not mold it.p.s. I have been a frequent movie goer for last 7-8 years.But haven't seen a response like I did for this one.Everyone in the theater was in tears and simultaneous applause and is not because it was a sad film but it was ""overwhelming"".I guess there some part of Ishan in all of our lives.The second aspect that I have never witnessed in theaters before was that nobody moved till the credits were over.There is documentary on children at the end(do not miss it for anything,it is as moving as the film).",every child is special our answer 400 blows,i notice that there are many spoilers here

8.0,"""The letters are dancing.""","Over the last few weeks I've watched about a half dozen Indian movies and almost all of them star Aamir Khan and offer extended scenes of colorful song and dance numbers. Being a new film experience for me, I thought those details were worth noting, as I don't know how far that stereotype goes.The story here, though a good one for it's subject material, I thought was almost too simplistic and straightforward, as one could pretty easily figure out what the outcome would be. The learning disability that young Ishaan (Darsheel Sagary) had wasn't some big mystery, but a simple case of dyslexia. For that reason, I couldn't understand why he wasn't taken more seriously when he made the statement in my summary line above during one of his classroom experiences. It seems a perceptive teacher should have picked up on that hint long before Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Khan) came along.There's a part of me that always wants to caution about the way a certain type of message is conveyed about children. The saying that 'every child is special' bothers me somewhat, in as much as if we elevate every child to that level, then we've simply redefined what's normal. So that winds up saying that if every child is special then no child is. The better way to phrase such a concept to my mind is that every child is special to someone, and that all children have the right to every opportunity life can afford them. I don't want to give the wrong impression here. I have four grandchildren and they're all special to me, even if they're not going to be world class athletes or the next Einstein. Or maybe one of them will, who knows?With that out of the way, I have to comment on the young actor portraying Ishaan. Darsheel Safary is more talented than a lot of adult actors I've seen, and ran through an amazing arc of emotions that I simply found incredible. I really can't imagine how he pulled off some of the scenes he was required to carry. Quite amazing to my mind, enough so that I would state that in this case, he was pretty special.",letters are dancing,over last few weeks ive watched about half dozen indian movies almost all them star aamir khan offer extended scenes colorful song dance numbers being new film experience me i thought those details were worth noting as i dont know how far that stereotype goes story here though good one its subject material i thought was almost too simplistic straightforward as one could pretty easily figure out what outcome would be learning disability that young ishaan darsheel sagary had wasnt some big mystery but simple case dyslexia that reason i couldnt understand why he wasnt taken more seriously when he made statement my summary line above during one his classroom experiences it seems perceptive teacher should have picked up that hint long before ram shankar nikumbh khan came along theres part me that always wants caution about way certain type message is conveyed about children saying that every child is special bothers me somewhat as much as if we elevate every child that level then weve simply redefined whats normal so that winds up saying that if every child is special then no child is better way phrase such concept my mind is that every child is special someone that all children have right every opportunity life can afford them i dont want give wrong impression here i have four grandchildren theyre all special me even if theyre not going be world class athletes or next einstein or maybe one them will who knows with that out way i have comment young actor portraying ishaan darsheel safary is more talented than lot adult actors ive seen ran through amazing arc emotions that i simply found incredible i really cant imagine how he pulled off some scenes he was required carry quite amazing my mind enough so that i would state that this case he was pretty special,0.4887375305853566,0.18616836062488237,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.37, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.38}"
8.0,Yet another quality movie from Bollywood...oh now this is taking me by surprise...,"Its a fine Friday morning in Kolkata...the winter vacation has just commenced...we have planned a day out...gonna watch Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend...but due to last minute change of plans under unavoidable circumstances we are reluctantly drawn into the first day first show of Taare Zameen Paar...we are a bunch of movie buffs who watch a Bollywood movie once in a blue moon...within the next 2.5 hrs our opinions had changed...After back to back hits(Rang De Basanti,Fanaa)Amir khan could well have gone for another Masala flick...but it needs guts to for debut directing such a script...and then pull it off even more brilliantly...with such maturity n sensitivity...the field is teeming with great actors making for great first time directors...(Kevin Costner,Mel Gibson,George Clooney n so many others)...but never before in Bollywood have i seen a better example of this.....the film is about a 8 year old dyslexic child Ishann who finds it difficult to read or write correctly or for that matter perform any such activities normal to children of his age...n inevitably has to bear the brunt of his parents,teachers n other people he interacts with...but his world is filled with magical creatures n thoughts that gives him company...his parents unable to realize his disorder...sends him to a boarding school where the child retreats into a self imposed exile and has to contend with the added trauma of separation from his family...in comes Amir khan the temporary art teacher who encourages them to extend their boundaries of thought and imaginations...n shows special interest in finding out the difficulty of Ishaan...with time patience and care he helps Ishaan find himself...but more than the script its the way minute emotions are captured...the way the audience is made to peer into a child's mind nd its own mechanisms...scenes are a film's USP...n though you may forget the film its the scenes that u keep embedded in your heart...n TZP is laden with powerful scenes that will give you moist eyes...there's this scene where Ishan's parents had taken him home from the boarding school...n then comes to leave him there all alone again for the 2nd time...the first time Ishaan had kept staring at his parent's car leaving...this time he turned back n walked away...while his mother kept staring back...this is Ishan's own kind of protest against his parent's unjust nd cruel decision...and to complement the film's excellent theme there's the superbly crafted n maturely executed visual effects n animation to go with it...that sketches a child's world of imagination...the camera work is brilliant...top notch performance by all the actors...Darsheel Safary steals the limelight...quite explains why Amir wanted to rush into directing this film as he was worried the child may grow up..reminds of Satyajit ray n his Apu...though emotional n dramatic everything seems utterly realistic...nd Amir's directing needs special mentioning here...the way he captures a child's world...a child's obsession of noticing minute things nd finding beauty in it...like the little fishes that inhabit the roadside pond...the water filled pothole being run over by vehicles...a mother bird feeding her children...nd with so many news of children succumbing to their parent's pressure these days...the film has come out at an apt time...it will change the whole way u look at the relationship between a parent and a child i bet...its one those films which entertains nd enlightens at the same time...stop reading it any further if you haven't yet seen it..just take your child n go watch it...but everything has its share of bad sides...though it matters little i would still like to talk about the little cons...the editing work cud have been sleeker...the film tends to drag a little in the middle...although as hard as he may have tried Amir khan is unable to break away from the shackles of orthodox Bollywood treatment...nd sum scenes are just too melodramatic...like Ishan sailing a boat he has himself designed...but probably it was to draw the traditional Bollywood audience into watching this unique movie...too many songs...though good music from Shankar Ehsan Loy on all the songs...but sum were unnecessary...that's all...it would be sacrilegious to speak ill of this film any further...u r quite adamant aren't you??i thought i told you to stop reading n go watch the movie...now go nd..enjoy the brilliant world of alphabet crabs...velvet octopuses...absurd arts...nd inverse letters...is any member of KoЯn dyslexic??...a friend of mine joked...as far as I am Legend is concerned...never mind...i'm going to watch it tomorrow...",yet another quality movie bollywood oh now this is taking me by surprise,its fine friday morning kolkata winter vacation has just commenced we have planned day out gonna watch francis lawrences i am legend but due last minute change plans under unavoidable circumstances we are reluctantly drawn into first day first show taare zameen paar we are bunch movie buffs who watch bollywood

script then pull it off even more brilliantly with such maturity n sensitivity field is teeming with great actors making great first time directors kevin costner mel gibson george clooney n so many others but never before bollywood have i seen better example this film is about 8 year old dyslexic child ishann who finds it difficult read or write correctly or that matter perform any such activities normal children his age n inevitably has bear brunt his parents teachers n other people he interacts with but his world is filled with magical creatures n thoughts that gives him company his parents unable realize his disorder sends him boarding school where child retreats into self imposed exile has contend with added trauma separation his family comes amir khan temporary art teacher who encourages them extend their boundaries thought imaginations n shows special interest finding out difficulty ishaan with time patience care he helps ishaan find himself but more than script its way minute emotions are captured way audience is made peer into childs mind nd its own mechanisms scenes are films usp n though you may forget film its scenes that u keep embedded your heart n tzp is laden with powerful scenes that will give you moist eyes theres this scene where ishans parents had taken him home boarding school n then comes leave him there all alone again 2nd time first time ishaan had kept staring at his parents car leaving this time he turned back n walked away while his mother kept staring back this is ishans own kind protest against his parents unjust nd cruel decision complement films excellent theme theres superbly crafted n maturely executed visual effects n animation go with it that sketches childs world imagination camera work is brilliant top notch performance by all actors darsheel safary steals limelight quite explains why amir wanted rush into directing this film as he was worried child may grow up reminds satyajit ray n his apu though emotional n dramatic everything seems utterly realistic nd amirs directing needs special mentioning here way he captures childs world childs obsession noticing minute things nd finding beauty it like little fishes that inhabit roadside pond water filled pothole being run over by vehicles mother bird feeding her children nd with so many news children succumbing their parents pressure these days film has come out at apt time it will change whole way u look at relationship between parent child i bet its one those films which entertains nd enlightens at same time stop reading it any further if you havent yet seen it just take your child n go watch it but everything has its share bad sides though it matters little i would still like talk about little cons editing work cud have been sleeker film tends drag little middle although as hard as he may have tried amir khan is unable break away shackles orthodox bollywood treatment nd sum scenes are just too melodramatic like ishan sailing boat he has himself designed but probably it was draw traditional bollywood audience into watching this unique movie too many songs though good music shankar ehsan loy all songs but sum were unnecessary thats all it would be sacrilegious speak ill this film any further u r quite adamant arent you i thought i told you stop reading n go watch movie now go nd enjoy brilliant world alphabet crabs velvet

10.0,"A great inspiring movie for all, Every child is special","Although Bollywood releases 100s of movies every year but few of them has really left a mark on the audience for a long time. I am pretty much sure that this movie has done an excellent job for all those people who are creative but not good in academics. Many people think things differently but in India like country where competition begins at the age of 4 they are just a dumb in the society. Amir khan has done a very good job on both sides on the screen and off the screen besides he doesn't appear too often on the screen but Darsheel Safary steals the whole movie show.What a nice performance by a 8-9 year old child you are really gonna love this child. The movie brings our sweet childhood memories back.Its a mix of emotion, laugh and cry. We can imagine how we exploit children because they are not like us or they are not able to do what their parents want them to do.At the start, movie shows that how a little child(Darsheel Safary) is forced to do what he can't understand. He gets lowest marks in the class and he has failed once in class three.Sometimes he bunk the class and most of the time he has been out of the class because he don't understand how to turn a page number of the book or while reading letters dance so he can't read. After fear of being thrown him out of the school his parents put him in a boarding school.They think he is lazy and notorious.But in boarding school situation gets worse until a drawing teacher(Amir khan) gets an appointment as a temporary teacher. After that Amir teaches him in different way and ultimately he gets the success.In this movie director has taken two child one who always gets first and who is punctual for his work and other one is Darsheel Safary who is not good in academics because he can't understand letters and can't memorize too much things at a time. This movie is a motivation for all kind of child and their parents. Everyone should must watch this movie at least once. If you are too emotional then u may cry with Amir khan.",great inspiring movie all every child is special,although bollywood releases 100s movies every year but few them has really left mark audience long time i am pretty much sure that this movie has done excellent job all those people who are creative but not good academics many people think things differently but india like country where competition begins at age 4 they are just dumb society amir khan has done very good job both sides screen off screen besides he doesnt appear too often screen but darsheel safary steals whole movie show what nice performance by 8 9 year old child you are really gonna love this child movie brings our sweet childhood memories back its mix emotion laugh cry we can imagine how we exploit children because they are not like us or they are not able do what their parents want them do at start movie shows that how little child darsheel safary is forced do what he cant understand he gets lowest marks class he has failed once class three sometimes he bunk class most time he has been out class because he dont understand how turn page number book or while reading letters dance so he cant read after fear being thrown him out school his parents put him boarding school they think he is lazy notorious but boarding school situation gets worse until drawing teacher amir khan gets appointment as temporary teacher after that amir teaches him different way ultimately he gets success this movie director has taken two child one who always gets first who is punctual his work other one is darsheel safary who is not good academics because he cant understand letters cant memorize too much things at time this movie is motivation all kind child their parents everyone should must watch this movie at least once if you are too emotional then u may cry with amir khan,0.5405912698412697,0.1444910714285714,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.27}"
9.0,A splendid effort..,"First point: Taare Zameen Par is not a movie for children. Its also not a movie only about 'special' children. What it stands for and depicts stunningly is how the cruel world outside is stealing away our children's precious childhood. It is about how our parents are turning into monsters and imposing their own dreams and aspirations on their children which eventually destroys our children's confidence and can only create a generation of hate. Its about how each child needs attention and care and how we so lack those qualities in this life thats bounded by time.Aamir Khan does a fabulous job both behind and in front of the camera. There are scenes in which just his facial expressions tugs at our hearts and moves us. That is truly the hallmark of a great actor. But then, Taare Zameen Par is not about Aamir. Its truly owned by Darsheel Safary. Right from the first scene to the very end he steals the show and our hearts with his endearing acting.Taare Zameen Par is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile, laugh, cry, nod in agreement and seethe with anger.. everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think.. to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more.

10.0,In simple words  THAT'S CINEMA IN ITS PUREST FORM,"Taare Zameen Par  Words fell short as I start writing about this impressive emotional movie from ""Aamir Khan"" & his team. Unarguably the film deserves a standing ovation for its unusual content and for its near perfect execution. The impact I felt after viewing it was quite similar to what I felt after watching movies of great film makers like Bimol Roy and Guru Dutt. Aamir Khan delivers what was expected from him, an out of the routine, emotional, memorable and enlightening film which is capable of bringing changes in the lives of many families. The film revolves around a boy who is facing difficulties in studies and his teacher who comes in his life as a morning breeze. The film emphasizes completely on the character of the child, his thoughts and it's a journey into the imaginative world of his mind. The visual interpretation of what he is thinking is innovatively shot and is a visual treat to watch . Aamir Khan is a thinking brain with a heart of gold and that he has proved with his directorial venture. He has the guts of following his heart and coming out with an unconventional film like this. Another merit of the film is that it is not preachy, it teaches along with providing the required entertainment to the viewers. The film talks about a condition of a child who is finding tough to compete with his classmates but it never talks about it as a disease or a mental disorder to cure. Aamir focuses on the fact that we got to give proper attention to all kids as everyone has his own areas of abilities. He also pin points on to the parents who always want their children to score in their studies and just ignore the other aspects of life relating to art and culture. Darsheel Safary, the eight year old child has given a stunning performance. He is not acting, he is emoting his character and has done his part so well that he even overshadows the subtle and cool performance of Aamir. Another actor to watch out is Tisca Chopra as the mother of the child. She is just perfect and makes you remember the motherly touch in your childhood days. The scenes of Aamir with the father of the child are the most effective in the movie. The lyrics of Prasoon Joshi are above than the music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. They both are more impressive while watching the movie. In short, it's the movie which should be watched as a compulsion by all parents along with their children (would be parents too) and also by all the teachers who should feel the responsibility they have towards each & every child they teach. Concluding my review I would like to request my Indian film lovers that this is a movie which is meant to be watched without munching the popcorn and rightfully deserves a respectful viewing. Hats off to Aamir Khan & Thanks for giving us ""Taare Zameen Par"". The movie is simply above the star rating system",simple words thats cinema its purest form,taare zameen par words fell short as i start writing about this impressive emotional movie aamir khan his team unarguably film deserves standing ovation its unusual content its near perfect execution impact i felt after viewing it was quite similar what i felt after watching movies great film makers like bimol roy guru dutt aamir khan delivers what was expected him out routine emotional memorable enlightening film which is capable bringing changes lives many families film revolves around boy who is facing difficulties studies his teacher who comes his life as morning breeze film emphasizes completely character child his thoughts its journey into imaginative world his mind visual interpretation what he is thinking is innovatively shot is visual treat watch aamir khan is thinking brain with heart gold that he has proved with his directorial venture he has guts following his heart coming out with unconventional film like this another merit film is that it is not preachy it teaches along with providing required entertainment viewers film talks about condition child who is finding tough compete with his classmates but it never talks about it as disease or mental disorder cure aamir focuses fact that we got give proper attention all kids as everyone has his own areas abilities he also pin points parents who always want their children score their studies just ignore other aspects life relating art culture darsheel safary eight year old child has given stunning performance he is not acting he is emoting his character has done his part so well that he even overshadows subtle cool performance aamir another actor watch out is tisca chopra as mother child she is just perfect makes you remember motherly touch your childhood days scenes aamir with father child are most effective movie lyrics prasoon joshi are above than music by shankar ehsaan loy they both are more impressive while watching movie short its movie which should be watched as compulsion by all parents along with their children would be parents too also by all teachers who should feel responsibility they have towards each every child they teach concluding my review i would like request my indian film lovers that this is movie which is meant be watched without munching popcorn rightfully deserves respectful viewing hats off aamir khan thanks giving us taare zameen par movie is simply above star rating system,0.5182256235827665,0.2548280423280423,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.12, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.34}"
10.0,A children's film that would make Robin Williams proud!,"Being Aamir's directorial debut, one was sure of a didactic film. Somehow, Aamir never sets out to just tell a story or make a movie; the social message is never far away. He would almost be a Shyam Benegal if not for the dollops of humor he manages to sprinkle in his movies. The archaic belief that humor stains the ""purity"" of a serious message is the biggest mistake made, I feel, by ""art movie"" makers. A brilliant work like ""Khoya Khoya Chand (2007)"" was ruined by its droning pace and monotonic atmosphere. You look forward to Aamir's cinema because he uses humor, songs-- even pretty heroines-- to make sure his serious cinema is taken seriously!The movie is straightforward. Tells the story of a misunderstood dyslexic kid who leads a tortured life till new Teacher Aamir uncle comes and makes everything OK. Everyone is sorry they treated him bad. Happy ending! Blah Blah. Hardly a spoiler, I'd say, but you'd been warned.What I was not ready for was the dollops of tears that forced their way out of my eyes. I am a ""Kill Bill"" type of viewer and any movie with less than 100 explosions and 35 gallons of blood is usually not worth my while. Imagine my surprise when TZP easily squeezed those emotions I never knew I had. So much for ""predictability""!What makes it stick with you is the uncanny acting of the kid. I must commend Aamir's direction, in the absence of any other reason, to get so many kids to act so naturally. Move over, Mr.India! The repressed anger, the fear, the small joys and the yearning to belong. Ishaan displays everything so effortlessly it would put many matinée idols to shame. He manages all this without being corny or melodramatic. Then there is Setu's photography that captures the tiny details we all remember having watched as kids. Then forgotten in the rush to to attend the next con-call. Like the ripples made in a puddle after a car runs over, the aggressive spray of shower in the bathroom, the miracle of watching ""ice gola"" being made at Juhu beach...Finally there is Prasoon Joshi. The only reason one would watch this (like, RDB) many times over-- in theatres! Simple, non-complicated (Gulzarji, you listening?) and pedestrian lyrics. Stuff you can identify with, stuff that makes so much sense and yet sounds so poetic! Funny and sad at the same time. Added to Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music and Ram Madhvani's (of ""Let's Talk"" fame) cameo direction, each song tells a story.The innovative start credits and lovely collage during end-credits are not to be missed. The movie got a standing ovation at the Bangalore theatre we visited, from a predominantly college crowd at that.I hope it sensitizes Indian schools and society to treat all children as mere ""children"". We have to let them enjoy the colors and miracle of nature that adult life requires us to ignore. I loved this movie not so much for its message on dyslexia (although it makes a powerful statement) as for how it reminded me that I was a kid once. It reminded me how I wished those damn adults would just ""understand""! I remembered how I'd decided to ""remember"" my childhood and not change into an ""adult"". Now that I have a kid of my own, TZP is just what I needed to make sure I treat my little star with the respect he deserves and not as a ""race horse"".",childrens film that would make robin williams proud,being aamirs directorial debut one was sure didactic film somehow aamir never sets out just tell story or make movie social message is never far away he would almost be shyam benegal if not dollops humor he manages sprinkle his movies archaic belief that humor stains purity serious message is biggest mistake made i feel by art movie makers brilliant work like khoya khoya chand 2007 was ruined by its droning pace monotonic atmosphere you look forward aamirs cinema because he uses humor songs even pretty heroines make sure his serious cinema is taken seriously movie is straightforward tells story misunderstood dyslexic kid who leads tortured life till new teacher aamir uncle comes makes everything ok everyone is sorry they treated him bad happy ending blah blah hardly spoiler id say but youd been warned what i was not ready was dollops tears that forced their way out my eyes i am kill bill type viewer any movie with less than 100 explosions 35 gallons blood is usually not worth my while imagine my surprise when tzp easily squeezed those emotions i never knew i had so much predictability what makes it stick with you is uncanny acting kid i must commend aamirs direction absence any other reason get so many kids act so naturally move over mr india repressed anger fear small joys yearning belong ishaan displays everything so effortlessly it would put many matin e idols shame he manages all this without being corny or melodramatic then there is setus photography that captures tiny details we all remember having watched as kids then forgotten rush attend next con call like ripples made puddle after car runs over aggressive spray shower bathroom miracle watching ice gola being made at juhu beach finally there is prasoon joshi only reason one would watch this like rdb many times over theatres simple non complicated gulzarji you listening pedestrian lyrics stuff you can identify with stuff that makes so much sense yet sounds so poetic funny sad at same time added shankar ehsaan loys music ram madhvanis lets talk fame cameo direction each song tells story innovative start credits lovely collage during end credits are not be missed movie got standing ovation at bangalore theatre we visited predominantly college crowd at that i hope it sensitizes indian schools society treat all children as mere children we have let them enjoy colors miracle nature that adult life requires us ignore i loved this movie not so much its message dyslexia although it makes powerful statement as how it reminded me that i was kid once it reminded me how i wished those damn adults would just understand i remembered how id decided remember my childhood not change into adult now that i have kid my own tzp is just what i needed make sure i treat my little star with respect he deserves not as race horse,0.5826491960420531,0.09320887445887446,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.18, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.33}"
10.0,"Innocent, inspiring and introspective","""Every child is an artist."" -- Picasso""The child must know that he is a miracle, that since the beginning of the world there hasn't been, and until the end of the world there will not be, another child like him."" -- Pablo CasalsIt's a little while after intermission in the movie Taare Zameen Par. By this time we (the audience) have already seen that Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) is a kid who's been failing his classes at day school and is mocked as an idiot by both teachers and classmates. He has now been packed and sent to a boarding school. His parents hope this will improve his grades. In the new environment, Ishaan finds it all the more harder to understand concepts that are easy for his peers. The teachers who rap on his knuckles and the rules at the school have broken into him. He has lost the zest of a kid, he's become a zombie, deaf to the world.It's the Arts class, being taught by the temporary Arts teacher Ram Nikumbh (Aamir Khan). In the quest to understand what's been eating Ishaan, he has examined his notebooks, talked to his parents and discovered that the silent pupil in his class might be dyslexic. In this class, he starts to tell a story to the students. ""Once upon a time, there was a kid. He had trouble understanding numbers and alphabets. He couldn't read, write and study like his classmates."" He pauses, then asks ""Do you know whom I'm talking about?"" The camera now slips down to the level of the class desks and zeroes in onto the face of Ishaan. His mouth is agape, his sad eyes are looking down, and as the silent tension in the class rises, tears form, ready to roll down his face. His name will be mentioned and the students at this school too will mock him now.Ram answers his own question, ""that kid was the great scientist Albert Einstein."" Ishaan looks up and is surprised, he looks relieved that his own name wasn't brought up. Ram smiles at him and continues to tell the class how Einstein, Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and even Abhishek Bachchan had trouble with reading and writing in their youth. As we learn later, Ishaan and Einstein are not the only two possible answers to Ram's question. Ram himself is a third.That's just one of the scenes from this movie about a dyslexic kid and a teacher who discovers and helps him. It is the first directorial attempt by Aamir Khan. AK is the only Bollywood hero I admire and I saw the movie today on its release weekend. And loved it! It's a bit long, it might be AK's baby, but he should've edited it a bit. Other that that, I was positively moved by it. There were many scenes that were absolutely golden, some even brought a tear to my eye. Watch out for the one where Ishaan floats his propeller boat (made of sticks, pencils, corks and rubber-bands) in the school pond and it slowly makes its way towards Ram. That scene is both moving and metaphorical. There are many more like that.How do you even attempt to show the audience how the world looks to a kid, a dyslexic one? Using beautiful cinematography, attention to detail (observe how the camera is usually at the kid's height, not adult height) and sometimes story-telling animation (remember Calvin and his space adventures?) we get to see how Ishaan relishes the simple sights and sounds of the real world, while at the same time is being hounded by the terrors of his textbooks. This is the finest attempt I've ever seen in a movie (Hollywood or Bollywood) to show how a kid sees the adult world. Brilliant scripting and story-telling, AK the director rules!The background music is top notch, the title track and its music is superb, but the other songs are just OK. AK doesn't even enter the movie until the intermission and even after that he is just a secondary character. Darsheel Safary owns this movie!!! It's his show all the way from the start to the end. Acting that is so brilliant that you can't call it acting. Ishaan has a strict (but caring) father, a loving mother and a helpful elder brother, all of whom are characterized very realistically. I'm willing to bet that you will laugh in some scenes and cry in some of the moving scenes, especially with his mom and him.I found the movie to be both inspiring and introspective. Dyslexia actually occupies a very small piece of the movie and its message -- that each kid is unique and his/her creative imagination needs to be handled with care by parents, teachers and society.
