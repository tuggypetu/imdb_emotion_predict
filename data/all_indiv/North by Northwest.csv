10.0,What an Action Thriller Should Be.,"VERTIGO did nothing to advance Hitchcock's career in 1957 when he released it, and it's actually not a shame: the following year he decided to go completely against the slow-moving erotic thriller genre and do something shamelessly commercial, escapist and single-handedly create the spy movie. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, states he based his character on the physical characteristics and the suave personality of Cary Grant, as an added note. This could well amount to be the first James Bond film -- a dangerous villain complete with a sidekick, an alluring woman with a dubious nature and an enigmatic ""boss,"" a dashing hero, lush locales setting the scene for powerful chases and escalating danger.NORTH BY NORTHWEST has one crucial difference to any James Bond film, though: Alfred Hitchcock. While the Bond films have been seen as quintessential action fluff (although fluff of the better kind until the franchise ran out of gas in the 80s), Hitchcock, always the master of subtext as well as suspense, creates memorable scenes that balance sexual tension, sexual innuendo, comedy, and mounting suspense seamlessly. There is never the feeling of being bored as there is too much going on, especially with the sizzling chemistry of Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant, by now a Hitchcock veteran. When they're on screen, dialog crackles and so much more is said with so little gesture -- she closes the lid on her Ice Goddess role, but gives it a nice, cheeky, knowing wink. He of course evolves from the sort of man who while looking and being slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb -- once it becomes clear he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot that only later becomes clear -- becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands. A quintessential Hitchcock Everyman, Grant has his stamp all over his role. No one can imagine anyone else running away from that crop duster in one of the movies many standout sequences, or saying the reassuring last words to Eva Marie Saint as they cuddle together in the train. When one thinks of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, one thinks Cary Grant.Easily one of Hitchcock's best films, made while he was at the peak of his career in the bracket formed with THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and MARNIE. Great supporting performances are all over the map, from Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother, James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, Martin Landau as Vandamm's protégée who might be a little more than that, and Leo G Carroll as The Professor. Doreen Lang appears early in the movie as Grant's secretary; she would of course be remembered as the woman who shrieks at Tippi Hedren in THE BIRDS and gets slapped by her as the camera holds itself tight on her face.",what action thriller should be,vertigo did nothing advance hitchcocks career 1957 when he released it its actually not shame following year he decided go completely against slow moving erotic thriller genre do something shamelessly commercial escapist single handedly create spy movie ian fleming author james bond novels states he based his character physical characteristics suave personality cary grant as added note this could well amount be first james bond film dangerous villain complete with sidekick alluring woman with dubious nature enigmatic boss dashing hero lush locales setting scene powerful chases escalating danger north by northwest has one crucial difference any james bond film though alfred hitchcock while bond films have been seen as quintessential action fluff although fluff better kind until franchise ran out gas 80s hitchcock always master subtext as well as suspense creates memorable scenes that balance sexual tension sexual innuendo comedy mounting suspense seamlessly there is never feeling being bored as there is too much going especially with sizzling chemistry eva marie saint cary grant by now hitchcock veteran when theyre screen dialog crackles so much more is said with so little gesture she closes lid her ice goddess role but gives it nice cheeky knowing wink he course evolves sort man who while looking being slightly clumsy under his mothers thumb once it becomes clear hes been marked is target sinister plot that only later becomes clear becomes more assertive taking matters into his own hands quintessential hitchcock everyman grant has his stamp all over his role no one can imagine anyone else running away that crop duster one movies many standout sequences or saying reassuring last words eva marie saint as they cuddle together train when one thinks north by northwest one thinks cary grant easily one hitchcocks best films made while he was at peak his career bracket formed with man who knew too much marnie great supporting performances are all over map jesse royce landis as grants mother james mason as phillip vandamm martin landau as vandamms prot g e who might be little more than that leo g carroll as professor doreen lang appears early movie as grants secretary she would course be remembered as woman who shrieks at tippi hedren birds gets slapped by her as camera holds itself tight her face,0.4944139194139193,0.15400641025641024,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.1, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.39}"
,Classic thriller - I love it!,"Roger Thornhill is an advertising man. However when he is kidnapped it is clear that he has been mistaken for someone else. When he tries to find out what's going he is framed for murder and sets out on a cross country run to survive. Along the way he meets danger, adventure and beauty in the shape of the mysterious Eve Kendall. However when he finds the truth he is drawn towards a final showdown with the dangerous Vandamm.Rightly regarded as a classic and can more than compete with today's thrillers that too often rely on special effects to make up for the lack of genuine suspense. Here the plot requires a great deal of faith, but it is brought off with such style and energy that it is totally absorbing. The action is great and the several main scenes have become part of popular culture and are regularly spoofed on TV etc. The romance works as well and Thornhill and Kendall exchange plenty of good scenes.The dialogue is great and the direction is faultless from Hitchcock. Many thrillers run over 2 hours - but only the good ones can stand up to repeated viewings. Northwest can take back to back viewings it is so good. The plot may have been put together as shooting went (as was the case with at leastone key scene) but it all stands together well. The acting is also perfect, Grant's rebirth as a thriller man is brilliant and is one of Hitchcock's best everyman characters. Marie-Saint is yet another dangerous blonde but is very good. James `The Voice' Mason is excellent, while Landau adds great homosexual subtext to his character. The ever present Leo G Carroll IS Mr Waverly but is still enjoyable and even support roles like Landis as Thornhill's mother is perfection!Over 40 years on this film has barely dated. Hearing the music is enough to make me want to see it again, while the direction, set pieces, dialogue and performances are all pitch perfect.

10.0,Strangers on a train,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the best films in his long and distinguished career. Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, ""North by Northwest"" was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really happening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of the same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences involving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and Roger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his work with the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grant played, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is perfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture. James Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast is excellent.""North by Northwest"" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best crafted films thanks to the brilliant people that came together to work in it.",strangers train,alfred hitchcocks north by northwest is one best films his long distinguished career part success movie lies screen play by ernest lehman one best writers that era also haunting music by mr hitchcocks usual collaborator bernard hermann adds texture what we are seeing together with all above mentioned qualities north by northwest was photographed by robert burks was edited by george tomasini both men did outstanding jobs enhance film that shows mature inspired alfred hitchcock film works because witty dialog mr lehman wrote this has be one riskiest projects undertaken by mr hitchcock because sexiness eva kendall exudes throughout film repartee between her roger thornhill film mixes adventure romance that arent put ons as one feels what ones watching be really happening much has been said this forum as values this classic so we shall only add our pleasure seeing this masterpiece any time it turns cable fact film hasnt dated way some others same period have highlights film are sequences involving crop duster train ride chicago where eve roger first meet auction mount rushmore climax this is one best contributions by cary grant any his work with director roger thornhill is one best roles mr grant played during his long career his chemistry with eva marie saint is perfect this young actress added class elegance picture james mason martin landau played villains convincingly jesse royce landis leo g carroll rest supporting cast is excellent north by northwest is one alfred hitchcocks best crafted films thanks brilliant people that came together work it,0.4423076923076923,0.416025641025641,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.33, 'Sad': 0.16, 'Fear': 0.37}"
9.0,Enormously entertaining film from Alfred Hitchcock!,"My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock's direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people's heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10.

8.0,I finally get how great it is: Hitch infuses his wrong-man caper with ironic movie language and reality-be-damned escapism and suspense.,"Its Hitch's most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.I've finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront. Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock ""as if he'd keep driving"" or ""as if she'd do that"" - he would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.10/10",i finally get how great it is hitch infuses his wrong man caper with ironic movie language reality be damned escapism suspense,its hitchs most briskly entertaining movie one his most comic adventure caper type movies largely thanks persona cary grant but its also one his most suspenseful fact that grant is being recognised as someone else that he may be put jail someone elses crime ive finally come realise just how great north by northwest is reason you should love hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront hitchcock was not interested whether this or that would happen real life he was interested what would make most entertaining scene movie north by northwest is peak this regard dialogue situations intentionally throw reality wind double entendre dialogue love scenes is not supposed be way people talk if you said hitchcock as if hed keep driving or as if shed do that he would just laugh at you say youve missed point this is 100 movieland once you get used fact that this is not fault film but done intentionally youll love it its expressionistic everything happens movie language people laughing at grant elevator way he keeps driving drunk near beginning way he grabs knife everyone stares at him after someones been stabbed it flirts with idea identity i thought it was interesting how grant first is dismissing then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name then as tries find out who this guy is he enters hotel room this new identity then he puts suit finally he identifies himself as george kaplan succession fantastic memorable scenes great leading man grant one hermanns essential hitch scores make movie i can put at any time 10 10,0.5896536796536795,0.25318181818181823,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.27, 'Fear': 0.33}"
,"Wonderful comedy thriller, not Hitchcock's best but his most sheerly enjoyable","North By Northwest is not an artistic masterpiece like Rear Window and Vertigo, but it is probably the most purely entertaining picture Hitchcock ever made. It's essentially a rehash of many of his earlier films, with a plot partially derived from The Thirty Nine Steps and the very similar Saboteur, while there are borrowings from Foreign Correspondent and Notorious, among others. However, it is all done with such style and confidence that it doesn't matter if it's essentially just a greatest hits package.Very few other films of this kind attain the near perfect tone of this one, precariously balanced between seriousness and silliness. Sometimes this film manages the very difficult trick of being both suspenseful and comical at the same time, as in the auction house scene, or the wonderful scene in the lift when the hero's mother turns to two heavies in a lift looking menacingly at the hero and says ""you gentlemen are not REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?"".Of course the famous crop dusting plane scene and the Mount Rushmore chase are terrific. The former is really more notable for the amount of time taken to build up to the action than the action itself, while the technical work on the latter still looks pretty good. In a totally different vein is the astonishingly frank seduction sequence on the train. Hitchcock takes his time here as with many of the other scenes, but the film is so crammed with memorable passages that one hardly notices it's 136 mins long.Ernest Lehman's script is full of wonderful lines, many of them delivered so well by chief villain James Mason that at times we almost want to root for him. ""Has any one ever told you tend to overplay your various roles Mr Kaplan....it seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the FBI and a little more from the Actor's Studio"". Cary Grant is so smooth one almost forgets he's over 50, and of course there's also Bernard Herrmann's vibrant score.Endlessly enjoyable even with repeated viewings.

,"A perfect film for a rainy, cold October day","I saw this film for the first time when I was a freshman in college as part of an english class I took entitled ""writing and the movies"". Little did I realize that I would be seeing a film that would stay with me to this day and in essence become one of my all time favorites. Then, a few years ago, I caught it on the big screen at the Fine Arts theater in downtown Chicago. I remember that it was a rainy, cold October day. Perfect weather for a Hitchcock film I thought to myself.For me, half of the fun of North by Northwest is its incredible story. This film has something for everyone within it: a little comedy, a little romance, great snappy dialogue and more action than any Bruce Willis Die Hard film combined. Hitchcock was a master at this and in North by Northwest he lets his genius shine through totally. It seems to me that whenever I watch it, everyone who made this film from Cary Grant on down had nothing but sheer fun making it. Perhaps my two favorite scenes are the infamous ""crop-duster"" sequence and the last twenty minutes or so at Mount Rushmore. I must give special mention to Ernest Lehman who yet again managed to write a screenplay that totally knocks your socks off. How he came up with the idea, I've not a clue, but what an idea it is. The screenplay itself was nominated for an Academy Award that year, but lost to Pillow Talk. North by Northwest was also nominated for Best Set Decoration and Best Film Editing, but lost to Ben-Hur in both categories.All in all, what a film. If you haven't seein it, do so ASAP. North by Northwest just reinforces my belief that Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest directors of all time.

8.0,"Smoke and mirrors, without apologies","The one famous gaffe people point out in this film is when a small boy can be seen plugging his ears just before Eva Marie Saint brings her café conversation with Cary Grant to a sudden end. Another gaffe, just as egregious and apparent but not nearly as commented on, is when Cary and Eva, clutching an incriminating statute, are rock-climbing around a quartet of famous presidential heads until a bad guy suddenly appears and leaps upon him. Whereupon the surprised, backward-falling Cary has the presence of mind to hand the statute to Eva, who takes his from him whilst in mid-scream. Do me a favor and read that last sentence again. What director today would allow such a scene past the editing room?But it just doesn't matter: IMDB voters at this writing have placed the 44-year-old `North By Northwest' ahead of all but 18 movies ever made, including 14 which have nothing to do with Frodo Baggins or Darth Vader. That's pretty damn impressive. What the hell were they thinking? The only Hitchcock movie they rate higher is ""Rear Window;"" I can think of at least seven or eight Hitchcocks I'd rank over ""North By Northwest."" [None of them are ""Rear Window.""]The truth is this film is so popular because it is so good. Not great, but very, very good, in a way that anticipates a lot of the direction of mass entertainment to come and thus speaks to people in a way `Vertigo' or `Strangers On A Train' do not. People talk about how forward thinking ""Psycho"" is, and it is, but more directors took note of the just-as-clever-but-more-mainstream approach of ""North By Northwest."" The last four decade have been chock full of flicks serving up suspense, sex, changing locales, and plot twists that play with viewers' expectations, all the while keeping the laughs coming. It's not like ""North By Northwest"" invented this formula, but it perfected and distilled it into an essence that is imitated, with varying success, to this day.Cary Grant plays slick adman Roger Thornhill, who gets mistaken for a fugitive named Kaplan and finds himself on the run from a slew of bad guys, led by James Mason at his smug and oily peak as Vandamme. Martin Landau makes his first memorable appearance as Mason's nastiest henchman Leonard (1959 was good to him, as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" premiered that year as well), suspicious, ruthless, and probably gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it was 1959 and that was a little daring.Daring also is Eva Marie Saint's Eve Kendall, a woman who uses sex, as Thornhill puts it, ""the way some people use a flyswatter."" Her repartee with Thornhill shows just how erotic two people just talking to each other can be. It also provides further evidence Hitchcock's writers didn't go out on many dates. (Kendall: ""I'm a big girl."" Thornhill: ""Yeah, and in all the right places."" And she KISSES him for it!)The film does chug slowly at the outset, building suspense but also bugging you a bit as the plot gears grind while Thornhill is being pushed through his early paces, right until his moment at the UN. About the time we find ourselves with Thornhill in the cornfield, the picture starts to pick up a serious head of steam, and never loses it all the way to the final, famous tunnel shot. Actually, I like the penultimate scene between Grant and Saint, an elegant and witty way of resolving that most tried-and-true device, the cliffhanger.As with most of Hitchcock's 50s fare, elegance is behind much of what makes this movie so great. `North By Northwest' manifests an elegance in dress, decor, language, music, and lighting that represents the best of its era while giving the picture a timeless character all the same. Hitchcock's camera movements are very subtle yet brilliant, as during Mason's entrance and Grant's hide-and-seek game around the train. Everyone has perfect hair, lounges about in gowns and jackets, and you never think it should be otherwise.Grant isn't my favorite actor, but he's smooth enough for the central role when he's not doing that bad Foster Brooks impression behind the wheel of the car. [I docked the movie one point just for that.] His best scene may be at the auction, though he projects real fear in the cornfield. Saint is simply splendid, nailing every line as she walks a tightrope and plays her character's motives close to her décolletage. Hitchcock seemed to lose his ability to direct female actors, and not merely bask in them, with the advent of color, but Saint is one blonde bombshell that gives us a sense of brains and personality behind her mystery.There's logic gaps in this movie, and bad process shots, but it's an amazing ride all the same, more amazing because it's done with smoke and mirrors and without apologies. You ask the questions and figure out the loopholes only after you walk away, because the movie doesn't let you up much while you are watching it. Hitchcock made other, more challenging movies that attested to his rare vision as an artist, but this is maybe his purest exercise in the craft of good filmmaking.

,Terrific Entertainment From the Master,"With everything you expect from Hitchcock and more, ""North By Northwest"" is terrific entertainment from the master. There are interesting characters, an exciting story with intrigue and suspense, lots of fine photography, and some of Hitchcock's best-known set pieces. It's capped off by a fine Bernard Herrmann score that is almost as good as the one he wrote later for ""Psycho"".Cary Grant may be the ideal Hitchcock actor, and he is a big part of making this such great fun. As one of the man-on-the-run characters that Hitchcock loved to make movies about, Grant is entertaining and believable, maintaining good humor even as he tries to work his way out of a series of desperate situations. The other stars, James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, also are very good, and the supporting roles are all filled by good character actors.The story is one of Hitchcock's most exciting. It's slightly longer than usual, and it occasionally stretches credibility, but it all goes by quickly because there is always something interesting going on, and there is also plenty to look at. Whether using the famous landmarks or using more everyday settings, there is always lots of good detail, and the settings complement the story nicely. At times the plot becomes somewhat fanciful, but probably deliberately so, for it only emphasizes Hitchcock's mastery of technique that he can have his characters do almost anything and make you believe it at the time.With everything that characterizes Hitchcock at his very best, this fully deserves its reputation as one of the finest films by him or any other director. You can watch it several times and still find it just as entertaining.",terrific entertainment master,with everything you expect hitchcock more north by northwest is terrific entertainment master there are interesting characters exciting story with intrigue suspense lots fine photography some hitchcocks best known set pieces its capped off by fine bernard herrmann score that is almost as good as one he wrote later psycho cary grant may be ideal hitchcock actor he is big part making this such great fun as one man run characters that hitchcock loved make movies about grant is entertaining believable maintaining good humor even as he tries work his way out series desperate situations other stars james mason eva marie saint also are very good supporting roles are all filled by good character actors story is one hitchcocks most exciting its slightly longer than usual it occasionally stretches credibility but it all goes by quickly because there is always something interesting going there is also plenty look at whether using famous landmarks or using more everyday settings there is always lots good detail settings complement story nicely at times plot becomes somewhat fanciful but probably deliberately so it only emphasizes hitchcocks mastery technique that he can have his characters do almost anything make you believe it at time with everything that characterizes hitchcock at his very best this fully deserves its reputation as one finest films by him or any other director you can watch it several times still find it just as entertaining,0.5618992248062016,0.33395348837209304,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.27, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.14, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.33}"
9.0,Superb Hitchcock Thriller!,"""North By Northwest"" is another of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers where an ordinary man is put into an extraordinary situation. As in most of these movies, the hero has to quickly adapt to his situation or perish. This time it is Cary Grant who is thrust into a world of international intrigue when is mistaken by villain James Mason for an American operative named George Kaplan (the film's ""McGuffan"" by the way). Along the way he is seduced by Mason's mistress (Eva Marie Saint) while being pursued by Mason and his cronies from New York to Chicago to South Dakota and ultimately to Mount Rushmore for the film's climax. ""North By Northwest"" is full of classic Hitchcock moments. First,there is Grant's frustration and fear as he tries to explain to Mason that he is not the person they are seeking. Next, the scene in the cornfield where Grant is isolated and attacked by a plane is pure Hitchcock. Then we have the art auction where he cleverly escapes Mason's henchmen and finally, the finale at Mount Rushmore in a scene reminiscent of a similar one in ""Sabotage"" (1942) (which took place at the top of the Statue of Liberty). The cast, as in most Hitchcock films is excellent. Grant is understandably confused and frightened as the the hero, Eva Marie Saint has never been sexier as the femme fatale, James Mason is suave and sinister as the villain and Martin Landau in an early role, is good as Mason's chief henchman. Hitchcock regular Leo G. Carroll is cold heartedly sinister as the ""professor"". Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother (she was about Grant's real age) is wasted and unnecessary to the plot. The only problem that I have with this and other Hitchcock films is his over reliance on back projection and soundstage ""exteriors"". Other than that. ""North By Northwest"" has to be considered as one of Hitchcock's best. Watch for Hitchcock's hilarious cameo appearance at the end of the opening credits.",superb hitchcock thriller,north by northwest is another alfred hitchcocks thrillers where ordinary man is put into extraordinary situation as most these movies hero has quickly adapt his situation or perish this time it is cary grant who is thrust into world international intrigue when is mistaken by villain james mason american operative named george kaplan films mcguffan by way along way he is seduced by masons mistress eva marie saint while being pursued by mason his cronies new york chicago south dakota ultimately mount rushmore films climax north by northwest is full classic hitchcock moments first there is grants frustration fear as he tries explain mason that he is not person they are seeking next scene cornfield where grant is isolated attacked by plane is pure hitchcock then we have art auction where he cleverly escapes masons henchmen finally finale at mount rushmore scene reminiscent similar one sabotage 1942 which took place at top statue liberty cast as most hitchcock films is excellent grant is understandably confused frightened as hero eva marie saint has never been sexier as femme fatale james mason is suave sinister as villain martin landau early role is good as masons chief henchman hitchcock regular leo g carroll is cold heartedly sinister as professor jesse royce landis as grants mother she was about grants real age is wasted unnecessary plot only problem that i have with this other hitchcock films is his over reliance back projection soundstage exteriors other than that north by northwest has be considered as one hitchcocks best watch hitchcocks hilarious cameo appearance at end opening credits,0.5411789964421544,0.12501708817498292,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.16, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.43}"
,Worth it just to see the the crop duster chase,"I can't quite understand how anyone can dislike Alfred Hitchcock's films. Personally, he's one of the few old school talents I find interesting and watchable, even if his work is dated and set in its era (the era when most sets were hopelessly phony). I guess you have to appreciate his themes - dysfunctional relationships between a man and his mother, flawed by essentially innocent men caught up in a web of intrigue, beautiful blonds, comments of authority figures, black humor, etc - to really appreciate Hitchcock.Interestingly, James Stewart was Hitchcock's original choice for the role of Roger Thornhill, the hapless ad man who is mistaken for a spy who doesn't even exist to begin with and is chased half way across the country by villains and authorities for a murder he didn't commit. For one reason or another, Stewart was unavailable and the part went to Cary Grant instead. Grant seems better suited to the character and the situation than Stewart would have been, but I can easily picture Stewart being chased in the cornfield by the crop duster.Like all Hitchcock films, there are hundreds of things that aren't realistic though set in the real world and lots of highly improbable stuff going on everywhere, but if you give it a chance you'll enjoy it and won't care. Don't miss Eva Marie Saint having to dub over a then lewd line about love, a full stomach and sex. The use of a crop duster may not be the most practical way to kill a man, but it's a great visual representation of the great Hitchcockian examination of ""nowhere to run, nowhere to hide"". The music and clinging to Mount Rushmore is also memorable.

10.0,Top-notch suspense /adventure film still looks great after 40 years!,"For Christmas this year, I received my first to-own DVD: Hitchcock's classic, NORTH BY NORTHWEST. After over 40 years, this rip-racing adventure-thriller still packs a punch and looks great on widescreen. This movie came along during a renaissance period for the Old Master, between masterpieces like VERTIGO and PSYCHO, but this excursion into the world of suspense is so different from anything else Hitchcock had created up to that point. Never did he challenge our endurance to keep still in our seats for such a long period of time, and yet the film's 135 minutes go by so fast it could only be explained by movie magic itself.Cary Grant is one of those actors that a filmgoer either falls in love with or deeply envies. His debonair manner is displayed to the full in this film, even though the peril that his character goes through would cause any normal dude to break into a maddening sweat. The dialogue Roger Thornhill delivers alongside Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) in this film is sometimes too hilarious to be true, but wouldn't any woman fall for it? (I'm merely guessing here) Ernest Lehman's screenplay is so lighthearted and yet very ominous. With all the traps and pitfalls Grant goes through in this film, you would have to find comedy in it. Grant does and to great appeal. I absolutely love the sequence at the auction when Roger tries to get himself arrested by yelling out flaky bids and accusing the auctioneer of selling junk worth no more than $8. I also admire the scenes with Saint on the train to Chicago; I was tempted to jot down some of his pick-up lines, but then I realized it's just a movie (or is it?)Hitchcock was famous throughout his career of setting up death-defying sequences with major landmarks as backdrops. Here, Mount Rushmore will never be looked at the same again afterwards. We may never enter the United Nations again without peering behind our backs for a notorious knife-thrower. And, I dare say, I will never walk alongside a highway where a cropduster could swoop at any minute. I love the line during the Rushmore incident when Grant says his two ex-wives left him because he lived too dull a life. Go figure!It has been said that Hitchcock's many films each contain a personal side of the director inside them. The archetypes of the Master of Suspense are here amid the chasing and running across the U.S. The mysterious blonde, played to a tee by Eva Marie Saint, is a common fixture of many Hitchcock jaunts. Saint joins Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren in this feature. The protagonist is again awkward when faced with the opposite sex, but unusually casual when wrapped up in danger. The hero has an attachment to his mother, continually under his nurturing wing. And of course, the macguffin has fun with us again (government secrets my foot!)Whenever I see action-packed epics today like ""The Fugitive"" or the James Bond series, they all seem to quiver in comparison to this film. It amazes me that Hitchcock is able to hold the audience in the palm of his hand throughout the whole length of the journey. We become Grant as he runs away from the police and the secret agents who have chosen him as their dupe. But throughout the squabble, we sense that Grant is getting off on the whole jaunt, just as we want the chase to continue, not looking at our watches for a minute. However, it's fascinating to note that Roger Thornhill is not a born adventurer, nor is he an archeologist with a flair for escaping impossible situations. We are experiencing the Cary Grant in all of us, running away from an enemy we do not know they are or what they want. Is this symbolism of some kind? I say who cares; just watch the film and have fun!",top notch suspense adventure film still looks great after 40 years,christmas this year i received my first own dvd hitchcocks classic north by northwest after over 40 years this rip racing adventure thriller still packs punch looks great widescreen this movie came along during renaissance period old master between masterpieces like vertigo psycho but this excursion into world suspense is so different anything else hitchcock had created up that point never did he challenge our endurance keep still our seats such long period time yet films 135 minutes go by so fast it could only be explained by movie magic itself cary grant is one those actors that filmgoer either falls love with or deeply envies his debonair manner is displayed full this film even though peril that his character goes through would cause any normal dude break into maddening sweat dialogue roger thornhill delivers alongside eve kendall eva marie saint this film is sometimes too hilarious be true but wouldnt any woman fall it im merely guessing here ernest lehmans screenplay is so lighthearted yet very ominous with all traps pitfalls grant goes through this film you would have find comedy it grant does great appeal i absolutely love sequence at auction when roger tries get himself arrested by yelling out flaky bids accusing auctioneer selling junk worth no more than 8 i also admire scenes with saint train chicago i was tempted jot down some his pick up lines but then i realized its just movie or is it hitchcock was famous throughout his career setting up death defying sequences with major landmarks as backdrops here mount rushmore will never be looked at same again afterwards we may never enter united nations again without peering behind our backs notorious knife thrower i dare say i will never walk alongside highway where cropduster could swoop at any minute i love line during rushmore incident when grant says his two ex wives left him because he lived too dull life go figure it has been said that hitchcocks many films each contain personal side director inside them archetypes master suspense are here amid chasing running across u s mysterious blonde played tee by eva marie saint is common fixture many hitchcock jaunts saint joins grace kelly tippi hedren this feature protagonist is again awkward when faced with opposite sex but unusually casual when wrapped up danger hero has attachment his mother continually under his nurturing wing course macguffin has fun with us again government secrets my foot whenever i see action packed epics today like fugitive or james bond series they all seem quiver comparison this film it amazes me that hitchcock is able hold audience palm his hand throughout whole length journey we become grant as he runs away police secret agents who have chosen him as their dupe but throughout squabble we sense that grant is getting off whole jaunt just as we want chase continue not looking at our watches minute however its fascinating note that roger thornhill is not born adventurer nor is he archeologist with flair escaping impossible situations we are experiencing cary grant all us running away enemy we do not know they are or what they want is this symbolism some kind i say who cares just watch film have fun,0.5387840670859539,0.15689203354297696,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.15, 'Fear': 0.4}"

NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soignée Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy.

My husband and I have joked that if Mason had played Thornhill, the film would have been over in mere moments. With all due respect to Grant, if the imperious, unshakably confident Mason asked the Glen Cove police, ""Do you honestly believe that this happened the way you think it did?"" they would immediately reply, ""No, sir, you must be right, you're free to go, sorry we bothered you."" :-) Also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores.

,My Favorite Hitch,"""North by Northwest"" is my favorite of all Hitchcock films (a close shave with ""Rear Window""), and it permanently occupies a slot in my Personal Top Ten Films of All Time.Grant is terrific--funny, sexy, angry, confused, exhausted, redeemed. It is a full-bodied performance. And speaking of bodies--Eva Marie Saint is *definitely* an asset here, not just for her looks (there's that cool, blond Hitch femme fatale again) but for showing off her acting chops as well.James Mason is a consumate actor, and Hitch gives him a vehicle to enter one of his finest performances. Martin Landau, too, is appropriately chilling.Favorite scenes? The crop-dusting sequence is certainly a classic. But I love the scenes with Roger and his mother, dickering over his ""drunkenness."" And the auction is Hitch in his element: the scene plays tense and terse but also funny.I can quibble with this film: The blue-screening looks a bit cheesy nowadays. And the movie opens with a huge plot hole (when the page is searching for George Kaplan and Thornhill grabs his ear for a quick question, Mason et.al. believe Thornhill to be their man, setting off the entire plot. However, shouldn't the page have continued searching the room, calling for Mr. Kaplan? And shouldn't the villains have heard him continue to page, knowing that Thornhill wasn't who they assumed he was? Ahh, but that would blow the whole movie!).This film also contains the best ""naughty joke"" Hitchcock ever devised. The final sequence is Eva Marie Saint and Grant pulling each other into bed. The jump cut is to a train entering a tunnel. You figure it out.",my favorite hitch,north by northwest is my favorite all hitchcock films close shave with rear window it permanently occupies slot my personal top ten films all time grant is terrific funny sexy angry confused exhausted redeemed it is full bodied performance speaking bodies eva marie saint is definitely asset here not just her looks theres that cool blond hitch femme fatale again but showing off her acting chops as well james mason is consumate actor hitch gives him vehicle enter one his finest performances martin landau too is appropriately chilling favorite scenes crop dusting sequence is certainly classic but i love scenes with roger his mother dickering over his drunkenness auction is hitch his element scene plays tense terse but also funny i can quibble with this film blue screening looks bit cheesy nowadays movie opens with huge plot hole when page is searching george kaplan thornhill grabs his ear quick question mason et al believe thornhill be their man setting off entire plot however shouldnt page have continued searching room calling mr kaplan shouldnt villains have heard him continue page knowing that thornhill wasnt who they assumed he was ahh but that would blow whole movie this film also contains best naughty joke hitchcock ever devised final sequence is eva marie saint grant pulling each other into bed jump cut is train entering tunnel you figure it out,0.6505376344086021,0.10940860215053765,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.21, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.35}"
6.0,Okay....But It Seemed A Lot Better When I Was A Kid,"When I started collecting videos in earnest (by the thousands), I was excited to get this film. I had such fond remembrances of seeing it on the big screen when I was young teen. I remember being terrified when Cary Grant was being chased by the crop duster and then awed at the end with the climactic scene on Mount Rushmore. I saw it maybe a decade or so later on television and enjoyed it again.Well, seeing the film again five years ago on DVD as a 50-something-year-old turned out to be a major disappointment, mainly because the first hour was so boring. The beginning had scenes that looked too dated and worse, were drawn out too long, such as Grant's drunk scene and the romance between he and Eva Marie Saint.Once Grant goes on the run, the story improves noticeably and mixing in some comedy with the drama was a good move. From that point, it's still the fun film I had remembered but, overall, didn't have the suspense anymore and, to this day, I believe is an overrated Alfred Hitchcock film.

The tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses , as a hapless New York advertising executive , Roger Thornhill, (Gary Grant got $450,000 -a substantial amount for the time - plus a percentage of the gross profits ; though Yul Brynner and William Holden was suggested to play him) is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies (James Mason , Martin Landau) and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive . Grant is chased by both : the patrolmen who think he's a killer and a spy ring who think he is a double agent . He is helped by a gorgeous train passenger named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint , though the studio wanted Cyd Charisse or Sophia Loren for the female lead, and she wanted to do it, but contractual problems resulted in her having to turn it down for the part , but Hitchcock insisted upon Eva Marie Saint) .Enjoyable mystery movie involves a bewildered ad-man who hold numerous tricks in order to escape from his captors and being chased cross country . Entertaining suspense movie packs humor , intrigue and ordinary Hitch touches . This agreeable and often hilarious picture from master of suspense has a memorable scene after another and was the only film Alfred Hitchcock made for MGM . Alfred Hitchcock's films have become famous for a number of elements and iconography : vertiginous height , innocent men wrongfully accused , blonde bombshells , voyeurism, long non-dialogue sequences , a matter of mistaken identity etc. This film has these particularities ; furthermore contains a fun intrigue , amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . Hitch was famous for making his actors follow the script to the word, and in this movie the characters use their dialogue taken from an interesting as well as fun screenplay by Ernest Lehman . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks such as Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco convent in ¨Vertigo¨ and the Statue of Liberty in ¨Sabotage¨ . Here includes Mount Rushmore images and now-legendary scenes such as crop-dusting plane sequences and the train station scene that was shot in New York City's Grand Central Terminal .Alfred Hitchcock couldn't get permission to film inside the UN, so footage was made of the interior of the building using a hidden camera, and the rooms were later recreated on a soundstage . Very good support cast such as James Mason , Martin Landau , Josephine Hutchinson , Les Tremayne as auctioneer and Jessie Royce Landis as mummy , though she was only 7 years older than Cary Grant, who plays her son . Features two actors who would go on to head spy agencies in their own 1960s television series. Edward Platt would star as ""Chief"" in ¨Get Smart¨, and Leo G. Carroll would star in ¨The man from U.N.C.L.E . And of course , Alfred Hitchcock cameo , he arrives at a bus stop during the opening credits but gets there a second too late and the door is closed in his face , he misses the bus. Colorful and glimmer cinematography in Vistavision by Robert Burks , Alfred's ordinary cameraman , showing nice outdoors . Rousing score by Bernard Herrmann , he arranged his whimsical themes from Fandango music. Bernard and Hitch had a long as well as fruitful professional relationship . Rating : 8.5/10 . Essential and indispensable seeing , being perfectly directed by the master himself . Worthwhile watching , one of all-time amusement .

9.0,"""I don't like the way Teddy Roosevelt's looking at me.""","Top entertainment from the Master of Suspense, ""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchs' finest thrillers. Cary Grant, in his final collaboration with Hitch, is aces as a Madison Avenue adman who, by sheer chance, is mistaken as a spy by nefarious types including a debonair James Mason and a creepy Martin Landau. He's also framed for murder, and therefore pursued by the cops, while trying to locate the elusive ""George Kaplan"" who can supposedly help extricate him from the mess. Grant also finds the time to fall in love with a classic elegant blonde Hitchcock leading lady in the form of Eva Marie Saint.Hitch was truly firing on all cylinders here. Assisted by another great score by Bernard Herrmann, his picture begins with typically stylish Saul Bass opening credits. The enticing script is by Ernest Lehman, and for once, it's the kind of scenario where things add up by the time the story finishes. Hitch wastes no time getting the story underway, with a standard little cameo by himself after the opening credits have concluded.Even at two hours and 17 minutes, ""North by Northwest"" never feels as long as it is, due to masterful filmmaking and that twist-laden story. It has the appeal of a scenario wherein an ordinary type of guy ends up way over his head in intrigue. Grant is often scrambling for his life, whether he's pursued by a plane ""crop dusting"", or hanging on by his fingernails from the faces of Mount Rushmore (two very iconic sequences).The cast is wonderful all the way down the line: Mason, Landau, Jessie Royce Landis (playing Grants' mother, despite being just a few years older than him), Leo G. Carroll, Adam Williams, Robert Ellenstein, Edward Platt, Edward Binns, etc. That great English character actor Carroll is a delight as the savvy ""Professor"" who will ultimately have to give Grant some pretty potent exposition. Grant is lots of fun, and Lehman gives him some pretty funny dialogue to savour. Grant also has fine chemistry with Saint, who does come off as aloof at first, but whose stiff-lipped exterior slowly eases.""North by Northwest"" is a tremendous diversion that continues to hold up well, 61 years later. It caps off the great run that Hitch had during the 1950s, with The Master choosing to follow it with one of his most enduring experiments, the legendary ""Psycho"".Nine out of 10.",i dont like way teddy roosevelts looking at me,top entertainment master suspense north by northwest is one hitchs finest thrillers cary grant his final collaboration with hitch is aces as madison avenue adman who by sheer chance is mistaken as spy by nefarious types including debonair james mason creepy martin landau hes also framed murder therefore pursued by cops while trying locate elusive george kaplan who can supposedly help extricate him mess grant also finds time fall love with classic elegant blonde hitchcock leading lady form eva marie saint hitch was truly firing all cylinders here assisted by another great score by bernard herrmann his picture begins with typically stylish saul bass opening credits enticing script is by ernest lehman once its kind scenario where things add up by time story finishes hitch wastes no time getting story underway with standard little cameo by himself after opening credits have concluded even at two hours 17 minutes north by northwest never feels as long as it is due masterful filmmaking that twist laden story it has appeal scenario wherein ordinary type guy ends up way over his head intrigue grant is often scrambling his life whether hes pursued by plane crop dusting or hanging by his fingernails faces mount rushmore two very iconic sequences cast is wonderful all way down line mason landau jessie royce landis playing grants mother despite being just few years older than him leo g carroll adam williams robert ellenstein edward platt edward binns etc that great english character actor carroll is delight as savvy professor who will ultimately have give grant some pretty potent exposition grant is lots fun lehman gives him some pretty funny dialogue savour grant also has fine chemistry with saint who does come off as aloof at first but whose stiff lipped exterior slowly eases north by northwest is tremendous diversion that continues hold up well 61 years later it caps off great run that hitch had during 1950s with master choosing follow it with one his most enduring experiments legendary psycho nine out 10,0.5695767195767195,0.22680933484504914,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.13, 'Sad': 0.07, 'Fear': 0.48}"
10.0,Hitchcock can do action!,"Excellent Alfred Hitchcock film that really is ahead of its time. I say that in several respects which I will allude to.The film from 1959 is about an innocent man (Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill). Thornhill gets mistaken for a U.S. secret agent in a chase across the country that involves scenes of death, amazing action sequences of suspense and the love of an attractive female. I've heard of Cary Grant of course but I admit to never seeing any of his many films. He immediately reminded me of Sir. Roger Moore with his suave demeanour, one liners whilst under pressure and getting the girl.Hitchcock films are of course well known for their technical wizardry. North By Northwest doesn't disappoint in this respect. Simple scenes of cars and the interior of train carriages filmed in the studio look realistic long before CGI ever existed.The film has several dramatic action sequences that wouldn't have looked out of place in a modern spy film. I'm thinking of a chase sequence whilst being followed by an overhead crop duster and scenes in Mount Rushmore. The film has comedic moments intertwined with scenes of murder.Look out for Thornhill acting the fool at an auction. I never expected to be as entertained by such an old film.",hitchcock can do action,excellent alfred hitchcock film that really is ahead its time i say that several respects which i will allude film 1959 is about innocent man cary grant as roger thornhill thornhill gets mistaken u s secret agent chase across country that involves scenes death amazing action sequences suspense love attractive female ive heard cary grant course but i admit never seeing any his many films he immediately reminded me sir roger moore with his suave demeanour one liners whilst under pressure getting girl hitchcock films are course well known their technical wizardry north by northwest doesnt disappoint this respect simple scenes cars interior train carriages filmed studio look realistic long before cgi ever existed film has several dramatic action sequences that wouldnt have looked out place modern spy film im thinking chase sequence whilst being followed by overhead crop duster scenes mount rushmore film has comedic moments intertwined with scenes murder look out thornhill acting fool at auction i never expected be as entertained by such old film,0.3857142857142857,0.1680555555555556,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.24, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.12, 'Fear': 0.36}"
,Hasn't Aged Well,"Hitchcock was likely a genius in his day, and many of his films extraordinary. But at least this one has aged poorly. I was prompted to revisit it because I'm making my own Shakespeare film festival, and the title of this ostensibly comes from Hamlet. He is mad north by northwest as a ruse. There is nothing remotely as sophisticated here.What this film has going for it is Grant's suave composure in adversity, which must have been rare 40 years ago. But this has been played to death in recent decades.What it has against it:--the sets, even the monument are obviously fake junk--the story is unbelieveable. This is normal in film, but in this case there are assumptions about the cold war which even in historic context seem offensive.--there are huge logic holes: for instance the bad guys are spies who on the one hand must hide microfilm in a statue, but at the same time fly their escape plane into one of the most popular national parks!--Eva just isn't that charming, and what's up with her motivation? She's a prostitute that turned good at risk to her life because of patriotism?--If Grant is to be killed, why lure him to a remote location so he can be run down by a biplane? Why does the plane run into the gas truck?--If the spy is so smart, why kidnap Grant and take him to a house illegally borrowed from the head of Intepol? Recall that they knew (or thought they did) that Grant knew who he really was, and they intended to kill him anyway. Why the charade?--Hitchcock was a clever user of the camera, with scenes well framed. But that was in the era of largely stationary cameras. A moving camera was so rare as to have been then a noticable effect. Not so today. Hitchcock's camera is just plain primitive now.--Grant was already an old man. His curvature of the spine is noticeable as well as his stiff gait.--Any tension felt by prior generations was lost on me, and I'm a pretty old guy myself!Lord Edward Bulwar Lytton was highly regarded in his day too. Now, he's a joke, of interest only to historians of the novel. To me, this film is only of historic interest.",hasnt aged well,hitchcock was likely genius his day many his films extraordinary but at least this one has aged poorly i was prompted revisit it because im making my own shakespeare film festival title this ostensibly comes hamlet he is mad north by northwest as ruse there is nothing remotely as sophisticated here what this film has going it is grants suave composure adversity which must have been rare 40 years ago but this has been played death recent decades what it has against it sets even monument are obviously fake junk story is unbelieveable this is normal film but this case there are assumptions about cold war which even historic context seem offensive there are huge logic holes instance bad guys are spies who one hand must hide microfilm statue but at same time fly their escape plane into one most popular national parks eva just isnt that charming whats up with her motivation shes prostitute that turned good at risk her life because patriotism if grant is be killed why lure him remote location so he can be run down by biplane why does plane run into gas truck if spy is so smart why kidnap grant take him house illegally borrowed head intepol recall that they knew or thought they did that grant knew who he really was they intended kill him anyway why charade hitchcock was clever user camera with scenes well framed but that was era largely stationary cameras moving camera was so rare as have been then noticable effect not so today hitchcocks camera is just plain primitive now grant was already old man his curvature spine is noticeable as well as his stiff gait any tension felt by prior generations was lost me im pretty old guy myself lord edward bulwar lytton was highly regarded his day too now hes joke interest only historians novel me this film is only historic interest,0.5926153562200073,0.07161498708010337,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.2, 'Sad': 0.18, 'Fear': 0.33}"
7.0,Good but not quite one of the greatest films of all time,"Considered one of the best of Hitchcock's films I find that I'm not that big a fan of the film. Its not that it's a bad movie, rather I think that the film has been ripped off and re-staged so many times that any power the film might have had is rather dissipated. Its kind of like watching Citizen Kane or some other film that is said to have changed the way movies are done and finding that they don't play all that well. The reason is, like North by Northwest that they changed the rules and have been so copied it hard to see what was so revolutionary about them. As it stands now the story of Cary Grant being mistaken for someone else and having to flee from both the police and the bad guys is exciting, especially in its set pieces, but the rest of it isn't anything special and has the feel of been there and done that especially when compared with Hitchcock's other films. Most certainly worth seeing, just be prepared to wonder what all the shouting is about.",good but not quite one greatest films all time,considered one best hitchcocks films i find that im not that big fan film its not that its bad movie rather i think that film has been ripped off re staged so many times that any power film might have had is rather dissipated its kind like watching citizen kane or some other film that is said have changed way movies are done finding that they dont play all that well reason is like north by northwest that they changed rules have been so copied it hard see what was so revolutionary about them as it stands now story cary grant being mistaken someone else having flee both police bad guys is exciting especially its set pieces but rest it isnt anything special has feel been there done that especially when compared with hitchcocks other films most certainly worth seeing just be prepared wonder what all shouting is about,0.5880252100840336,0.19502801120448182,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.33}"

3.0,absolutely unbelievable,"SPOILER ALERT, please do not read this unless you've seen the movie. Let me assure all you Hitchcock lovers that I also love Hitchcock. Some of my favorite thrillers are Psycho, Rear Window, and Family Plot. I realize you have to ""suspend your disbelief"" to a certain extent. But I found most of the story in North by Northwest absolutely unbelievable. Spoilers follow. I don't understand why the bad guys jumped to the conclusion that Cary Grant was the spy they were after, a spy they'd never even seen. I don't understand why Cary Grant didn't just start yelling and screaming as they abducted him in front of a big crowd of people. I don't understand why the bad guys decided to kill him, not by merely shooting him, but by bothering to force booze down his throat and putting him behind the wheel of a car, or how he was able to drive at all (rather than passing out). I don't understand why the police didn't find out whose house it was (the U.N. diplomat) and then wonder why anyone was there. I don't understand how the blonde knew which train Cary Grant would take, how she knew who he was (so she could pay someone to have him seated at her table in the club car), and why she helped him at all. I don't understand how a large crowd could witness a diplomat being stabbed by someone throwing a knife, then conclude that Cary Grant did it, or why Cary Grant (the ultimate stupidity) would pull the knife out of the diplomat's back and hold it up for everyone to see. Or why, once he was a hunted man, he did absolutely nothing to alter his physical appearance. I don't understand (skipping forward a bit to shorten my review) why the blonde sent Cary Grant to what should've been his certain death, and why, when he survived and saw her again, it didn't even bother him. I don't understand why the bad guys used such an absurdly contrived means of attempting to kill him again, having a crop duster fly at him, instead of (again) just shooting him. I don't understand why the crop duster pilot couldn't avoid flying his plane into a truck. I don't understand why the bad guys were hanging out in an open house that anyone could get into. And I don't understand how Cary Grant and the blonde (or anyone else) could possibly cling to the monuments with nothing but their bare hands and not fall to their deaths. So, with apologies to everyone who ate this up and loved it, I couldn't believe or understand any of these things.",absolutely unbelievable,spoiler alert please do not read this unless youve seen movie let me assure all you hitchcock lovers that i also love hitchcock some my favorite thrillers are psycho rear window family plot i realize you have suspend your disbelief certain extent but i found most story north by northwest absolutely unbelievable spoilers follow i dont understand why bad guys jumped conclusion that cary grant was spy they were after spy theyd never even seen i dont understand why cary grant didnt just start yelling screaming as they abducted him front big crowd people i dont understand why bad guys decided kill him not by merely shooting him but by bothering force booze down his throat putting him behind wheel car or how he was able drive at all rather than passing out i dont understand why police didnt find out whose house it was u n diplomat then wonder why anyone was there i dont understand how blonde knew which train cary grant would take how she knew who he was so she could pay someone have him seated at her table club car why she helped him at all i dont understand how large crowd could witness diplomat being stabbed by someone throwing knife then conclude that cary grant did it or why cary grant ultimate stupidity would pull knife out diplomats back hold it up everyone see or why once he was hunted man he did absolutely nothing alter his physical appearance i dont understand skipping forward bit shorten my review why blonde sent cary grant what shouldve been his certain death why when he survived saw her again it didnt even bother him i dont understand why bad guys used such absurdly contrived means attempting kill him again having crop duster fly at him instead again just shooting him i dont understand why crop duster pilot couldnt avoid flying his plane into truck i dont understand why bad guys were hanging out open house that anyone could get into i dont understand how cary grant blonde or anyone else could possibly cling monuments with nothing but their bare hands not fall their deaths so with apologies everyone who ate this up loved it i couldnt believe or understand any these things,0.5670262896825398,-0.033209325396825376,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.45}"
