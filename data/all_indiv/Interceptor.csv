2,Almost unwatchable,"This is one of those rare moments when you should trust the negative reviews. Elsa Pataky was fine in the small roles she had in the Fast and Furious films but she is not an action star and her acting can not support a film on its own. Apart from that the cgi in this is TERRIBLE, it looks like you are watching a direct to video film from the 80s. The writing is awful, the one liners in this are so generic and completely uninspired. The action in this is also very bland and the fight scenes are too repetitive. Nothing about this movie is fresh or entertaining, I'm not sure who the target audience is supposed to be but this is one movie that you should avoid.",almost unwatchable,this is one those rare moments when you should trust negative reviews elsa pataky was fine small roles she had fast furious films but she is not action star her acting can not support film its own apart that cgi this is terrible it looks like you are watching direct video film 80s writing is awful one liners this are so generic completely uninspired action this is also very bland fight scenes are too repetitive nothing about this movie is fresh or entertaining im not sure who target audience is supposed be but this is one movie that you should avoid,0.5652046783625732,-0.06842105263157895,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.07, 'Angry': 0.07, 'Surprise': 0.07, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.6}"
