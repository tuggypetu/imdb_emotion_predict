5.0,Watching a crime scene,"Human Centipede 2 is like watching a crime scene. Besides our nasty, degenerate villain in Martin, there is no character development at all. What is on the screen is just violent act after violent act, culminating in a slightly open ending. I was expecting to see some really horrible acts of violence against bodies, and that's exactly what I got. I didn't enjoy it one bit. However, I cannot deny the effect it had upon me. I had to watch the Simpsons for an hour following this film so I could feel normal again. Physically, this is the most disturbing film I've seen. I have seen worse in extreme cinema when you are actually invested in the characters, but that is impossible here. This movie is not for the squeamish at all, in fact a scene or two forced me to turn away and gag slightly. It sucks to admit that as I consider myself a seasoned genre fan, but yeah, certain parts were really freaking gross. Was there any tension? Well the first one elicited a few genuine scares but here, the fear is for what your eyes are going to be subjected to next.

6.0,Martin has a dream ... that one day ... the world will be a giant human centipede!,"Actually I should be grateful to Tom Six Thanks to him and his demented movie, I finally know where to draw my own personal line when it comes to tolerating cinematic smut! The ideal way to describe this movie is to simply write down as many synonyms for the word ""repulsive"" you can think of! So here goes: ""The Human Centipede II: Full sequence"" is revolting, sickening, disgusting, loathsome, degrading, nauseating, appalling, despicable, vile, heinous, nefarious and absolutely positively depraved! The first film already caused quite a bit of commotion and controversy because of its plot and a handful of shocking sequences, but I swear the original looks like a politically correct Disney family flick compared to the totally messed up sequel! Not only does the concept of creating a human centipede gets enlarged and illustrated a lot more graphically, also the characters and sub plots are much more perverted and insane than in ""First Sequence"". I realize this will sound as a recommendation to all the sick puppies amongst you, but this is truly one of the most repugnant movies ever made. In spite of the emphasis more than obviously lying on gore and shock-factor, I nevertheless have to admit that the film features a number of ingenious story lines and creative twists. The whole basic plot and set up, for example, is surprisingly inventive. The sequel considers the original film in fact as a purely fictional ""film"" and thus the events and unorthodox medical experiments of Dr. Heiter were never real. However, the protagonist of part two – the obese and mentally handicapped midget named Martin – is addicted to watching this crazy movie and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating his very own (and bigger) human centipede. I can't deny that I find this idea intriguing as a starting point for a sequel. Writer/director Tom Six also generates a suitably grim and disturbing surrounding around pivot character Martin. He lives with his mother but she hates Martin with a passion. Why? Because her husband is in prison as Martin couldn't keep his pedophilic nightly visits secret. Martin works as a concierge in an underground parking lot where he captures his victims, but also bashes people's heads in with a crowbar and masturbates using sandpaper! He brings his centipede victims - all 12 of them, including a very pregnant woman – to a raunchy hangar and accomplishes his dream, which leads to many gross tableaux, I assure you. Multiple images that I can't even begin to describe truly give a whole new meaning to the words tasteless and immoral. When approaching the grand finale, you may expect scenes featuring excrement, rape, miscarriage and gratuitous torture/mutilation. Don't even consider watching ""The Human Centipede II"" – not even out of curiosity – if you have a bit of virtue left inside yourself. Laurence R. Harvey gives away a peculiar and remarkable performance as Martin. He is so convincingly perverted and deviant that I sincerely doubt if he's even a normal person in real life... I don't want to know him at least, that's for sure. The film is entirely shot in black and white, which perhaps makes the gruesomeness and on screen filth slightly more digestible, but primarily it increases the sober and grim atmosphere of it all. Other elements that contribute to this are the minimal use of dialogs and/or soundtrack and the nihilistic narrative tone. It maybe feels weird to admit, but technically speaking ""The Human Centipede II"" is actually a competent effort. Apparently there's already a third installment in the making, but I might just spare myself the hideous aftertaste in my mouth and stomach.",martin has dream that one day world will be giant human centipede,actually i should be grateful tom six thanks him his demented movie i finally know where draw my own personal line when it comes tolerating cinematic smut ideal way describe this movie is simply write down as many synonyms word repulsive you can think so here goes human centipede ii full sequence is revolting sickening disgusting loathsome degrading nauseating appalling despicable vile heinous nefarious absolutely positively depraved first film already caused quite bit commotion controversy because its plot handful shocking sequences but i swear original looks like politically correct disney family flick compared totally messed up sequel not only does concept creating human centipede gets enlarged illustrated lot more graphically also characters sub plots are much more perverted insane than first sequence i realize this will sound as recommendation all sick puppies amongst you but this is truly one most repugnant movies ever made spite emphasis more than obviously lying gore shock factor i nevertheless have admit that film features number ingenious story lines creative twists whole basic plot set up example is surprisingly inventive sequel considers original film fact as purely fictional film thus events unorthodox medical experiments dr heiter were never real however protagonist part two obese mentally handicapped midget named martin is addicted watching this crazy movie becomes obsessed with idea creating his very own bigger human centipede i cant deny that i find this idea intriguing as starting point sequel writer director tom six also generates suitably grim disturbing surrounding around pivot character martin he lives with his mother but she hates martin with passion why because her husband is prison as martin couldnt keep his pedophilic nightly visits secret martin works as concierge underground parking lot where he captures his victims but also bashes peoples heads with crowbar masturbates using sandpaper he brings his centipede victims all 12 them including very pregnant woman raunchy hangar accomplishes his dream which leads many gross tableaux i assure you multiple images that i cant even begin describe truly give whole new meaning words tasteless immoral when approaching grand finale you may expect scenes featuring excrement rape miscarriage gratuitous torture mutilation dont even consider watching human centipede ii not even out curiosity if you have bit virtue left inside yourself laurence r harvey gives away peculiar remarkable performance as martin he is so convincingly perverted deviant that i sincerely doubt if hes even normal person real life i dont want know him at least thats sure film is entirely shot black white which perhaps makes gruesomeness screen filth slightly more digestible but primarily it increases sober grim atmosphere it all other elements that contribute this are minimal use dialogs or soundtrack nihilistic narrative tone it maybe feels weird admit but technically speaking human centipede ii is actually competent effort apparently theres already third installment making but i might just spare myself hideous aftertaste my mouth stomach,0.5351895943562609,0.029060686227352896,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.12, 'Surprise': 0.22, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.36}"
1.0,Why Do They Make Movies Like This?,"I detested ""The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),"" and yet I'm well aware that it was made with me in mind – me and anyone else who thought that last year's ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"" was a disgusting, pointless, morally bankrupt pile of garbage. Writer/director Tom Six made a promise as he was promoting the original film, namely that the sequel would ""go full force in graphic details, making part 1 look like My Little Pony""; by living up to that promise in spades, he has given his harshest critics the cinematic equivalent of the one-fingered salute. If you're reading this, Mr. Six, let me be the first to congratulate you on telling me off with such incredible flair. Let me also reassure you that you're absolutely right about people like me. We're not persuaded by the ""artistry"" or ""entertainment value"" of torture porn.I've just been made aware that Six is currently working on a third chapter, which, according to an interview with Empire.com, he promises will ""make the last one look like a Disney film."" That's a pretty tall order considering the imagery he subjects us to in this film, including (but not limited to) a man masturbating with sandpaper, people defecating into other people's mouths, and the head of a just-born fetus being crushed under the gas pedal of a car. Incidentally, are these supposed to be symbolic of something? I'm asking this because I tend to overlook symbolism when I'm actively trying to keep myself from vomiting in sheer revulsion. Earlier this year, when I had to endure the wretched ""A Serbian Film,"" a reader happily explained to me the meaning behind a newborn baby being raped, which, I admit, went completely over my head. I expect that same person will tell me how I've failed to see the genius in ""The Human Centipede 2.""What a sick, depraved, repugnant movie this is. Why do producers, writers, and directors believe such films need to be made? How is it that they actually gain a following? I'm greatly disturbed by the fact that there's a demand for them. We don't need movies like this in our lives, not even for the purposes of entertainment – which is a funny word to use, because it's inconceivable to me how anyone could possibly find this kind of trash entertaining. If stories like this appeal to you, if you get some kind of dizzy thrill at the sight of degrading, pointless exploitation, you inhabit a world I officially want no part of. There are enough screwed up people in the world without their sadistic perversions being gleefully celebrated in a movie theater.The film is not a sequel in the strictest sense. Six adopts a metafictional approach, telling the story of a British security guard obsessed with the first ""Human Centipede"" film. His name is Martin (Laurence R. Harvey). He's short, overweight, asthmatic, and by all accounts, mentally ill. Apart from some groans and a good deal of maniacal laughter, he says not a single word throughout the entire film. He lives with his mother (Vivien Bridson), who verbally berates him at every available opportunity. She blames him for putting her husband in prison, apparently in denial or completely unmindful of the fact that he sexually abused Martin on a regular basis. A psychologist (Bill Hutchens) has frequent sessions with Martin in his living room. Are we supposed to find it funny that this doctor is a pervert who lusts after Martin?When he's not at home, he's either brooding in his parking garage toll booth or targeting victims. You see, he wants make his own human centipede, only he wants to outdo the Dr. Heiter character and increase the chain from three people to twelve. And so he beats unsuspecting people senseless with a crowbar (how they survive this is anyone's guess), piles them in a van, drives them to a secluded (and conveniently abandoned) warehouse, and leaves them to lie naked in filth and darkness. He lures in Ashlynn Yennie, who played Jenny in ""The Human Centipede,"" by pretending to be Quentin Tarantino's casting agent. We eventually have to endure Martin surgically joining his victims mouth to anus, which in this case involves such needlessly graphic imagery as knives slicing through flesh and vital parts being attached with a staple gun. We then have to bear witness to an ambiguous ending that cheats.Six's cinematographer, David Meadows, photographs all this in black and white, arguably in the least artistic way possible. Did anyone making this movie honestly believe that, by employing a cinematic device as dreamlike as black and white, the material would somehow be elevated? No amount of technique would have made this movie work. Like the film that preceded it, it shouldn't have been made at all. ""The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)"" is not only one of the year's worst films, nor is it merely one of the worst movies ever made; it represents all that we as human beings should strive to evolve against. Under no circumstances should we be amused by cruelty, suffering, and exploitation. The sooner we realize this, the sooner we can make that next step.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",why do they make movies like this,i detested human centipede 2 full sequence yet im well aware that it was made with me mind me anyone else who thought that last years human centipede first sequence was disgusting pointless morally bankrupt pile garbage writer director tom six made promise as he was promoting original film namely that sequel would go full force graphic details making part 1 look like my little pony by living up that promise spades he has given his harshest critics cinematic equivalent one fingered salute if youre reading this mr six let me be first congratulate you telling me off with such incredible flair let me also reassure you that youre absolutely right about people like me were not persuaded by artistry or entertainment value torture porn ive just been made aware that six is currently working third chapter which according interview with empire com he promises will make last one look like disney film thats pretty tall order considering imagery he subjects us this film including but not limited man masturbating with sandpaper people defecating into other peoples mouths head just born fetus being crushed under gas pedal car incidentally are these supposed be symbolic something im asking this because i tend overlook symbolism when im actively trying keep myself vomiting sheer revulsion earlier this year when i had endure wretched serbian film reader happily explained me meaning behind newborn baby being raped which i admit went completely over my head i expect that same person will tell me how ive failed see genius human centipede 2 what sick depraved repugnant movie this is why do producers writers directors believe such films need be made how is it that they actually gain following im greatly disturbed by fact that theres demand them we dont need movies like this our lives not even purposes entertainment which is funny word use because its inconceivable me how anyone could possibly find this kind trash entertaining if stories like this appeal you if you get some kind dizzy thrill at sight degrading pointless exploitation you inhabit world i officially want no part there are enough screwed up people world without their sadistic perversions being gleefully celebrated movie theater film is not sequel strictest sense six adopts metafictional approach telling story british security guard obsessed with first human centipede film his name is martin laurence r harvey hes short overweight asthmatic by all accounts mentally ill apart some groans good deal maniacal laughter he says not single word throughout entire film he lives with his mother vivien bridson who verbally berates him at every available opportunity she blames him putting her husband prison apparently denial or completely unmindful fact that he sexually abused martin regular basis psychologist bill hutchens has frequent sessions with martin his living room are we supposed find it funny that this doctor is pervert who lusts after martin when hes not at home hes either brooding his parking garage toll booth or targeting victims you see he wants make his own human centipede only he wants outdo dr heiter character increase chain three people twelve so he beats unsuspecting people senseless with crowbar how they survive this is anyones guess piles them van drives them secluded conveniently abandoned warehouse leaves them lie naked filth darkness he lures ashlynn yennie who played jenny human centipede by pretending be quentin tarantinos casting agent we eventually have endure martin surgically joining his victims mouth anus which this case involves such needlessly graphic imagery as knives slicing through flesh vital parts being attached with staple gun we then have bear witness ambiguous ending that cheats sixs cinematographer david meadows photographs all this black white arguably least artistic way possible did anyone making this movie honestly believe that by employing cinematic device as dreamlike as black white material would somehow be elevated no amount technique would have made this movie work like film that preceded it it shouldnt have been made at all human centipede 2 full sequence is not only one years worst films nor is it merely one worst movies ever made it represents all that we as human beings should strive evolve against under no circumstances should we be amused by cruelty suffering exploitation sooner we realize this sooner we can make that next step chris pandolfi www atatheaternearyou net,0.47212235228539573,0.049152432712215297,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.18, 'Sad': 0.35, 'Fear': 0.32}"

1.0,"Sick, disturbing & unsettling.","First of all, I think Tom Six, the director of this film is apparently not a mentally well individual and probably needs help. Please don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a good horror movie. Devil's Rejects, A Serbian Film, Saw, Hostel, etc. Those kind of movies are a cakewalk (except maybe 'A Serbian Film') compared to this. As hard as I try, I can't even think of a film to compare this to. I have seen the first Human Centipede and was appalled. When Human Centipede 2 came out, I suppose I was curious and wanted to see how Tom could utilize feces for his next 'masterpiece'. This is a film has very little plot. It is all about feces. Do we really need a movie with feces involved? I know people have fetishes, and Tom Six seems to have a feces fetish (which is fine, I suppose), but why share it with the world? Sure, I could sit here and bash the director, Tom Six, but after researching his background, he seems to get a thrill over peoples reaction to this kind of subject matter, and he isn't afraid to say so. This also confirms his his need of therapy or confinement to a mental institution. If you enjoy watching people forced to consume feces, this film may be right up your alley.So I ask myself...... Who would finance this kind of vile? What kind of company would distribute this? Who would pull out their checkbook and pay for movie props, actors, camera equipment and rent movie locations for this kind of film? Who is in charge of making the fake fecal matter in the film? That must be a rewarding job. What kind of actor would look at this script and say ""Oh yes - I really wan't to be a star in this movie.""? How can you look at yourself in the mirror after being an actor/actress in this movie? I have more respect for actors in porno movies. Think carefully before watching this movie.

5.0,Surprisingly it works.,"What this singular piece of nastiness has going for it in the main is brevity, no film of 88 minutes really ever outstays its welcome. Tom Six feels like a guy who knows what buttons to push, he introduces a minor character who is a kind of cartoon of the UK doctor / serial killer Harold Shipman, whose educated, imperturbable, casually degraded outlook is like acid in your face. There's also an incredibly disturbing line that evokes the main character's messed up childhood, ""Crying will only make daddy's willy harder"".Martin is an obese middle-aged nighttime security guard, who lives with his mother, who blames him for having his father sent to jail (i.e. being there for him to abuse). He is fantastically ugly, a stigma which in Western society leads to ostracisation. Martin is looking at these cards he's been dealt, which ain't great, and decides it's time for the proverbial to hit the fan, which is to say he'd like to try and re-enact his favourite DVD, The Human Centipede.The British censors (and no doubt those of other countries will follow suit), have spared us a scene of a mother brutally killing her own newborn by mistake, of a coil of barbed wire being used as a marital aid, and like their forebears, the censors of Witchfinder General, had to ponder on just how many bludgeons with an axe, or in this case teeth removed by hammer blow, are acceptable, and decided on a lower number than the director.The film is not quite squared away in terms of plot plausibility, but does what it can.I actually found the movie implausibly human, what Martin ends up doing seems, on the face of it, entirely logical (which is not to say that everyone who is abused becomes an abuser). The film seems to have a message that people are marginalised and forgotten about at our peril, that society is judged by the people who behave the worst.Two of Six's gambles that pay off extremely well are shooting the movie in black and white, and having Martin remain dialogue-less throughout. His implacability and remorselessness say all that needs to be said about someone who has been kept as an animal and poked one too many times. The black and white shooting literally portrays a miserable world drained of any colour.",surprisingly it works,what this singular piece nastiness has going it main is brevity no film 88 minutes really ever outstays its welcome tom six feels like guy who knows what buttons push he introduces minor character who is kind cartoon uk doctor serial killer harold shipman whose educated imperturbable casually degraded outlook is like acid your face theres also incredibly disturbing line that evokes main characters messed up childhood crying will only make daddys willy harder martin is obese middle aged nighttime security guard who lives with his mother who blames him having his father sent jail i e being there him abuse he is fantastically ugly stigma which western society leads ostracisation martin is looking at these cards hes been dealt which aint great decides its time proverbial hit fan which is say hed like try re enact his favourite dvd human centipede british censors no doubt those other countries will follow suit have spared us scene mother brutally killing her own newborn by mistake coil barbed wire being used as marital aid like their forebears censors witchfinder general had ponder just how many bludgeons with axe or this case teeth removed by hammer blow are acceptable decided lower number than director film is not quite squared away terms plot plausibility but does what it can i actually found movie implausibly human what martin ends up doing seems face it entirely logical which is not say that everyone who is abused becomes abuser film seems have message that people are marginalised forgotten about at our peril that society is judged by people who behave worst two sixs gambles that pay off extremely well are shooting movie black white having martin remain dialogue less throughout his implacability remorselessness say all that needs be said about someone who has been kept as animal poked one too many times black white shooting literally portrays miserable world drained any colour,0.4632882882882883,-0.014639639639639644,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.09, 'Angry': 0.11, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.11, 'Fear': 0.47}"
1.0,Strips Away the Twisted Charm of the Original,"In my review of the first, umm, segment of Tom Six's ""Human Centipede"" series, I stated that it was a very difficult film to review as it's inherently meant to alienate and disgust – so how to judge it evenly? I had no such problem with The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) as not only does it retain (and amplify) the revoltingness of the original, but strips away any twisted charm, tension, good performances and frequent tongue-in-cheek execution that made ""First Sequence"" better than it had any right to be.Many haphazardly brand films they dislike as ""worthless,"" but some movies are genuinely without any merit. ""Full Sequence"" is such a rarity. This sequel is artless, humorless, boring, without style (well, it is in black and white, so it must be high-class), purpose, or cleverness, and is generally off-putting, but never haunting or lasting. The only purpose seems to be in Tom Six's mind, in that he wanted to one-up himself. He succeeded in scope, but failed in every other aspect.The opening scene reveals to us that the entire first movie was just that: a cinematic endeavour. Cut to Martin, a lonely and infinitely unhinged parking lot attendant who becomes obsessed with the film and further obsesses over creating his own humanoid monstrosity with twelve victims – an addition of nine. You see, these unlucky folks will be surgically attached mouth to anus, thereby connecting the gastric system, giving birth to a human centipede. His plan involves shooting his targets in the leg, bludgeoning them with a crowbar, tossing them into the back of his van and driving them to a grungy warehouse to await their fate. This drawn-out portion of the movie slogs along as Martin collects his subjects in a rythmic, monotonous pace with no sense of impending dread or sympathy for his victims. The camera seemingly just rolls for the hell of it.While the original benefited from a deliciously deranged performance from Dieter Laser as the mad doctor, Laurence B. Harvey's Martin never speaks, is grotesque in his appearance and mannerisms and has no interesting motives or backstory except that he was apparently sexually abused by his father. In fact the entire second half of the film contains no dialogue, as by this point all the characters' mouths are otherwise full (I apologize for that imagery). When the poop did flow, I was both bored and otherwise desensitized from the previous grotesque events and simply wanted the experience to end. A backhanded aim of Six may have been to craft a movie that nobody could sit through, and he did succeed, but not in the way he likely intended. I felt my time was being wasted, not that I was being shocked to new extremes.The only people I could recommend this movie to would be those like myself who enjoyed the first and are curious about the follow-up, but I would have to tack on the disclaimer that they will be disappointed and viewing could even diminish the bizarre appeal of the first. But I suppose if you truly love fecal matter, back-room surgery, blood, torture, infanticide, profanity, child abuse and (of course) centipedes, you will be in cinematic bliss. Six already plans to finish his vision with a third movie entitled Human Centipede (Final Sequence) and after fulfilling the worries I had that he would one-up himself to a fault with this movie, I quiver at the load of dung he has in store for us to cap the trilogy.Read my review of the original: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/reviews-40",strips away twisted charm original,my review first umm segment tom sixs human centipede series i stated that it was very difficult film review as its inherently meant alienate disgust so how judge it evenly i had no such problem with human centipede ii full sequence as not only does it retain amplify revoltingness original but strips away any twisted charm tension good performances frequent tongue cheek execution that made first sequence better than it had any right be many haphazardly brand films they dislike as worthless but some movies are genuinely without any merit full sequence is such rarity this sequel is artless humorless boring without style well it is black white so it must be high class purpose or cleverness is generally off putting but never haunting or lasting only purpose seems be tom sixs mind that he wanted one up himself he succeeded scope but failed every other aspect opening scene reveals us that entire first movie was just that cinematic endeavour cut martin lonely infinitely unhinged parking lot attendant who becomes obsessed with film further obsesses over creating his own humanoid monstrosity with twelve victims addition nine you see these unlucky folks will be surgically attached mouth anus thereby connecting gastric system giving birth human centipede his plan involves shooting his targets leg bludgeoning them with crowbar tossing them into back his van driving them grungy warehouse await their fate this drawn out portion movie slogs along as martin collects his subjects rythmic monotonous pace with no sense impending dread or sympathy his victims camera seemingly just rolls hell it while original benefited deliciously deranged performance dieter laser as mad doctor laurence b harveys martin never speaks is grotesque his appearance mannerisms has no interesting motives or backstory except that he was apparently sexually abused by his father fact entire second half film contains no dialogue as by this point all characters mouths are otherwise full i apologize that imagery when poop did flow i was both bored otherwise desensitized previous grotesque events simply wanted experience end backhanded aim six may have been craft movie that nobody could sit through he did succeed but not way he likely intended i felt my time was being wasted not that i was being shocked new extremes only people i could recommend this movie would be those like myself who enjoyed first are curious about follow up but i would have tack disclaimer that they will be disappointed viewing could even diminish bizarre appeal first but i suppose if you truly love fecal matter back room surgery blood torture infanticide profanity child abuse course centipedes you will be cinematic bliss six already plans finish his vision with third movie entitled human centipede final sequence after fulfilling worries i had that he would one up himself fault with this movie i quiver at load dung he has store us cap trilogy read my review original,0.5572475241653325,0.004549012631204412,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.19, 'Sad': 0.29, 'Fear': 0.38}"
7.0,Vast improvement over the first film is down right unnerving at times,"Vile disgusting and just plain wrong sequel to one of the stupidest films ever made is a brilliant reinvention of the premise.The film has a worm like attendant in a parking garage who love Human Centipede deciding to make his own version for real and simply kidnapping and killing people in order to do so.Its a minimalist plot that shouldn't work but does thanks to great photography, a creepy lead character and several set pieces that are just unpleasantly wrong.This film is wrong on so many levels it somehow pulls enough of itself together to actually become an endurance test that is almost worth subjecting yourself to. Far worse than you can imagine, thanks to the black and white photography this is almost as unpleasant a film as I've seen in a while.Honestly the film works best in the set pieces, the various murders, and even the final climatic sequence just get under your skin with there own dreamlike logic.

,How disgusting can a movie be?,"If you've ever wondered, ""how disgusting can a movie be?..."" well, this film pretty much answers the question. For what it is - and you probably know more or less what it is, or you wouldn't be reading this - it is fully realized in pretty much every aspect. Casting Harvey was pure genius. He carries the film with his amazing performance. There are plenty of little twists to keep you occupied, some of which are actually humorous in a grotesque way. The odd thing, though, is that the film really isn't scary. Maybe because Martin is so divorced from reality that he seems incapable of true evil. Rather, he is just driven by a single-minded vision to complete his project. Probably the first real success he's had in his sad, sad life. The effects are spot-on, and the pacing generally good, although I found it dragged a bit about 2/3 of the way through. However, the brashness and oddness of this film have surely earned it a spot alongside cult classics such as Eraserhead.",how disgusting can movie be,if youve ever wondered how disgusting can movie be well this film pretty much answers question what it is you probably know more or less what it is or you wouldnt be reading this it is fully realized pretty much every aspect casting harvey was pure genius he carries film with his amazing performance there are plenty little twists keep you occupied some which are actually humorous grotesque way odd thing though is that film really isnt scary maybe because martin is so divorced reality that he seems incapable true evil rather he is just driven by single minded vision complete his project probably first real success hes had his sad sad life effects are spot pacing generally good although i found it dragged bit about 2 3 way through however brashness oddness this film have surely earned it spot alongside cult classics such as eraserhead,0.6260435038212816,-0.013999118165784832,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.35, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.26}"

The first movie at least a semblance of a plot but this crude and nasty ""movie"" has no plot-it's nothing short of torture porn. The first 30 minutes or so passable but the last third was just revolting. There is no motive other than to show people suffering and being mutilated. I couldn't even watch most of it.

As an actor, there i no amount of money or notoriety that would convince me to do something so horrendous. It's just sick for the sake of being sick. It doesn't even make sense. Martin works in a parking garage to find victims yet no one ever notices his actions or him coming to work covered in blood. Sick, vile and disgusting.

7.0,Absolutely Amazing Sequel,"Inspired by the fictional Dr. Heiter, disturbed loner Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) dreams of creating a 12-person centipede and sets out to realize his sick fantasy.I loved this movie, and I think it is probably receiving lower ratings than it should because it will not appeal to wide audiences. First of all, you obviously have to be a fan of the first film, so that narrows down the audience for this one. And then, you have to appreciate the fact this is a fictional story referencing a fictional story.Finally, I think you have to grasp that this is a very dark comedy -- possibly the darkest comedy ever made. Is it a horror film? Absolutely. It contains one of the most terrifying scenarios possible. But it is clear from certain elements (such as the brown splat on the screen and the psychiatrist) that there is a dark, twisted humor here, too.Laurence Harvey is incredible, and plays the part of Martin flawlessly. You might even feel sorry for him, or have a certain sense of compassion. Is he sick? Yes. But he fully cognizant of what he is doing? It would appear not.Recommended for fans of the first film.

6.0,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),"It's not often that you get the original film featured as part of the sequel, i.e. the film within the sequel to the film, but this is what happened with this one to the very controversial original, and I heard that this one was much worse (taste wise), it sounded worth watching, from director Tom Six, who apparently worked on the Dutch version of Big Brother, where it first began. Basically Martin Lomax (Laurence R. Harvey) is a mentally disturbed lonely weirdo who lives with his Mother (Vivien Bridson), he loves and is obsessed by the cult horror film The Human Centipede (First Sequence). Martin works as a security guard during the night shift in a grim underground parking complex, to escape his dreary and almost worthless existence he watches the film with delight, he even masturbates to it, and also has his own pet centipede. Martin fetishes to have the same surgical skill as the film's leading antagonist Dr. Josef Heiter (Dieter Laser), with his knowledge for the human gastrointestinal system, of course Martin has no surgical knowledge whatsoever. But his obsession for the film has become increasingly extreme, to the point where he dreams of making his own Human Centipede, but not with three people like what he has seen, but with more. Martin's mother sees this obsession, in anger she rips up his scrapbook full of photos and articles about the film, in retaliation Martin smashes her skull in until dead, he puts the corpse in a chair and props it up at the dinner table. So Martin starts finding and kidnapping random people to start the process of his sick dream, stripping them all of their clothing, tying them up and gagging them with duct tape, he hopes to create ""the full sequence"" of twelve people. Martin even manages to get his hands on one of the actors who became part of the film Centipede, the leading actress Ashlynn Yennie, after pretending to be Quentin Tarantino's casting agent, she is to become his head of his creation. In an abandoned warehouse, Martin begins his building of his own Human Centipede, but instead of using surgical tools and medical expertise, he is having to rely on more duct tape, dodgy DIY tool skills and hideous mutilation, like knocking teeth out with a hammer. One of the twelve victims dies in agony, and the other, a pregnant woman, seems to be dead but is actually unconscious, so Martin has to settle with ten people taped together with their mouths stapled to the previous person's anus, and the leg tendons cut to stop them getting away. Of course part of the process of having the victims connected is having the head eat, passing excrement through from person to person, but to speed this process he gives each victim a sip of laxative, causing them each to have their bowels explode. After seeing a victim or two die from choking on excrement or their own vomit, the pregnant woman wakes up and runs out of the warehouse to the nearest car, in the process of escaping she gives birth to her child, but it dies when she crushes it's skull, she drives away. Martin is extremely angry, and the Human Centipede have managed to split in half, but the psychopath takes a gun and shoots each victim in the head, until Miss Yennie is the last left alive. But she manages to grab hold of the funnel Martin used to force feed her, she shoves it up his anus and throws his pet centipede down it, and he is screaming in agony. The film ends however with Martin waking up while watching his favourite film, leaving you to question whether the events seen were real, just his imagination, or him dreaming. Also starring Bill Hutchens as Dr. Sebring, Maddi Black as Candy, Kandace Caine as Karrie, Dominic Borrelli as Paul, Lucas Hansen as Ian, Lee Nicholas Harris as Dick, Dan Burman as Greg, Daniel Jude Gennis as Tim, Georgia Goodrick as Valerie, Emma Lock as Kim, Katherine Templar as Rachel and Peter Blankenstein as Alan. Harvey gives a most exceptional performance as the non- speaking obese severely disgusting character with the sick fantasy to create something he has seen in his treasured film, it almost mirrors concerns parents have about life imitating fiction. This sequel is certainly much more violent than the first film, so much so that it was banned entirely by the BBFC (British Board of Film Classifiction), who refused to touch it, as it was ""revolting"", but eventually it was released as an 18 certificate with thirty two compulsory cuts totalling two minutes and thirty seven seconds. From what I have read, this material is very extreme and was right to be taken out, including Martin masturbating with sandpaper around his penis, and Martin with barbed wire wrapped around his penis violently raping a woman, you could almost tell where these moments were meant to happen, from what was left in, it is still a highly violent, and a most interesting to watch horror.

2.0,As bad as the fecal matter he forces his victims to excrete,"I had somewhat high hopes for this movie. Not for it to be the sickfest that Tom Six promised in the early teaser trailer, but for Tom Six to actually create something lasting with the infamy he gained through the previous film. The Human Centipede itself wasn't all that bad I thought personally. Twisted sure, outlandish definitely. However, aside from the poor show of acting from the American student girls early on in the film, the standard of acting was good. The plot was linear, shocking, and kept you gripped to your seat, or the toilet bowl for as long as the movie was running. The film itself also came in under the radar. My friend came home once and said he had just watched a movie called 'The Human Centipede.' He then asked me to imagine what comes to mind when I think of those words. Of course I was way off, but by this point I just had to watch it out of intrigue alone.The second film is none of the above. Indeed, it is sick, twisted, and outlandish; and then some. But it just isn't original, clever, or even remotely logical. I don't want to go into the plot and explain who does what, aside to say that there is no real protagonist, and pretty much everybody in the film is either an antagonist, or deserves to die. There is a moment where you think that one woman will come through as some sort of hero, but then she does the most insane thing I have ever seen in a film. You'll know it when you see it: if you see the uncut version. Tom Six is taking his audience for a ride, and not a good one. He's laughing at the people paying the ticket price and stupid they were to trust him and his film making ability. The majority of the movie is shot entirely in black and white except for one part of the movie that has touchings of brown, in a similar fashion to the way blood is portrayed in Frank Millar's Sin City: have a quick guess which part that is. Note: that same scene that lasted a minute in the original lasts for ten whole minutes in this laughable sequel. I said to my housemate after the credits rolled that watching this movie was like eating an insanely hot curry, or camping out at a festival; neither are particularly enjoyable by the end, but at least you can tell all of your friends you did it.",as bad as fecal matter he forces his victims excrete,i had somewhat high hopes this movie not it be sickfest that tom six promised early teaser trailer but tom six actually create something lasting with infamy he gained through previous film human centipede itself wasnt all that bad i thought personally twisted sure outlandish definitely however aside poor show acting american student girls early film standard acting was good plot was linear shocking kept you gripped your seat or toilet bowl as long as movie was running film itself also came under radar my friend came home once said he had just watched movie called human centipede he then asked me imagine what comes mind when i think those words course i was way off but by this point i just had watch it out intrigue alone second film is none above indeed it is sick twisted outlandish then some but it just isnt original clever or even remotely logical i dont want go into plot explain who does what aside say that there is no real protagonist pretty much everybody film is either antagonist or deserves die there is moment where you think that one woman will come through as some sort hero but then she does most insane thing i have ever seen film youll know it when you see it if you see uncut version tom six is taking his audience ride not good one hes laughing at people paying ticket price stupid they were trust him his film making ability majority movie is shot entirely black white except one part movie that has touchings brown similar fashion way blood is portrayed frank millars sin city have quick guess which part that is note that same scene that lasted minute original lasts ten whole minutes this laughable sequel i said my housemate after credits rolled that watching this movie was like eating insanely hot curry or camping out at festival neither are particularly enjoyable by end but at least you can tell all your friends you did it,0.4607693553611921,-0.07185617103984451,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.08, 'Angry': 0.03, 'Surprise': 0.4, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.26}"
,"Unlike the Original, This One Lives Up to the Hype","Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), The (2011)*** (out of 4) Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), a deranged man who was sexually abused by his father, lives his life with his abusive mother who blames him for the father being in prison. Martin, a fan of the film THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE, finally reaches his breaking point and begins to pick victims so that he can create his own 12-person centipede. When THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE was released in 2009 it hit with a storm of controversy and it appeared that the film gained a cult following even before it was released. I found the movie to be well-made but found most of the so-called ""shock value"" to just be hype. I thought the film wasn't nearly as graphic as the filmmakers would like you to believe and the word around the campfire started to build early for this sequel. All sorts of rumors were leaked onto the net about how shocking this film was going to be so does it succeed or was it just more hype? I'd have to say a little bit of both but there's no question that this here is a much better movie than the first. With that said, if you're offended by the subject matter or graphic violence then there's no purpose to see this thing as no matter how well-made it is you're not going to make it through. The first portion of the film is going to remind people of ERASERHEAD as we spend most of the time getting to know this Martin character. On one hand you can't help but feel sorry for the guy due to him being raped by his father and abused by everyone in his life but then again you really can't forgive anything he's going to do on his quest. I really thought the first hour of the movie did a great job at building a sick atmosphere and a very surreal one without having to use any gore or violence. I think the sickening atmosphere created was exceptionally strong and it's do to the visual style and the performance by Harvey. Harvey doesn't get any dialogue so he's just acting his gestures, his eyes and his body movement but he certainly reminded me of Peter Lorre and delivered that same type of creepy performance that you'd expect to see from Lorre. I'm not sure if Fritz Lang's M had any impact on the performance or if the director had it in mind but they are quite similar. The supporting players are fit their parts nicely and that includes Ashlynn Yennie, the actress from the first film who plays herself here. Those wanting the gore and violence won't be disappointed but this here is pretty much saved for the final half hour of the picture. We get some pretty graphic stuff that I won't spoil here but if you're familiar with the original film then it's pretty much the same stuff only much more brutal. I think the smart thing director Tom Six did with this sequel is that he filmed it in B&W. This is the perfect example of why B&W is such a beautiful format and it shows what you can do with it. The shadows, the perfect lighting and just what it adds to the atmosphere. This film would never have worked in color and I'd even say the mostly silent nature of the picture was another very big benefit.

9.0,"""The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)"" is a bizarre, depraved and often hilariously over-the-top exploitation film with a brilliant meta-edge... Worth seeing once...","There's really no way to describe writer/director Tom Six's ""The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)"" on IMDb. It's so grotesque, violent, over-sexualized and exploitive that it's near impossible to describe it in general, let alone here, where reviews should be ""PG"" rated. So I will try my best.""Human Centipede II"" is a strange hybrid of meta-fiction and satire of itself and of the first film (and is, to its credit, quite funny in a very ""gallows"" humor kind of way), while also being an extraordinarily grotesque and depraved ""body horror film"" at the same time. It's one of those movies that is borderline parody of its own concept (again, in a meta-fiction way), in the same vain as ""Gremlins 2"" or ""The Princess Bride.""Essentially the plot is as follows- ""Martin"", a mentally handicapped man whom has suffered from rampant abused his whole life, becomes fascinated by the original ""Human Centipede"" film (which is a movie-within-a-movie in this sequel), and begins to kidnap various people in order to re- create the grotesque experiment from the original film.I will not spoil anything else, but the film in its second half, is essentially a much more grotesque remake of the first film, albeit with different characters and different motivations.I really must give credit where it is due. Tom Six has crafted a beautiful film, at least in terms of visuals. The black and white photography has a fantastic contrast and despite being stylized, has an iconic look to it. I also found his direction in terms of camera placement and movement, though a bit over-reliant on the ""shaky cam syndrome"", to be vibrant, kinetic and clear. The film is also well- edited and the atmosphere just reeks of tension and humor.Like the first film, the acting is a mixed bag. Laurence Harvey, whom portrays the villainous ""Martin"" is actually a revelation, delivering a character that so far as I can remember, doesn't speak one work, yet manages to garner a lot of sympathy and horror. He's clearly unable to comprehend (or just unwilling to) the dramatic extent of what he does in this film, and his troubled past, which is alluded to, makes you feel sorry for him despite his sins. Ashlynne Yennie, one of the stars of the first film, returns, this time playing herself, as she is kidnapped by Martin due to her connection to the original film. Other centipede members (12 in all) are played by newcomers, and though I won't go into all of them, they are all adequate, though some sore thumbs bring the score down.The script, as I said, is an extreme and bizarre example of meta-fiction with elements of satire, parody, body-horror, family drama and many other genres thrown in. It's a compilation of differing (and sometimes conflicting) ideas. And it is interesting, though the script suffers at times due to disjointed pacing, clunky dialog and an over-reliance on shocks.All of that being said- I will address the one thing this movie does extremely well, and at times perhaps too well. The gore. This movie is one of the few films I've seen that made me have to look away. I'm a huge gore-hound, and I love my gory movies (I was able to sit through ""August Underground"", ""Cannibal Holocaust"", ""Salo"" and other extreme films), but this film took it to a disturbing new high... or low, depending on how you look at it. Featuring everything from realistic portrayals of teeth being tapped out with hammers, to skin being flayed and stapled, to depictions of graphic sexual violence, this movie will make your skin crawl, and may prove to be too much for even seasoned veterans. Be warned going in.That all being said, I think fans of horror should see this film at least once. I've seen it twice, and I still don't know whether I love it or hate it. It's one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, but it also has a highly enjoyable self-awareness and sense of humor, and I think that's what sets it apart from other extreme films. I'm giving this a 5 out of 10, because I don't know what else to give it.(EDIT: Upon two more viewings, my affections have grown for this film, and I updated my score to suit its entertainment value and satirical hilarity!)",human centipede ii full sequence is bizarre depraved often hilariously over top exploitation film with brilliant meta edge worth seeing once,theres really no way describe writer director tom sixs human centipede ii full sequence imdb its so grotesque violent over sexualized exploitive that its near impossible describe it general let alone here where reviews should be pg rated so i will try my best human centipede ii is strange hybrid meta fiction satire itself first film is its credit quite funny very gallows humor kind way while also being extraordinarily grotesque depraved body horror film at same time its one those movies that is borderline parody its own concept again meta fiction way same vain as gremlins 2 or princess bride essentially plot is as follows martin mentally handicapped man whom has suffered rampant abused his whole life becomes fascinated by original human centipede film which is movie within movie this sequel begins kidnap various people order re create grotesque experiment original film i will not spoil anything else but film its second half is essentially much more grotesque remake first film albeit with different characters different motivations i really must give credit where it is due tom six has crafted beautiful film at least terms visuals black white photography has fantastic contrast despite being stylized has iconic look it i also found his direction terms camera placement movement though bit over reliant shaky cam syndrome be vibrant kinetic clear film is also well edited atmosphere just reeks tension humor like first film acting is mixed bag laurence harvey whom portrays villainous martin is actually revelation delivering character that so far as i can remember doesnt speak one work yet manages garner lot sympathy horror hes clearly unable comprehend or just unwilling dramatic extent what he does this film his troubled past which is alluded makes you feel sorry him despite his sins ashlynne yennie one stars first film returns this time playing herself as she is kidnapped by martin due her connection original film other centipede members 12 all are played by newcomers though i wont go into all them they are all adequate though some sore thumbs bring score down script as i said is extreme bizarre example meta fiction with elements satire parody body horror family drama many other genres thrown its compilation differing sometimes conflicting ideas it is interesting though script suffers at times due disjointed pacing clunky dialog over reliance shocks all that being said i will address one thing this movie does extremely well at times perhaps too well gore this movie is one few films ive seen that made me have look away im huge gore hound i love my gory movies i was able sit through august underground cannibal holocaust salo other extreme films but this film took it disturbing new high or low depending how you look at it featuring everything realistic portrayals teeth being tapped out with hammers skin being flayed stapled depictions graphic sexual violence this movie will make your skin crawl may prove be too much even seasoned veterans be warned going that all being said i think fans horror should see this film at least once ive seen it twice i still dont know whether i love it or hate it its one most disturbing films ive ever seen but it also has highly enjoyable self awareness sense humor i think thats what sets it apart other extreme films im giving this 5 out 10 because i dont know what else give it edit upon two more viewings my affections have grown this film i updated my score suit its entertainment value satirical hilarity,0.5255785578557857,0.05733473347334736,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.26, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.34}"
,Shock Cinema at its finest and most repulsive!,"I really liked the original The Human Centipede. I was surprised by how tame it was as well. It really didn't show anything, and it was very subdued in its execution. It was also very well-made, and not some crappy and weak thriller. I liked that about it, but at the same time it got a little dull at times. Which is why I was completely excited for the sequel. I wanted it to come in a different style and vain and for it to be so much more gross. Does that say something about my mental health? Anyways, it didn't disappoint.Like the original, the sequel is well-made. The use of black and white gives it a tone of its own, and the cinematography is pretty damn excellent, making use of its textures very well. The script doesn't have much depth in it, but how can it? Many people as opposed to how well made a film is also ask what's the importance of it. What's the importance of this? I'm not sure Tom Six was trying to say anything here... not even sure he was trying to in the original. The thing is, he has complete control of this film and the type of film he wants to make. This is shock cinema at its finest. People go watch horror films, well how about a really horrifying film? It is a question to be asked about films like this. How far do people go to see films like this, and why do we? Michael Haneke pointed out this very question in his film Funny Games, and this film is exactly the type of film he would be pointing at and criticizing. But in fact, he would criticize us... and our reason for watching this. For me, I love me a really gross film. A Serbian Film is still the nastiest film I have ever seen, but that film's second half while nasty left me sorta bored. To me this type of film doing this is the ultimate disgrace it can do- to get you bored. This didn't. It's riveting cinematography, along with the performances, kept me entertained. Kudos not only to Laurence R. Harvey (who manages to be even better than the infamous performance of Deiter Laser) but also to his lunatic mom played by Vivien Bridson. They both manage to give the film a very dark humor tone during many scenes. Then the last 30 minutes, which are definitely too damn disgusting. Many scenes in this film are still in my head, and not just the gross scenes, but also many of the moments of the lead character and his weird mannerisms. I do want to note that I most likely saw the edited version. The unrated is nowhere to be found, so I do want to give the unrated a visit on DVD hopefully. The sequel is better than the original for these simple reasons- it is more disgusting while also being more entertaining and definitely more funny in a twisted way.

,Break out the Barf Bags...the Centipede has returned!,"An inferior sequel compared to the original, this film is an obvious attempt by director Tom Six to further shock his audience. Even though it is filmed entirely in Black and White and the main Villain has not one actual word of dialog, the film does succeed to shock. It's villain Martin's shocking and grotesque appearance alone is enough to make anyone want to vomit. Throw in the fact that he randomly likes to soil himself and is sexually obsessed with the original ""Human Centipede"" film and you have an original concept for a sequel that I do not believe has ever been done before. Martin's obsession leads him to create his own 'Human Centipede' this time with not just 3 but 12 segments! The plot takes some absurd twists and turns ignoring the fact that, as a security guard, Martin should be a little more conscientious of all of the security cameras filming his every move and abductions! Logic is thrown completely out of the window in exchange for pure shock value in this one. Consider the fact that, as a security guard who is mentally challenged, it is impossible for Martin to have the medical knowledge required to undergo such a surgical endeavor. Nearly all of the characters in this film are deplorable human beings from the insensitive mother who taunts Martin incessantly throughout the film to their belligerent neighbor who goes on a rampage simply because someone complains about his loud music. Martin even tricks one of the film's original stars, Ashlynn Yennie, into believing that she is auditioning for a Quinten Tarentino film and makes her the head piece of his centipede.

7.0,100% trashy.,"Writer / director Tom Six delivers shock value writ large in this sequel to his original ""Human Centipede"" film. He bathes this lowly story in tons of grime, gore, filth, and excrement. One has to give him some credit: he goes to absurd lengths to make his audience feel as sick as possible. The story takes place in ""reality"", as a supremely twisted loner named Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), the product of a sexually abusive childhood, fixates on the film ""The Human Centipede"", and determines to outdo the maniacal Dr. Heiter. He finds brutalizing and abducting various unfortunate schmucks to be very easy, as he sets about assembling a centipede four times the length of the original. And as Martin sets out to go Dr. Heiter one better, so too does Six set the bar higher than his first film in terms of its dark, unrelenting, disgusting outrageousness. He earns some points for his audacity; often viewers may not be able to believe what they're seeing. And, as mentioned, Martin isn't the only cretin to be found in this story; there was dear old dad, but there's also the depraved Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens), who has a yen for the diminutive, corpulent Martin. This is mostly filmed in a stark black & white, and what little burst of colour, I must warn prospective viewers, is of the brown variety. Still, it's hard not to laugh at how ridiculous this gets - there is a definite black humour to be found in the material at times. The expressive but nearly mute Harvey is uncomfortably effective as Martin, and he truly makes the skin crawl. It's amusing to see Ashlynn Yennie, star of the first film, returning to play ""herself"", lured to London under the pretense that she's getting an audition for a new Tarantino film. She and all of the various victims deserve good sport awards for being put through these kinds of paces. Foregoing any sort of opening credits, Six has this sequel just dive head first into the action. And while things do admittedly get a little draggy at times, the climactic money shots do make it worthwhile. This may not appeal to very many tastes - some viewers may find it utterly pointless, or calculated and cynical - but for others, it may be just what a seriously demented doctor would order.

8.0,"It's actually good, much better than the first (UNCUT REVIEW)","I had the opportunity to see this on its one week tour of Australia, and I was lucky enough to get tickets to the premiere followed by Q+A with Lawrence R. Harvey. Having literally just finished The Human Centipede before leaving to see this I was quite excited to see what Tom Six would do with this sequel (considering I stayed away from any reviews and spoilers). Well, I must say, Six has produced one of the best genre pieces in quite some time. It's a strange little movie, black and white, with a silent villain and an intense final half hour. It is well known that part of this film is Six responded to the negativity from horror fans of the first film, which was berated for not being extreme or sick enough. Now, I didn't LOVE the first film (I gave it a 6/10), but this was for different reasons. I though Six did a fantastic job with The Human Centipede, the direction and setting were fantastic, and the concept was just so screwed up! Where the first one fell short was the writing and acting from the three victims, which seriously detracted from the horror of the movie. With The Human Centipede II I think there has been a big improvement in writing and acting, but more importantly for Six, an increased amount of depravity.Martin is a parking garage attendant. A loner, with mother issues and who was abused by his father. Already mentally unstable, his fixation with The Human Centipede inspires him to create his own, by knocking people out in the garage, dragging them to an abandoned shed and using kitchen appliances to perform the surgery. The first fifty minutes aren't exactly violent, but still quite good. The scenes in Martin's apartment reek of David Lynch, and are darkly comic. Once Six gets into making the centipede there is a kind of joyfulness about it all that is disturbing, yet still enjoyable. Teeth are knocked out, tendons are cut, flesh is stripped and staple guns are used instead of stitches. The assembly of the centipede isn't the end, and what follows blends very dark humour with some very disturbing imagery.I won't go into anymore detail, needless to say, the uncut version is MUCH better than the cut version. Having read the descriptions of certain scenes in other versions, let me say, they are FAR worse here! So for those waiting for the uncut version you are in for a pleasant surprise. Lawrence R. Harvey, for a debut performance, is fantastic. He is easily one of the best horror villains to grace our screens in years. Meeting him afterwards was a pleasure, he is an incredibly friendly, well-spoken man. The cinematography is fantastic, the whole film has a dirty, grungy atmosphere.On a sad note, the film just got banned in Australia, a disappointing choice by the OFLC. Will this film ever see the light of day in Australia uncensored? Not in the near future. Much like A Serbian Film, an incredible viewing experience has been denied to adults who are able to consent to the films they want to see. I don't want to get into a censorship essay though! 8/10",its actually good much better than first uncut review,i had opportunity see this its one week tour australia i was lucky enough get tickets premiere followed by q with lawrence r harvey having literally just finished human centipede before leaving see this i was quite excited see what tom six would do with this sequel considering i stayed away any reviews spoilers well i must say six has produced one best genre pieces quite some time its strange little movie black white with silent villain intense final half hour it is well known that part this film is six responded negativity horror fans first film which was berated not being extreme or sick enough now i didnt love first film i gave it 6 10 but this was different reasons i though six did fantastic job with human centipede direction setting were fantastic concept was just so screwed up where first one fell short was writing acting three victims which seriously detracted horror movie with human centipede ii i think there has been big improvement writing acting but more importantly six increased amount depravity martin is parking garage attendant loner with mother issues who was abused by his father already mentally unstable his fixation with human centipede inspires him create his own by knocking people out garage dragging them abandoned shed using kitchen appliances perform surgery first fifty minutes arent exactly violent but still quite good scenes martins apartment reek david lynch are darkly comic once six gets into making centipede there is kind joyfulness about it all that is disturbing yet still enjoyable teeth are knocked out tendons are cut flesh is stripped staple guns are used instead stitches assembly centipede isnt end what follows blends very dark humour with some very disturbing imagery i wont go into anymore detail needless say uncut version is much better than cut version having read descriptions certain scenes other versions let me say they are far worse here so those waiting uncut version you are pleasant surprise lawrence r harvey debut performance is fantastic he is easily one best horror villains grace our screens years meeting him afterwards was pleasure he is incredibly friendly well spoken man cinematography is fantastic whole film has dirty grungy atmosphere sad note film just got banned australia disappointing choice by oflc will this film ever see light day australia uncensored not near future much like serbian film incredible viewing experience has been denied adults who are able consent films they want see i dont want get into censorship essay though 8 10,0.5621950424005219,0.10275114155251144,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.22, 'Angry': 0.09, 'Surprise': 0.28, 'Sad': 0.2, 'Fear': 0.22}"
,A Tom Six out of a ten-person centipede (Get it?),"You might be taken aback by my comedic summary regarding my vote to ""The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)"". I guess it's my way of dealing with this horrifying and utterly bleak film, which must be at least partly related to why black comedy exists; people need to amuse themselves and others to cope when it comes to something like this film. It could easily be why the first one is parodied on ""South Park"" in the enjoyable episode ""HUMANCENTiPAD"". In the New York Times interview ""A More Perfect Union"", writer and director Tom Six himself indicated this film has humour, like maybe when there's thunder and lightning when Martin, the main character, gives an angry facial expression to someone. I admit I kind of laughed at that, but I don't think I laughed at anything else. However, I did say things out loud a few times, like probably ""Oh God"" in a dismaying manner. More appropriate, I think.Martin is a demented, obese, and non-speaking man, played very well by newcomer Laurence R. Harvey. Martin works as a security guard in an underground parking garage and has a sexual obsession with the first film. Yup, the first film, which Tom Six also wrote and directed. However, whereas that one has three people sewn together ass to mouth, Martin sets out to have *twelve* for his human centipede. Why? For his own entertainment and sexual pleasure. Talk about an unusual sequel. He violently kidnaps some people in the parking garage. There's not a single bystander around, for whatever reason. I'm not sure if I buy that, but then again, I don't know how much realism Tom Six was going for. Martin keeps his centipede victims in a warehouse and eventually combines ten of them together, which makes my summary even more suitable.""The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)"" is in black and white. If it was in colour, especially with little or even no altering, the film would've still been bleak, of course, but as it is, boy, is it bleak. In a good way, nonetheless. It *sort of* reminds me of ""Eraserhead"", a David Lynch film I really admire. Both are eerie, weird, in black and white, don't have much dialogue, involve an infant or two, and have each main character living in an apartment. ""Eraserhead"" is weirder and definitely not as violent, though. If David Lynch saw this film, I wonder what he would think about it.If I look away when watching a film, it's usually because the film doesn't have me interested and not because there's something way too repulsive happening on the screen for me to even look at. With ""The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)"", I never looked away, though I almost did because it did get a bit too boring. Nonetheless, it's mostly effective with its unorthodox storytelling, grungy and downbeat look, and the acting. (I had a bit of trouble believing the couple at the beginning, but that's a nitpick.)There's a lot of human suffering and it largely comes from the victims in the warehouse. Even though they seriously lack characterization, I did care about them, at least somewhat. No sane person wants to go through their ordeal. I should mention I really enjoyed the first film. Even though the victims also lack characterization, they have more going for them and I strangely felt more sorry and supportive for them. It's probably because their pain wasn't overwhelming, they're main characters, and there's more focus on them potentially escaping. Here, the story is told mostly from Martin's perspective. He's definitely not somebody to root for. Why is he twisted? What's wrong with his sexuality? His sexual abuse by his father, whom we don't see in person, probably has something to do with those questions. Probably abuse by his mother, as well, whom he lives with. Yeah, this film hardly explores his past.How come we never see Martin talk? I don't know. I actually don't consider it a flaw, however. I'm so used to main characters talking in films and with the different way it's done here, I didn't mind. He's implicitly characterized, but at the same time, his behaviour is pretty unsurprising. I don't think main characters necessarily have to be likable as if they're a close friend, but they should be interesting, one way or another. It actually seems like we're suppose to feel sorry for him at times, like when his mother lays blame on him to an angry neighbour over something *she* did. I guess Martin deserves some pity there, but when it comes to the film as a whole, you'd probably be wishing him death or having him locked away in a mental institution. I pick the latter. Maybe it'd be interesting if his past was explored and if he used to normally talk, what his dialogue was like, but as the film is, I'm okay with him *as a character*.I didn't like or dislike ""The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)"". It's well shot, even though shots are depressing as hell, especially in black and white. I doubt the film is trying to say anything about someone who's inspired by violence in films to use violence in real life. I don't think the film absolutely should, either. In the aforementioned New York Times interview, Tom Six said that such a person is already insane. He's probably right. In an interesting way, this film ends ambiguously, which I won't spoil how, but the third and final film that's in the works will apparently begin with this film's ending, just like how this one begins with the ending of the first. This trilogy is Mr. Six's film centipede. What the heck is he gonna do with the last one? Maybe it should be a musical.",tom six out ten person centipede get it,you might be taken aback by my comedic summary regarding my vote human centipede ii full sequence i guess its my way dealing with this horrifying utterly bleak film which must be at least partly related why black comedy exists people need amuse themselves others cope when it comes something like this film it could easily be why first one is parodied south park enjoyable episode humancentipad new york times interview more perfect union writer director tom six himself indicated this film has humour like maybe when theres thunder lightning when martin main character gives angry facial expression someone i admit i kind laughed at that but i dont think i laughed at anything else however i did say things out loud few times like probably oh god dismaying manner more appropriate i think martin is demented obese non speaking man played very well by newcomer laurence r harvey martin works as security guard underground parking garage has sexual obsession with first film yup first film which tom six also wrote directed however whereas that one has three people sewn together ass mouth martin sets out have twelve his human centipede why his own entertainment sexual pleasure talk about unusual sequel he violently kidnaps some people parking garage theres not single bystander around whatever reason im not sure if i buy that but then again i dont know how much realism tom six was going martin keeps his centipede victims warehouse eventually combines ten them together which makes my summary even more suitable human centipede ii full sequence is black white if it was colour especially with little or even no altering film wouldve still been bleak course but as it is boy is it bleak good way nonetheless it sort reminds me eraserhead david lynch film i really admire both are eerie weird black white dont have much dialogue involve infant or two have each main character living apartment eraserhead is weirder definitely not as violent though if david lynch saw this film i wonder what he would think about it if i look away when watching film its usually because film doesnt have me interested not because theres something way too repulsive happening screen me even look at with human centipede ii full sequence i never looked away though i almost did because it did get bit too boring nonetheless its mostly effective with its unorthodox storytelling grungy downbeat look acting i had bit trouble believing couple at beginning but thats nitpick theres lot human suffering it largely comes victims warehouse even though they seriously lack characterization i did care about them at least somewhat no sane person wants go through their ordeal i should mention i really enjoyed first film even though victims also lack characterization they have more going them i strangely felt more sorry supportive them its probably because their pain wasnt overwhelming theyre main characters theres more focus them potentially escaping here story is told mostly martins perspective hes definitely not somebody root why is he twisted whats wrong with his sexuality his sexual abuse by his father whom we dont see person probably has something do with those questions probably abuse by his mother as well whom he lives with yeah this film hardly explores his past how come we never see martin talk i dont know i actually dont consider it flaw however im so used main characters talking films with different way its done here i didnt mind hes implicitly characterized but at same time his behaviour is pretty unsurprising i dont think main characters necessarily have be likable as if theyre close friend but they should be interesting one way or another it actually seems like were suppose feel sorry him at times like when his mother lays blame him angry neighbour over something she did i guess martin deserves some pity there but when it comes film as whole youd probably be wishing him death or having him locked away mental institution i pick latter maybe itd be interesting if his past was explored if he used normally talk what his dialogue was like but as film is im okay with him as character i didnt like or dislike human centipede ii full sequence its well shot even though shots are depressing as hell especially black white i doubt film is trying say anything about someone whos inspired by violence films use violence real life i dont think film absolutely should either aforementioned new york times interview tom six said that such person is already insane hes probably right interesting way this film ends ambiguously which i wont spoil how but third final film thats works will apparently begin with this films ending just like how this one begins with ending first this trilogy is mr sixs film centipede what heck is he gonna do with last one maybe it should be musical,0.5084117822213062,0.06332757850614998,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.1, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.38}"

Sure, it had a very disgusting premise, but other than that, it was a pretty generic horror movie, with dumb victims that are unable to do anything and a cartoonish villain (Personally, I found Dieter Laser performance in the first film so cheesy and over the top that I wasn't able to take it seriously)While this sequel tries to improve the flaws from the first film giving it some kind of ""arthouse""/David Lynch wannabe treatment, the final result still leaves too much to be desired, mostly because of the absolutely terrible script and the bland and one-dimensional characters. ""The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)"" starts with a shameless act of self-promotion from Tom Six, who makes the main character of this sequel a fanboy of the original ""The Human Centipede"" film. Why somebody would be so obsessed with such a forgettable and generic horror movie is a mystery to me, but to each his own, I guess.So this guy wants to be like the villain of the first movie, and then he tries to make his own Human Centipede capturing a random group of people, and all of them are easily captured by the fanboy (Seriously, why so many horror movies make the victim characters so dumb and incompetent? I mean, all the people who are captured to make the new human centipede are so unbelievably dumb and unable to have any kind of proper reaction when they are in trouble. Also, there are no cops in this world, or at least somebody able to realize that there is an abandoned baby inside one car) and then we have some glimpses of the pathetic life of this fanboy in order to understand why somebody would be obsessed with such a lame movie as The Human Centipede in first place. Those glimpses of the pathetic life of the fanboy are the best parts of the movie, because at least in those scenes he doesn't act as the generic invincible villain cliché that could be found in almost every horror film from the recent times. Other than that, there is nothing of interest here.Stupid. This movie is stupid. It tries too hard to be ""shocking"" and ""edgy"" that it ends failing in every other aspect. It is boring, uninteresting and lame, but at least it tried to be better than its predecessor. And I appreciate that.",slightly better than first film but thats not saying much,i just dont get whats big deal about original human centipede movie sure it had very disgusting premise but other than that it was pretty generic horror movie with dumb victims that are unable do anything cartoonish villain personally i found dieter laser performance first film so cheesy over top that i wasnt able take it seriously while this sequel tries improve flaws first film giving it some kind arthouse david lynch wannabe treatment final result still leaves too much be desired mostly because absolutely terrible script bland one dimensional characters human centipede ii full sequence starts with shameless act self promotion tom six who makes main character this sequel fanboy original human centipede film why somebody would be so obsessed with such forgettable generic horror movie is mystery me but each his own i guess so this guy wants be like villain first movie then he tries make his own human centipede capturing random group people all them are easily captured by fanboy seriously why so many horror movies make victim characters so dumb incompetent i mean all people who are captured make new human centipede are so unbelievably dumb unable have any kind proper reaction when they are trouble also there are no cops this world or at least somebody able realize that there is abandoned baby inside one car then we have some glimpses pathetic life this fanboy order understand why somebody would be obsessed with such lame movie as human centipede first place those glimpses pathetic life fanboy are best parts movie because at least those scenes he doesnt act as generic invincible villain clich that could be found almost every horror film recent times other than that there is nothing interest here stupid this movie is stupid it tries too hard be shocking edgy that it ends failing every other aspect it is boring uninteresting lame but at least it tried be better than its predecessor i appreciate that,0.5270032643508253,-0.07105044345898004,Negative,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.29, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.31}"
