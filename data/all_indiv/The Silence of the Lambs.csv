,In a Class by Itself,"Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die. The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster. Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal. Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal. At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster. They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema. Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film. This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece. 5 stars out of 5.",class by itself,brilliant best picture 1991 that never gets old silence lambs deals with young fbi cadet oscar winner jodie foster who is sent interview captured madman oscar winner anthony hopkins one greatest performances ever screen find out about serial killer ted levine who is stripping skin his female victims after they die fbi has had no luck with case agent scott glenn tries throw curve ball hopkins by sending foster hopkins is former doctor levine holds clues capturing unknown criminal needless say film takes many twists turns creating suspenseful thriller that has no equal at heart silence lambs are confrontations between hopkins foster they play complicated chess match words which results some greatest footage ever captured cinema hopkins dominates spite fact he has approximately 17 minutes time film this is film that will wrap itself around you you will likely never be able shake some key elements you have seen this amazing masterpiece 5 stars out 5,0.6424603174603175,0.1761904761904762,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.16, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.45, 'Sad': 0.13, 'Fear': 0.19}"
10.0,A Story And A Character That You Can't Forget,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic.""

9.0,A thrilling must see,"I just saw, for the second or third time, this cinematographic masterpiece, during an « UGC culte » evening, in Paris. The list of the Big Five Academy Award winners is short. There are currently three of them, in nine decades: It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and ... The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated by Thomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting including Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. In addition, the director Jonathan Demme delivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.Without unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman's private life.

10.0,A truly remarkable film,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention.

The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well.

,Absolutely Brilliant.,"Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment. Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters. It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.`Silence of the Lambs' is the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another. Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant. While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together. The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable. This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice. Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind. The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.Director Jonathan Demme is masterful. There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil. It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie. I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene. However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre. It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.Do not miss this movie.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see.",absolutely brilliant,sweeping all five major academy awards oscars best movie director actor actress screenplay is quite accomplishment doing it nearly year after film was released is miracle considering notoriously short attention span oscar voters it is powerful example how great movie can be when superb writers directors actors others work at top their craft silence lambs is story young fbi trainee clarice starling jodie foster who is summoned help find one serial killer called buffalo bill by interviewing another fosters performance is absolutely brilliant while anthony hopkins receives most well deserved praise his chilling portrayal incarcerated serial killer hannibal cannibal lector it is fosters performance that holds movie together fear she shows just behind her eyes makes clarices outward courage all more interesting vulnerable this is perfect way play part because it explains lectors interest clarice her only bargaining chip getting lectors help is let him feed her innermost secrets fears exchange his brilliant insights into psychotic mind title movie comes these exchanges is very poignant director jonathan demme is masterful there is one scene late movie that i will not spoil it is one most simply brilliant scenes ever staged movie i dont know if all credit goes demme or writers but there is moment film where suspense builds beautifully what seems be common movie scene however through skillful timing direction audiences assumptions are used against them when truth is revealed hint it involves doorbell it is shocking induced collective gasp audience i saw it with at theatre it set stage edge your seat climax do not miss this movie movie is incredibly suspenseful absolute must see,0.7387096774193548,0.2907258064516129,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.14, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.31, 'Sad': 0.24, 'Fear': 0.29}"

10.0,"Classic psychological, suspense brilliant - masterpiece best horror thriller ever made!","The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a classic psychological suspense brilliant masterpiece well acted and the best thriller ever made! This was my first film I saw on VHS as a teenager and I absolutely loved it. Right after seeing this flick, I heard about Hannibal (2001) Ridley Scot film a sequel to this psychological thriller flick, I rushed buying it right away. Saddly I was disappointed with Ridley Scott Hannibal.""Silence of the Lambs "" is a classic and I think people would agree. It is my number 1 favorite thriller ever made, mostly I have enjoyed Jodie Foster as FBI recruit Clarice Starling's. Jodie did a brilliant acting performance I have seen. I love this film to death I absolutely love everything about this film. Since the first time I saw her in Silence I went to seeing her in a movie theater 2002 Panic Room, it was her first film I saw in movie theater since than I love Jodie Foster but Silence will be her best film she ever made. I was disappointed with the sequel Hannibal, no Jodie Foster in it, no brilliant masterful Clarice. Julianne Moore was incompetent for me, she couldn't catch Hannibal. Clarice Starling character was based on Gillian Anderson's FBI Agent Dana Scully and I think The X-Files inspired this film. I am even convinced that The Lone Gunman three geeks were also based on this film. You have a nice shootout on the end with Clarice and Buffalo Bill and Clarice get's her man, spoils her plans saves the hostage and saves the day.The Silence of the Lambs is the 1991 thriller that was the feature film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and marked the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) Dr.Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste (you can interpret that as you like). He is scary and his the same time awesome including brilliant, you can't out smart him. Director Jonathan Demme is masterful directing this flick you have to be brilliant you have to keep thinking to solve the murder mystery. Scott Glenn acts beautiful as Jack Crawford. This flick got five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is no wonder why.Plot: FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by the Bureau to elicit Lecter's help in tracking down a notorious serial killer who has kidnapped a US Senator's daughter. Directed by Jonathan Demme (The Manchurian Candidate), the film would receive five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hopkins and Best Actress for Foster and Best Screenplay. Hopkins would reprise his role as Lecter in two more films: Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002).Real life killer Ed Gein was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill as well as the inspiration for Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. And the director Jonathan Demme was a film student of Roger Corman who makes a cameo in the movie. Roger Corman taught not only him, but I think other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. Ted Levine did a pretty solid job as a serial killer Buffalo Bill. This film is fun, intense, very well fast paced goes quickly around for those two hours.The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American horror-thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn. The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer.In the film, Clarice Starling, a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer, known only as ""Buffalo Bill"".This movie is a perfect 10 out of 10, it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth (Jonathan Demme) with a brilliant cast including Thomas Harris novel that was adapted from it.

8.0,Very Effective Thriller But Ultimately Overrated,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it",very effective thriller but ultimately overrated,its impossible comment silence lambs as being mere film its release was watershed popular culture has influenced myriad imitations that are far too numerous mention much this success is down director jonathan demme who has made film so effective by coming up with strikingly simple idea filming everything dim lighting which gives silence moody brooding atmosphere that was absent movies previous decade ironically enough this is as typical 90s film making as manhunter was 80s movies howard shores score also helps proceedings jodie foster gives sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine clarice starling watch scenes closely when clarice is company men dont you get feeling she has phobia about male species is she victim sexual abuse her childhood lesbian we never find out but fosters performance is multi layered its pity this aspect is never explored hannibal which sadly deletes this aspect clarice sadly silence was released with tidal wave hype which film doesnt live up who can forget stories that upon seeing this at cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back their cars im sorry but despite being good thriller its not that good i fail see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable sleep with lights off im also afraid say that much awards heaped upon film arent that well deserved either foster deserved oscar as did film possibly demme too but did ted tally his adapted screenplay all he seems have done is copy best bits harriss novel wholesale into screenplay without making effort improve anything ill probably be accused sacrilege but more times i see this film more times i ask myself how did hopkins win oscar best actor i dont even think hopkins should have qualified best actor category since role isnt screen long enough his performance is slightly hammy hannibal as played by hopkins resembles something along lines paedophile rather than serial killer who has maimed murdered munched adults despite having some reservations brian cox as hannibal manhunter you do believe his burly presence does have physical strength overpower his victims not so hopkins i know its very difficult perhaps even impossible but best way enjoy this movie is erase your mind fact that its one only three movies have picked up oscar all five main categories fact that it made headlines about being most terrifying film committed celluloid fact that it stands as 28th best movie ever this website it is very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing hype surrounding it,0.5533985260770975,0.08648977015048445,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.06, 'Surprise': 0.3, 'Sad': 0.22, 'Fear': 0.36}"
9.0,"""...Or else it gets the hose again""","If I had to pick a relatively recent movie that gets mistaken for something it's not more times than any other, I would probably choose this one. Even though Silence of the Lambs is frequently labeled as a horror film, I don't think this is entirely correct. Don't get me wrong, there's still several disturbing parts throughout it and the story itself is unsettling, but to me, this more closely resembles a crime movie with horror elements in the background. Probably the biggest reason this is mostly called a horror movie is because if you count it as such, it is the only horror film to ever win an oscar for best picture. The Exorcist and Jaws were nominated, but never won. Despite my comments on how this is more of a crime/drama film than horror, the horror element becomes apparent almost immediately because of one of the characters featured. The story follows a rookie working for the FBI named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is encountering much difficulty trying to find a serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill who has been abducting women and flaying their corpses. Clarice seems to understand that trying to comprehend the mind of a psychopath is like learning to tie a knot: you have to know how to tie one to untie it. If she can find a (less maniacal) serial killer and interview him, she might find out how Buffalo Bill's thought process works and predict where he'll show up next. To this end, Clarice is tasked with visiting the infamous Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a bloodthirsty madman who was once respected in the field of psychiatry. Now, he's a crazed murderer who eats other human beings. What makes Lecter so disturbing is how non-threatening he appears to be. He doesn't resemble a killer at all, at least not externally. He speaks in a very calm and patient manner with Clarice while discussing how to find Bill. After Clarice leaves Hecter's cell block, she's on the search for more evidence. Soon, a corpse of a young woman is found with several lacerations and skin mutilations indicative of Buffalo Bill's crimes. Strangely, a moth cocoon is found in her esophagus. Later on, we see how a seemingly innocent man acting too innocently for his own good asks a girl named Catherine (a senator's daughter) to help him place a heavy piece of furniture in the rear of his van. As she steps into the vehicle to make loading it easier, the guy (later shown to be Bill) assaults her and locks her inside. As she's driven to an unknown location, Clarice gets new orders to pressure Lecter into giving up more information on Buffalo Bill. As bait, she is told to tell him that he will be switched to a new prison if he complies. Lecter rejects the offer and will only give up the details if Clarice gives up secretive information about her own life. Lecter is moved to a cell in Tennessee where he tells the mother of the kidnapped Catherine that Bill's real name is Louis, but it's all nonsense. Clarice meets with Lecter again, who gives her a dossier on Bill. This time, the trust she puts in him does actually pay off and provide details, but Lecter has other ideas. The same day he meets with Clarice, he kills and mutilates his cell guards and then escapes via an ambulance after he switches costumes with a cop the paramedics thought was dead. Now that Lecter is free, Clarice is starting to feel the pressure even more. She eventually tracks Bill down to a house in Ohio after discovering his real name is Jame Gumb. At first, he seems like a stable, moderate person who has nothing wrong with him, but his body language obviously shows he's hiding something. A very awkward dialogue between him and Clarice follows, in which she determines he is Buffalo Bill after spotting a moth identical to the one placed in the mouth of the murdered woman from earlier. After a gunfight taking place in a huge and dark basement, Clarice kills Jame and discovers Catherine, who has been imprisoned in a large hole the entire time. Back at the FBI base, Clarice receives a celebration for her efforts, but one last ominous thing happens to her. Lecter calls her from a remote location, and says he's not going to bother killing her even though he's able to because the world is more interesting with her in it. He also hopes she'll leave him alone too, but Clarice can't comply with that. Lecter hangs up once he declares ""he's having a friend for dinner."" Movies like this make me realize how you don't need special effects or mindless action to make a compelling experience. What Silence of the Lambs does well is build tension. The audience is already aware of the fact that Lecter is a monster who deserves to be executed, but Clarice has no choice but to trust him so that she can stop another killer (the enemy of my enemy is my friend). Speaking of Lecter, Anthony Hopkins is the one who carries most of the movie. Despite only appearing for a combined time of around 24 minutes, he's so creepy you can't take your eyes off him. The reasons for this are obvious. Lecter may be a fictional character, but people like him do exist. The most terrifying murderers are the ones who don't feel the need to raise their voices, and he nails this performance. He's also not to be underestimated. You might think that a person with such a violent and grisly past must not be very intelligent, but Lecter is a highly adept and imposing man. He understands perfectly well what methods the cops are going to use to track him down, because he used to study the human mind. Jodie Foster as Clarice is obviously the person we are made to cheer for, as she is risking her life to track down a vicious killer as well as dealing with another madman who can end her life if he felt like it. So as you might expect, the acting in this movie is all good. Even George Romero makes an appearance after Lecter is transferred. Even though I like this movie, I have seen many saying it is overrated. That I can entirely understand. Many people don't think the performances of the two leading actors were oscar-worthy, even though acting well is a very hard thing to do. Lecter doesn't even appear that much in the movie but ended up being the most iconic thing about it. People who watched this soon found out why.",or else it gets hose again,if i had pick relatively recent movie that gets mistaken something its not more times than any other i would probably choose this one even though silence lambs is frequently labeled as horror film i dont think this is entirely correct dont get me wrong theres still several disturbing parts throughout it story itself is

10.0,A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars,"It is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.The psychological path of Hannibal is hard to trace. He is so odd a mixture of intelligence, cruelty, insanity, grace and charisma. In the depth, fledgling FBI trainee Clarice is no match of him. She is still naive yet very ambitious. On the trail of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, she's sent to interview him, a psychiatrist-turned-cannibal. Hannibal is willing to provide clues to finding the killer but only in return for personal information about Clarice herself. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. In those mind games, the two dance backward and forward between cannibal and FBI agent, mentor and student, psychiatrist and patient, father and daughter. It is Clarice who breathes life into the multidimensional sophisticated psychopath and Hannibal who nudges the aspiring student FBI agent and helps her achieve her first success in a world of Y chromosome where her guru Crawford uses her, embarrasses her, excludes her; Doctor Chilton regards her no more than a simple-minded woman and tries to flirt with her. Frankly speaking, though no lack of other impressive scenes, it's really the nerves fights between Hannibal and Clarice that carries the film.Some of the horrible scenes involve Buffalo Bill who, a transvestite, skins his victims, especially woman victims. But the most terrifying one is Clarice's single-handed trace in Buffalo Bill's gruesome den, which also has become another irony to the self-important testosterone-dominated world. Crawford's misjudgment and stubbornness makes him out of the right track, a special anti-terror deployment resulting in vain. But Clarice, though excluded from the business which she should be on, still holds onto her intuition and through on-the-spot investigation finds the serial killer at last. She has to take on him herself. (Demme uses ""deceptive cutting"" there to enhance the tension.) It is definitely a life-or-death fight, especially when Clarice is in the dark, groping her way in absolute terror. I have no doubt everyone holds the breath when the film rolls to that part.A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars",gripping film that well deserved its oscars,it is creepy taken by storm experience with film background music is darker than film itself too ominous plot is brilliantly constructed conversations are thought provocative crown whole jodie foster anthony hopkin are cream they take ownership clarice hannibal respectively transforming them into most unforgettable screen images psychological path hannibal is hard trace he is so odd mixture intelligence cruelty insanity grace charisma depth fledgling fbi trainee clarice is no match him she is still naive yet very ambitious trail serial killer buffalo bill shes sent interview him psychiatrist turned cannibal hannibal is willing provide clues finding killer but only return personal information about clarice herself he calls it quid pro quo those mind games two dance backward forward between cannibal fbi agent mentor student psychiatrist patient father daughter it is clarice who breathes life into multidimensional sophisticated psychopath hannibal who nudges aspiring student fbi agent helps her achieve her first success world y chromosome where her guru crawford uses her embarrasses her excludes her doctor chilton regards her no more than simple minded woman tries flirt with her frankly speaking though no lack other impressive scenes its really nerves fights between hannibal clarice that carries film some horrible scenes involve buffalo bill who transvestite skins his victims especially woman victims but most terrifying one is clarices single handed trace buffalo bills gruesome den which also has become another irony self important testosterone dominated world crawfords misjudgment stubbornness makes him out right track special anti terror deployment resulting vain but clarice though excluded business which she should be still holds onto her intuition through spot investigation finds serial killer at last she has take him herself demme uses deceptive cutting there enhance tension it is definitely life or death fight especially when clarice is dark groping her way absolute terror i have no doubt everyone holds breath when film rolls that part gripping film that well deserved its oscars,0.6417559523809524,0.06032738095238095,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.05, 'Angry': 0.02, 'Surprise': 0.21, 'Sad': 0.28, 'Fear': 0.45}"
10.0,One of the Greatest Thrillers of all Time.,"The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see.",one greatest thrillers all time,silence lambs is masterpiece you cannot miss its masterwork suspense that blends elements horror crime psychology into one tight smooth story its only third film history win academy awards all top five categories best picture best actor best actress best director adapted screenplay that imply something about its technical quality as film it features expertise level craftsmanship all departments filmmaking takes huge bonus exquisite performances put by its stellar cast after all these years silence lambs remains league its own is perfect exemplification just how great movie can become when all right elements come together work perfect harmony form complete whole based novel same name jodie foster stars as clarice starling top student at fbis training academy fbi agent jack crawford scott glenn wants clarice interview dr hannibal lecter anthony hopkins genius psychiatrist who is also violent psychopath serving life behind bars various acts murder cannibalism crawford believes that lecter may have insight into case serial killer called buffalo bill ted levine that murders skins his victims that starling as attractive young woman may be just bait make him help with case direction by jonathan demme is marvelous as film introduces its chilling sense dread has audience edge their seats moment howard shores ominous score hits screen till end film especially during climax with lot perfectly crafted suspenseful nail biting moments editing is perfect as pace is methodical start finish each every sequence is relevant story cinematography by tak fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating very dark brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize audience while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use close ups which increase creepiness tension along with displaying optimal color palette minimal lightning start finish which further enhances darker ambience story was aiming moreover production design team has done magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted richly detailed very well lit script by ted tally also packs very well structured tight plot every character has well defined arc all themes are smartly addressed attention detail is quite impressive complete story narrative are perfect performances are incredible jodie foster as clarice is absolutely brilliant gives impeccable performance as woman who is desperately trying forget her painful past yet at same time tries prove her worth male dominant world anthony hopkins as genius psychiatrist cannibalistic serial killer hannibal lecter is perfect amalgamation charisma high intelligence destructive violence gives bone chilling memorable performance that will stand passage time as one absolute best small amount screen time that hopkins is given is definitive testament his acting capabilities as with such elegant minimal performance he solidifies himself as one most iconic villains all time due charisma electrifying chemistry between two actors every scene they share becomes instant classic conclusion silence lambs is one greatest films ever made masterwork brilliant direction smart screenplay splendid camerawork tight editing marvelous score exquisite performances that cemented legacy both anthony hopkins jodie foster by engraving their iconic characters into annals cinema film absolutely deserves all accolades recognition it gets both its contributions cinema immense impact it had pop culture jonathan demmes magnum opus is outstanding achievement genre filmmaking that has inspired influenced countless thrillers since its release is not only quintessential suspense psychological horror film but also ingenious observation humanitys dark violent nature masterpiece that every film lover must see,0.6373392243495335,0.31617083946980845,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.15, 'Angry': 0.04, 'Surprise': 0.25, 'Sad': 0.23, 'Fear': 0.32}"
10.0,The granddaddy of all serial killer flicks,"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter.

9.0,iconic villain,"Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is recruited right out of Quantico by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) of the Bureau's Behavioral Science Services. He's investigating serial killer Buffalo Bill who skins his female victims. He's interviewing imprisoned killers but Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) refuses to cooperate. Starling is sent to talk to Lecter.Director Jonathan Demme takes the serial killer genre onto another level. It is brilliantly intense and brutal. It's a solid entry but then there is Hopkins' Lecter. It is an iconic villain for all times. From the moment he first appears, he steals the movie. It's rare that somebody can produce a character that is so original and so memorable. He is so impressive that he actually overshadows the penis-tucked human-skinning lotion-basket transvestite serial killer. Foster is also pretty solid. She brings a competence to the role that is needed for the outrageous villains to shine.",iconic villain,trainee clarice starling jodie foster is recruited right out quantico by jack crawford scott glenn bureaus behavioral science services hes investigating serial killer buffalo bill who skins his female victims hes interviewing imprisoned killers but dr hannibal lecter anthony hopkins refuses cooperate starling is sent talk lecter director jonathan demme takes serial killer genre onto another level it is brilliantly intense brutal its solid entry but then there is hopkins lecter it is iconic villain all times moment he first appears he steals movie its rare that somebody can produce character that is so original so memorable he is so impressive that he actually overshadows penis tucked human skinning lotion basket transvestite serial killer foster is also pretty solid she brings competence role that is needed outrageous villains shine,0.5932773109243697,0.13445378151260504,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.11, 'Angry': 0.05, 'Surprise': 0.32, 'Sad': 0.21, 'Fear': 0.32}"
9.0,Getting A Good Consultant,"It seems as though there is a serial killer out there who's grabbed the daughter of a United States Senator and this guy has zoomed right to the top of FBI's Most wanted. This man's modus operandi is to keep the victims alive for a while before killing them so they're racing against time to find him. Desperate situations call for desperate measures.The desperate measure is, you want to catch a serial killer, bring in one as a consultant. That's why FBI trainee Jodie Foster goes to visit Anthony Hopkins in prison. Hopkins is not just a killer who eats his victims, he's a brilliant psychologist himself with insights maybe no one else has.Of course his price are some cheap insights into Jodie Foster's soul, thrills he probably got when he was in practice.The Silence of the Lambs in less capable hands could have just been another cheap slasher flick. Instead the leads who walked off with the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress give riveting performances of a sick twisted psycho and a woman who became the biggest feminist icon since Sigourney Weaver by confronting some demons of her own. It's the best work that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have ever done and let's not forget the Oscars won by Director Jonathan Demme and the Picture itself for being the Best in 1991.A couple of players who made their marks on television later on also score well here. Anthony Heald who was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's handler plays the psychiatrist in the institute where Hopkins is incarcerated and who Hopkins makes a fool of and says at the end he's far from done with. Also Ted Levine who is Captain Stottlemeyer on Monk plays the serial killer the FBI is trying to catch. Also look for a good performance by Brooke Smith as Levine's potential victim.The Silence of the Lambs with its taut direction and riveting performances has an appeal far beyond the horror genre.

10.0,Love the suit......,"FBI agent Clarice Starling is assigned to help find a missing woman and save her from a serial killer who skins his victims. To gain a better insight into the twisted mind of the killer, she liaises with Hannibal Lecter, who used to be a respected psychiatrist, but due to hid palate, is now an inmate at a top security facility. FBI agent Jack Crawford believes that Lecter, who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator, has the answers to their questions and can help locate the killer. However, Clarice must first gain Lecter's confidence before the inmate will give away any information.......In 1991, this movie changed the way that thrillers and horror movies would be made for a very long time. For the next ten or so years, you couldn't move in a cinema for films that hugely relied on this movie, and its original source material.If it wasn't for this movie,mew wouldn't have Se7en, Kiss The Girls, or even the Saw franchise.Even though its a blooming scary, the film relies more on the manipulation of the protagonists, and the wonderful cat and mouse games played between key characters. There are so many red herrings going on, that the only genuine relationship in the whole movie is that of Lecter's and Starling's.And what performances we have from Foster and Hopkins. These are career defining performances, and yes, they were both prolific artists before the movie for years, but ask anyone about either two, and I guarantee they will mention this movie right away.The chemistry between the two is electric, and although they only share a few scenes, its cinematic gold.The camera-work is cold and stark, and the use of head shots subliminally breaking the fourth wall, adds to the tension, and almost makes you feel like you are in the actual narrative.Its a solid movie, gripping you from the bleak opening credits, right up to one of the best lines in the film.But the biggest surprise is the wonderful trick the film throws at you, duping you into thinking that the FBI are at the killers house, when it's just Starling at the door. Its a brilliant twist that would have shocked many when first seen, and then the lights go off.....All in all, its not just one of the defining movies of the nineties, its one of the greatest thrillers ever made.It's that brilliant.",love suit,fbi agent clarice starling is assigned help find missing woman save her serial killer who skins his victims gain better insight into twisted mind killer she liaises with hannibal lecter who used be respected psychiatrist but due hid palate is now inmate at top security facility fbi agent jack crawford believes that lecter who is also very powerful clever mind manipulator has answers their questions can help locate killer however clarice must first gain lecters confidence before inmate will give away any information 1991 this movie changed way that thrillers horror movies would be made very long time next ten or so years you couldnt move cinema films that hugely relied this movie its original source material if it wasnt this movie mew wouldnt have se7en kiss girls or even saw franchise even though its blooming scary film relies more manipulation protagonists wonderful cat mouse games played between key characters there are so many red herrings going that only genuine relationship whole movie is that lecters starlings what performances we have foster hopkins these are career defining performances yes they were both prolific artists before movie years but ask anyone about either two i guarantee they will mention this movie right away chemistry between two is electric although they only share few scenes its cinematic gold camera work is cold stark use head shots subliminally breaking fourth wall adds tension almost makes you feel like you are actual narrative its solid movie gripping you bleak opening credits right up one best lines film but biggest surprise is wonderful trick film throws at you duping you into thinking that fbi are at killers house when its just starling at door its brilliant twist that would have shocked many when first seen then lights go off all all its not just one defining movies nineties its one greatest thrillers ever made its that brilliant,0.5899169435215947,0.19100221483942414,Positive,"{'Happy': 0.06, 'Angry': 0.08, 'Surprise': 0.34, 'Sad': 0.17, 'Fear': 0.34}"
