      "{'content': 'This was one of the first Fox hour-long dramas, and Fox definitely wore its heart on its sleeve. Like WB now, Fox wanted to lure in a teenage audience with its good-looking young stars. Luckily for those stars, 21 Jump Street was a rather good vehicle, and stood on its own merits.Kind of like a Mod Squad for the 80s, the \"teens\" in 21 Jump Street were cops. Hip cops. They would infiltrate schools, drug rings, gangs, wherever teenagers were in trouble... unlike the Mod Squad, though, the storylines were always passable, and quite often excellent. Almost every episode touched upon subjects that were taboo for the big 3 networks (and still are)- AIDS, statutory rape, drug use, abortion, child abuse- and presented it in a moralistic way, but without being maudlin.The show kind of faltered in its last few seasons; Johnny Depp was becoming a star, and execs started pushing other \"stars\" into the spotlight, hoping for cash rewards and spin-offs. Richard Greico was most heavily promoted, to an audience that didn\\'t really care. He became a teen-age heartthrob for a while, but never achieved the momentum to carry his career skyward. With this pushing of the stars, the storylines took a back seat to character preening. The end result was faltering ratings, and cancellation.Until it became an actors\\' showcase, though, 21 Jump Street was probably the best drama on TV.', 'helpful': 40, 'title': 'Launching pad for teen stars; one of the better early Fox shows.', 'author': 'ur0014492', 'date': '10 October 1999', 'rating': None, 'not_helpful': 2}\n",

Many of the scripts dealt with what young people go through on a day to day basis and used a cop show to show it. Issues like date rape, drugs, teen suicide, school violence and incest were all covered in the first two years of this show. When Jump Street premiered, it was the shot heard round the world due to the fact that it was the very first show to air on the Fox network, which at the time was only being broadcast on Sunday nights and it ushered in a whole new era in television. Also, Johnny Depp wasn't the only good thing about this show.

It certainly had at least one cast member who became a mega star in Johnny Depp. When Depp left the show, it sputtered on for a while, but ultimately died when other regulars left as well.I might not agree with all of Johnny Depp's opinions, but I certainly have enormous respect for his artistic vision. He was good, he was very good as Officer Tom Hanson in 21 Jump Street, but he left at what turned out the right time for him before he was trapped as a juvenile teen idol forever and created one fantastic body of work as one of the best players around. He knew what he was capable of back in the day and the rest of us know it now too.I was surprised that Dustin Nguyen didn't break out from 21 Jump Street as well as a big star. He should have had a great career as an oriental leading man, he had the looks, talent and definitely the martial arts skill.In a way the Sixties handed off to the Eighties in the person of original captain of the Jump Street program, Frederic Forrest. He was one weird dude as the hippie type captain, a real refugee of the tune in, turn on, drop out generation. The character didn't work, so he was quickly dispatched and Steven Williams came on board as the new captain and a more traditional police authority figure.You can see a lot of future stars in 21 Jump Street, Jason Priestley and Brad Pitt did episodes back in the day. I liked the stories very much, the series regulars were as human and as flawed as some of the kids they were dealing with.I wish it had lasted longer, but maybe if Johnny Depp had stuck with it longer we might never have seen Captain Jack Sparrow.\", 'helpful': 26, 'title': 'Mod Squad Of The Eighties', 'author': 'ur2483625', 'date': '31 May 2007', 'rating': 8, 'not_helpful': 7}\n",

The show lasted a few seasons on Fox without network infiltration like other major networks. It lasted long enough to leave its mark on the baby network. Now there are a dozen shows like 21 Jump Street without the cleverness and the strive to be better than just the average shows on TV. In fact, the show was probably the first American drama on Fox to be filmed on location in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to cut costs. In the beginning of the Fox network lineup, 21 Jump Street launched a unique way of looking at secondary schools with a great cast.

With participation of a used car lot owner. In another someone is stealing calculators and other electronic gear inside the school after hours.In later 1st season episodes a girl turns up dead and raped, and the officers have to find the students responsible. There is a murder in it also. Then in yet another episode a student is working as a prostitute and helping a home theft ring in an effort to help her mother recover from a life of drugs. So not all of it was minor stuff.Johnny Depp is the main star and it is nice to see him as a \"normal\" 20- something, long before he became quirky and began to speak in a somewhat affected way.

Anyway, I had been waiting for years for a DVD release. Years. And then it came. I watched the first season thinking \"wow ! so lame !\" and what the heck is that electro-crap music ? I just thought I had embellished the show in my memory and that it just wasn\\'t that good anyway. Well, that\\'s part true. The dialogs are sometimes so cheesy they make me want to puke. No wonder Johnny Depp couldn\\'t\\' wait to get the hell out of this show ! I hadn\\'t understood his move at the time, but now, do I ! So, in search for comfort, I watched season 3 (without bothering with season2). And I watched \"Swallowed alive\". Aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ! Totally ruined !!! What have they done to my episode ?!! Even though I knew there wouldn\\'t be the original music because, well, none of the other episodes had their music, I kinda hoped they would have replaced it with something that would keep the spirit of the episode. Boy was I disappointed. Elevator music wouldn\\'t have been worse ! So, my box set made an express on ebay and I am now 21 jump street-free. I was so looking forward to jumping back in my 15 year-old skin... Well, I guess that won\\'t happen anytime soon. And you know what the worst part is ? I had that episode on tape. And some stupid family member taped over it.

Some of these episodes could be aired *today* and still be relevant and have an impact.I definitely thought the show was going a bit downhill in season 3. Adding Richard Grieco to the cast did not help; I liked neither him nor his character and was happy to see him gone. Overall, I must say that the second season was the best, with tightly-written episodes, strong characterization and outstanding acting (\"Orpheus 3.3\" springs to mind as an example of truly breath-taking acting on Johnny Depp\\'s part).Well, what more can I say that hasn\\'t been said? If you ever get the chance, check this show out.

      "{'content': \"Oh, I hated Johnny Depp for years because of this show. Not that I watched it or knew who he was, but he was on this show and it came on at 7pm on Fox on Sundays and it sucked. Why? I don't know... it just sucked. Boy did it suck.And so in 1993, while working a summer job in a podunk town, I found it on when I came home for lunch one afternoon. I wasn't sure what it was at first, but I suspected it was that horrible, pathetic show. I figured I'd watch it... nothing like seeing a train wreck to cheer you up on a bad day, right? But then I realized it was time to go back to work and I couldn't go... 'cos I had to see the full wreck. And then I realized I timed my lunch hour to the same time the next day... and the next. You guessed it. I liked the show.Really, I don't know why I hated the show... probably because, like most people who are completely firm in their negative opinions, I had had no real exposure to it. I found (after watching, mind you) that the plots were decent, the actors from passable to excellent, and the writing and dialogue better than average. Depp and Peter Deluise worked well together, particulary when they worked as the McQuaid Brothers. Stephen Williams became a favorite actor of mine with his portrayal of Captain Fuller (he was later X on the X-Files.) As much as they were used, Holly Robinson and particularly Dustin Nguyen were never used as well as they could have been, but they were still good.Someone else mentioned that this because a star vehicle after a while. Despite the amount of future stars, I tend to disagree. Many of these faces were being seen for the first time here and no one could have guessed that they'd become famous. Brad Pitt, Pauly Shore, Sherilyn Fenn, Jason Priestly, Shannon Doherty, and several others had fleeting guest spots on the show and eventually went off to do bigger things, but there was also a long list of other actors on the show who went on to do very little or nothing at all.Another note (heh) that should be mentioned is that the show was one of the first to push a lot of popular music of the day in the soundtrack. I remember one epsiode about an AWOL military school student featured R.E.M.'s Orange Crush (off of the just released Green album). I believe the final Johnny Depp episode had an Oingo Boingo song from the Dark at the End of the Tunnel album... and don't knock Boingo... lead singer/composer Danny Elfman has been a respected film composer for over 15 years now. I believe a soundtrack was released, but I don't think many of the good songs were released on it.As the show went on, it became a little unbelievable that they could keep hitting the same schools without the students catching on or talking to each other to rat out the undercover officers. The writing got really bad in some episodes and Depp seemed to be giving bad performances just so he could get out of his contract. They allowed him to skip several episodes completely or limited his appearances in others as a result. After he left and the show went from FOX into general syndication for the last season, more and more shows were throwaways. The cast and guest stars suffered as well, with Robinson left to carry the show almost by herself (Peter Deluise guested on a handful of early episodes while brother Michael ended up on about half.) All in all, the last season is disappointing apart from a sparse handful of ok episodes.Like others, I'd love to see these on DVD, but I really don't expect it. It was a great show for a while, but when you lose the good producers and writers, even the best actors are going to have a tough time with working something out.\", 'helpful': 4, 'title': 'Before there was 90210, there was Jump Street', 'author': 'ur1549204', 'date': '14 June 2002', 'rating': None, 'not_helpful': 5}\n",

      "{'content': '\\'21 Jumpstreet\\' only escaped being totally forgotten by television viewers because it\\'s early star, Johnny Depp, would go on to gain such widespread cinematic notoriety. Otherwise, the exaggerated after-school-special styled cop drama would be completely dismissed as incredibly cheesy and ridiculous. Granted, the series, which follows the \"Jump Street\" program managed by one police captain and four baby-faced detectives who occasionally go undercover at high schools and such to investigate the latest of teenagers gone wild, did bring attention to pressing issues of drug use, teen pregnancy, school violence, racism and other topics that don\\'t even get an ounce of attention in today\\'s television programs geared toward young viewers.But, it did so in such a way that almost mirrored late 1970s and early 1980s dramas like Class of 1984 which featured completely out-of-control urban teens raising hell much to the confusion and chagrin of various adult authority who just assume wipe them out completely in order to avoid wasting time trying to get them to stop their craziness. It is hard to watch Jumpstreet reruns and take much of any of it seriously. The dialog was bad enough, but the situations themselves are written with such absurdity. In the second season episode, \"After School Special,\" a student shoots a teacher, and Hoffs and the police captain both go undercover to investigate gun dealers at school. We find out that pretty much every student is packing heat and lots of teachers are or soon intend to be as well. As if this weren\\'t stupid enough, the gang seems to take measures lightly considering the amount of arms floating around on campus.The series became as dated and cheesy as a lot of the other cautionary television shows similar to it (Highway to Heaven is one that comes to mind), and especially at the beginning of the second season. Unfortunately, it was hard to take seriously any of the youth-centered issues it had hoped to address, leaving it only valuable as a source of nostalgia (there were a lot of familiar faces in guest starring roles, and almost as many mullets).', 'helpful': 2, 'title': 'Instantly forgettable were it not for Johnny Depp. (spoilers)', 'author': 'ur1588706', 'date': '16 July 2006', 'rating': 2, 'not_helpful': 8}\n",

      "this was definitely quality show this show was far cry what fox network eventually became many scripts dealt with what young people go through day day basis used cop show show it issues like date rape drugs teen suicide school violence incest were all covered first two years this show when jump street premiered it was shot heard round world due fact that it was very first show air fox network which at time was only being broadcast sunday nights it ushered whole new era television also johnny depp wasnt only good thing about this show peter deluise holly robinson peete dustin nguyen all made this show one cult classics 1980s \n",

      "it took another 20 years another generation before we were ready another cop show with young people as undercover cops dealing with crime other social issues but where mod squad left off sixties 21 jump street took ball ran with it eighties personally i think 21 jump street was much better show it certainly had at least one cast member who became mega star johnny depp when depp left show it sputtered while but ultimately died when other regulars left as well i might not agree with all johnny depps opinions but i certainly have enormous respect his artistic vision he was good he was very good as officer tom hanson 21 jump street but he left at what turned out right time him before he was trapped as juvenile teen idol forever created one fantastic body work as one best players around he knew what he was capable back day rest us know it now too i was surprised that dustin nguyen didnt break out 21 jump street as well as big star he should have had great career as oriental leading man he had looks talent definitely martial arts skill way sixties handed off eighties person original captain jump street program frederic forrest he was one weird dude as hippie type captain real refugee tune turn drop out generation character didnt work so he was quickly dispatched steven williams came board as new captain more traditional police authority figure you can see lot future stars 21 jump street jason priestley brad pitt did episodes back day i liked stories very much series regulars were as human as flawed as some kids they were dealing with i wish it had lasted longer but maybe if johnny depp had stuck with it longer we might never have seen captain jack sparrow \n",

      "this was foxs first serious drama it was aimed at young audience 21 jump street had great cast including young johnny depp peter deluise holly robinson among cast members good writing innovative plot about young cops posing as high school students capture wide variety criminals school system show lasted few seasons fox without network infiltration like other major networks it lasted long enough leave its mark baby network now there are dozen shows like 21 jump street without cleverness strive be better than just average shows tv fact show was probably first american drama fox be filmed location vancouver british columbia canada cut costs beginning fox network lineup 21 jump street launched unique way looking at secondary schools with great cast it was never awarded emmy which it should have been even nominated best drama \n",
      "\n",
      "this television series held its own i remember waiting patiently next episode air when i was 13 loving every second it call it contrived superficial but i grew up with judy hoffs tom hansen doug penhall harry ioki adam fuller dennis booker i loved every second it johnny depp might renounce fact that he was ever connected with this show but it provided hours entertainment many individuals me it is reminder time my youth where i was completely innocent \n",
      "\n",
      "show really was mod squad 1980s kids that could not be taken seriously as cops but good captain there decided put them undercover as hs students though they were their early mid twenties there depp was show but that it suffered indeed when it left when other regulars leaving it would lead cancellation show was one very first shows land at fledging fox 1987 launch there did not shy away fron subjects day like drugs race crime etc \n",

      "i recently bought first season this show is still as good as anything television today if not better its been at least 10 years since i had seen episode so it was like watching show first time great theme song great actors terrific scripts if it wasnt some 1980s hair clothing this show could be airing prime time today without question its makes you want go back high school again walk halls with immunity because theres nothing that any gang or teacher can do you only problem is even after watching entire 1st season i have no idea what town show takes place oh well i truly hope that there are plans release rest seasons real soon \n",

      "this was top notch series that featured youthful looking police officers who would infiltrate high schools investigate crimes like drugs prostitution episodes were top notch well written timely watch i always enjoy watching them it was good concept if you get chance definitely watch some episodes it did wonders fox network johnny depps career out \n",
      "\n",
      "movie that came out was good but it couldnt hold candle this classic show that jump started johnny depps career i remember watching this it along with married with children jump started fox network as it featured youthful looking police officers infiltrating high schools order investigate crimes there drug dealing rape etc as well as other serious issues such as aids it was really good show anyone interested 80s tv ought give it look holly robinson peete reprised her role it channing tatum movie it involved good serious police work excellent ensemble performances check it out if you get chance out \n",
      "\n",
      "currently popular are recent jump street movies with channing tatum 21 jump street more recently 22 jump street i had never seen original 1980s tv series so i checked out two dvd set season one episodes very basic premise is same old church at 21 jump street is used as makeshift police headquarters sorts group 4 young looking 20 something cops who get assignments infiltrate high schools solve crimes typically some sort theft one episode two students auto mechanics class steal cars strip them overnight store parts put bare chassis back street later buy chassis small price re assemble cars sell it big profit with participation used car lot owner another someone is stealing calculators other electronic gear inside school after hours later 1st season episodes girl turns up dead raped officers have find students responsible there is murder it also then yet another episode student is working as prostitute helping home theft ring effort help her mother recover life drugs so not all it was minor stuff johnny depp is main star it is nice see him as normal 20 something long before he became quirky began speak somewhat affected way just light entertainment i enjoyed temporary throwback simpler time tv series isnt much like recent jump street movies \n",

      "great see that show has hit dvd format watched few episodes so far season 1 great show dont know why it was not reruns anywhere here canada noticed some over dubs some dialogue not sure if that was done back when show was fox or if it has been done when putting it dvd looks like some words are overdubbed could swear that ass was said originally but you get different word said watch actors mouth when dialogue seems bit louder briefly what gem though this show was always will be holly robinson is so sexy still is today i wonder what johnny depp thinks this being out now dvd he never liked doing show after 3rd season but stuck it out his contract duration would be nice hear his comments have him extra features too bad \n",

      "i remember this as shows that helped launch fox as network between this adventures beans baxter werewolf traci ullman simpsons i really enjoyed this show most its run last season with grieco did not leave me with too many fond memories but first several seasons i definitely made room my sunday lineup see this show most part stories were good i just wish there was someplace that showed re runs 21js with deluge cop shows nowadays i still think i could make time see 21js \n",

      "21 jump street is best cop show ever here it is 2002 still ive never enjoyed police tv program better team will always be my favorite tv show but 21 jump street is very close second i believe they were produced by same person stephen j cannell i wonder why team actors never made cameos steven williams dustin nguyen made appearances team oh well 21 jump street has never had equal police drama it should have been brought back regular tv i guess ill just have live with few episodes i have tape when i was child \n",

      "after seeing 2012 movie adaptation with jonah hill channing tatum i wanted go back watch series it was based during middle season 2 i lost interest set it aside until 2014 sequel 22 jump street came out so i decided pick up where i left off id say first 3 seasons are best season 5 is almost unwatchable it really goes downhill after johnny depp leaves i understand depp hated being show tried like crazy get kicked off it was cool that he peter deluise holly robinson returned movie cameos my eyes movie is sequel this series 25 years before schmidt jenko entered jump street there was tom hanson doug penhall judy hoffs h t ioki booker majority series they go undercover high school posing as students bust drug dealers rapists murderers other times they go undercover different places trying infiltrate gang or just trying protect themselves vengeful mobsters if you loved 2012 movie or early cop dramas you might enjoy 21 jump street complete series \n",

      "what groundbreaking show credit producers casting dustin nguyen mainstream role mainstream incredibly popular police drama i commend producers not making attempt whitewash harry iokis role looking at you people behind american series kung fu which should have featured bruce lee first three seasons were solid there was wonderful rapport amongst unit they looked out each other unfortunately direction got bit languid when dustin nguyen johnny depp no longer featured chemistry was missing something was lacking x factor i guess i was impressed with richard greicos appearance his spin off series booker was very underrated sadly it was shame officer dean garrett david barry gray officer kati rocky alexandra powers only appeared handful episodes as they had real potential \n",

      "airing during reagan era this show evidences reactionary politics that changed this country permanently much worse entering 1980s most americans were legitimately suspicious afraid their own government dating back repressive period viet nam war one main areas concern moderate liberals 1980s was abuse so called undercover operations by politically motivated police many which had unfairly targeted students left wing sympathies although 21 jump street didnt always betray its right wing bias openly it may have had effect propagandizing favor real world undercover operations aimed against youngsters kids make enemies all time which is usually harmless enough but what if that enemy is secretly working cops police like one portrayed by johnny depp should have wear badges \n",

      "21 jump street was show where it showed cops as attractive ultra hip stylish people time at which it came out was when cocaine heroin were really cool so this was kind like propaganda show where it had up side not doing drugs johnny depp peter deluise were always fast witted cool kids because they were drug free upholded law it usually seemed corny but something about it was fun always seeing them having fun while doing their jobs was so cool i can understand how johnny depp wanted quit because it didnt show lot things like police corruption or that it was completely unrealistic plots were contrived but with adequate directing campy script combined with good acting it was great show billy \n",

      "oh i hated johnny depp years because this show not that i watched it or knew who he was but he was this show it came at 7pm fox sundays it sucked why i dont know it just sucked boy did it suck so 1993 while working summer job podunk town i found it when i came home lunch one afternoon i wasnt sure what it was at first but i suspected it was that horrible pathetic show i figured id watch it nothing like seeing train wreck cheer you up bad day right but then i realized it was time go back work i couldnt go cos i had see full wreck then i realized i timed my lunch hour same time next day next you guessed it i liked show really i dont know why i hated show probably because like most people who are completely firm their negative opinions i had had no real exposure it i found after watching mind you that plots were decent actors passable excellent writing dialogue better than average depp peter deluise worked well together particulary when they worked as mcquaid brothers stephen williams became favorite actor mine with his portrayal captain fuller he was later x x files as much as they were used holly robinson particularly dustin nguyen were never used as well as they could have been but they were still good someone else mentioned that this because star vehicle after while despite amount future stars i tend disagree many these faces were being seen first time here no one could have guessed that theyd become famous brad pitt pauly shore sherilyn fenn jason priestly shannon doherty several others had fleeting guest spots show eventually went off do bigger things but there was also long list other actors show who went do very little or nothing at all another note heh that should be mentioned is that show was one first push lot popular music day soundtrack i remember one epsiode about awol military school student featured r e m s orange crush off just released green album i believe final johnny depp episode had oingo boingo song dark at end tunnel album dont knock boingo lead singer composer danny elfman has been respected film composer over 15 years now i believe soundtrack was released but i dont think many good songs were released it as show went it became little unbelievable that they could keep hitting same schools without students catching or talking each other rat out undercover officers writing got really bad some episodes depp seemed be giving bad performances just so he could get out his contract they allowed him skip several episodes completely or limited his appearances others as result after he left show went fox into general syndication last season more more shows were throwaways cast guest stars suffered as well with robinson left carry show almost by herself peter deluise guested handful early episodes while brother michael ended up about half all all last season is disappointing apart sparse handful ok episodes like others id love see these dvd but i really dont expect it it was great show while but when you lose good producers writers even best actors are going have tough time with working something out \n",
